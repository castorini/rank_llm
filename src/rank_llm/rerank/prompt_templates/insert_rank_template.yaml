  Rerank the above {num} passages based on their relevance to the query. Consider both the document content and the BM25 scores as signals for relevance. All the passages should be included and listed using identifiers, in descending order of relevance. The output format should be [] > [], e.g., [2] > [1]. Return the ranking as a list of numbers from 1 to {num}, most relevant first. Answer concisely and directly and only respond with the ranking results, do not say any word or explain.
