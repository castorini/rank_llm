You can feel it if you touch the front of your throat. It looks similar to a vaccum cleaner hose in that it has ridges. These ridges keep the shape of the thrachea as you breath since there is air moving in and out of it.he air we breath passes through here and to the lungs for oxygenation. The trachea is what is also known as the windpipe. When you 'suck down air', the oxygen takes the path down the trachea, then the bronchi, then the bronchioles, and the alveoli.",
