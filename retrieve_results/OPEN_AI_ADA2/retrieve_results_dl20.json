Most happen because the fertilized egg in the uterus does not develop normally. Stress, exercise, or sex does not cause a miscarriage. While many miscarriages pass on their own, some do not. These are called incomplete miscarriages because all of the tissue related to pregnancy is not shed from the uterus. An incomplete miscarriage often requires treatment. Medicine or a procedure call dilation and curettage (D&C) is used to clear the tissue from the uterus.

The average wind speed will also determine how expensive a model is required.ore affordable wind turbines range from $200 to $600. These turbines are typically smaller, which means less electricity is generated. Larger wind turbines can cost as much a \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 s $2,000 for those used in the home and upwards of $20,000 for those used industrially. 1 person found this useful.",
