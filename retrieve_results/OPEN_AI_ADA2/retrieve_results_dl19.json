Mechanical ventilation provides the force needed to deliver air to the lungs in a patient whose own ventilatory abilities are diminished or lost.

A variety of medical conditions can impair the ability of these muscles to accomplish this task, including: muscular dystrophies.",

A common way to prevent this is contour ploughing. What is... Making slopes into steps so that rain cannot run down a hill carrying soil off. When building terraces, it is important to stabilize the slope. -The easiest way to do this is to plant grass. If there is enough rock around it may be possible to construct a wall out of them.
