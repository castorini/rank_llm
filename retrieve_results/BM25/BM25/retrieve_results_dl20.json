Wind Turbines operate on a simple principle. The energy in the wind turns two or three propeller-like blades around a rotor. The rotor is connected to the main shaft, which spins a generator to create electricity. How fast do the blades turn? At the optimum wind speed of 25-35 mph, the blades will rotate at 14 rpm. That gives them a speed of 105 mph at the tip. How much electricity do they produce? Each turbine produces about 2,000,000 kilowatt hours (kwh) per year, enough energy to power as many as 500 typical homes at 12,000 kwh per year. How strong do the winds have to blow for the blades to rotate? Wind turbines start operating at wind speeds of around 8 mph and reach a maximum power output at around 33 mph. When there is not enough wind to turn the blades, or when there is too much wind the turbines shut down.",

It is the step in grain preparation after harvesting and before winnowing, which separates the loosened chaff from the grain. Threshing does not remove the bran from the grain. Threshing may be done by beating the grain using a flail on a threshing floor. Another traditional method of threshing is to make donkeys or oxen walk in circles on the grain on a hard surface.",

Sound cannot travel through empty space; it is carried by vibrations in a material, or medium (like air, steel, water, wood, etc). As the particles in the medium vibrate, energy is lost to heat, viscous processes, and molecular motion. So, the sound wave gets smaller and smaller until it disappears. In contrast, light waves can travel through a vacuum, and do not require a medium. In empty space, the wave does not dissipate (grow smaller) no matter how far it travels, because the wave is not interacting with anything else.",
