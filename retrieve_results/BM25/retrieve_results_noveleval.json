It complements the role of the G20, which is widely regarded as the framework for ongoing global economic coordination. In 1977, representatives of the then European Community began participating in the London summit. The role has expanded over time, with the EU gradually included in all political discussions on the summit agenda and, from the Ottawa summit (1981) onwards, has taken part in all working sessions. The European Union is a unique supranational organisation \u2013 rather than a sovereign Member State \u2013 hence the name G7 \u201cGroup of Seven\u201d. The EU is therefore a \u201cnon-enumerated\u201d member and does not assume the rotating G7 presidency. The summit gathers leaders from the European Union and the following countries: Canada France Germany Italy Japan the United Kingdom the United States. It is capable of setting the global agenda because decisions taken by these major economic powers have a real impact. The political direction set by these leaders on a policy issue will have a \u201cripple\u201d effect across many other international organisations and institutions.

Crossover credit mainly covers those bonds rated \u201cBB\u201d by the principal rating agencies. These companies will usually have more debt or greater cyclicality than investment grade issuers. The leverage ratio, which compares debt to earnings before interest, tax and depreciation, is typically between three and four times for BB-rated companies. This segment of the market is around half of the global high yield bond opportunity set by value and covers a range of economic sectors, including telecoms, autos, energy, healthcare, consumer products and financial services. In general, we believe that these issuers offer reasonable risk-adjusted returns. The average US dollar yield on global BB companies at the end of February was roughly 7%. While the BB segment is classified as \u201cnon-investment grade\u201d, we believe many of these companies are quite capable of servicing their liabilities over the medium term. Moody\u2019s data since 1983 suggests that the average loss rate for BB issuers is small: normally less than 1% per annum. Averages can be misleading, because there\u2019s variation within the group, but we consider this level of delinquency quite manageable, especially with the help of active security selection. Defaults are not the only consideration: clearly there are other factors to consider, such as liquidity risk and downgrade risk, but generally we think BBs offer a compelling trade off of risk against reward. In summary, we think the BB market offers a sweet spot for corporate bond fund managers where they can capture some of the yield from non-investment grade debt, without taking exposure to as many \u2018blow-ups\u2019.", "score": 0.07142857142857142, "qid": 11, "rank": 14, "docid": "11-13"}, {"content": "The Dutch are trying to find a middle ground between the US and China in an escalating battle over the world\u2019s chip supply chain.

After high school, he moved to Hawaii, where he landed a lead role, beating out of thousands of hopefuls in the TV series Baywatch (1989) (known as \"Baywatch Hawaii\" in its 10th season).

In 2004, after the short-lived TV series North Shore (2004), he was cast as the popular character \"Ronon Dex\" in the TV series Stargate: Atlantis (2004), which achieved a cult-like following.

This next-generation release includes a Stable version of Accelerated Transformers (formerly called Better Transformers); Beta includes torch.compile as the main API for PyTorch 2.0, the scaled_dot_product_attention function as part of torch.nn.functional, the MPS backend, functorch APIs in the torch.func module; and other Beta/Prototype improvements across various inferences, performance and training optimization features on GPUs and CPUs. For a comprehensive introduction and technical overview of torch.compile, please visit the 2.0 Get Started page. Along with 2.0, we are also releasing a series of beta updates to the PyTorch domain libraries, including those that are in-tree, and separate libraries including TorchAudio, TorchVision, and TorchText. An update for TorchX is also being released as it moves to community supported mode. More details can be found in this library blog.

As always, we encourage you to try these out and report any issues as we improve 2.0 and the overall 2-series this year. Summary: torch.compile is the main API for PyTorch 2.0, which wraps your model and returns a compiled model. It is a fully additive (and optional) feature and hence 2.0 is 100% backward compatible by definition. As an underpinning technology of torch.compile, TorchInductor with Nvidia and AMD GPUs will rely on OpenAI Triton deep learning compiler to generate performant code and hide low level hardware details. OpenAI Triton-generated kernels achieve performance that\u2019s on par with hand-written kernels and specialized cuda libraries such as cublas. Accelerated Transformers introduce high-performance support for training and inference using a custom kernel architecture for scaled dot product attention (SPDA). The API is integrated with torch.compile() and model developers may also use the scaled dot product attention kernels directly by calling the new scaled_dot_product_attention() operator. Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) backend provides GPU accelerated PyTorch training on Mac platforms with added support for Top 60 most used ops, bringing coverage to over 300 operators.

Thirty-four years later, its live action re-release is capturing a new generation with a bright and vibrant retelling of the mermaid\u2019s aquatic adventures. The remake of the Disney classic follows Ariel, (Halle Bailey) a young mermaid who falls in love with the reigning prince of the nearby human town after rescuing him from a shipwreck. Tailed by her sea creature friends Flounder (Jacob Tremblay) and Sebastian (Daveed Diggs), Ariel makes a deal with Ursula (Melissa McCarthy), a sea witch, to exchange her voice for legs in an effort to see Prince Eric (Jonah Hauer-King) again. Despite the best confounding efforts of many, Ariel eventually finds her happy ever after with the prince. Bailey gave a radiant performance as the bubbly protagonist. While it can often be difficult to adapt an animated character, Bailey\u2019s portrayal perfectly captured the young mermaid\u2019s curiosity and passion that shone through in the original animation, creating a unique version of the beloved character.
