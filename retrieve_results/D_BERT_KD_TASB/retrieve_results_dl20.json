Egg yolks contain cholesterol, too.lso, even though fish contains cholesterol, you can help lower your cholesterol by eating at least two servings of fish each week in place of meat. You can do this because many types of fish are relatively low in saturated fat. The following table shows the amount of cholesterol in many common foods.",
