For prevention of rain-driven erosion, it is important to anchor the dirt down, such as with grass, or prevent water from collecting and picking up dirt as it flows down slope. A common way to prevent this is contour ploughing. What is... Making slopes into steps so that rain cannot run down a hill carrying soil off. When building terraces, it is important to stabilize the slope. -The easiest way to do this is to plant grass. If there is enough rock around it may be possible to construct a wall out of them. Contour Ploughing- Similar to terracing, except that it follows the contours of a hill more closely than terracing, possibly even encircling a hill top The contours are not wide like terraces.",

It can mean relating to the internal organs of your body (the visceral organs), or it can mean relating to deep emotional feelings that are separate from intellect.

So, if you have a visceral feeling, it means a feeling on the inside, in your internal organs; and usually this is referring to the guts (intestines). For instance, you have a gut feeling, something you feel inside you.",
