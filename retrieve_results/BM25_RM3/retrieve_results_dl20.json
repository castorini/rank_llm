A deal in which the car is sold for $12,500 would be Pareto efficient because both the seller and the buyer are better off as a result of the trade. In this case, they are better off by the same amount: $2,500. However, any price between $10,000 and $15,000 is Pareto efficient because the seller receives more value in money than the value he places on the car, and the buyer values the car more than the money he pays for it. Pareto efficiency has applications in game theory, multicriteria decisionmaking, engineering, and many of the social sciences. It is a central principle in economics. In general, an economic allocation problem has several possible Pareto efficient outcomes. In the marketplace, the competitive equilibrium is typically included among them.",

A: A quitclaim deed is a written document that transfers the title (ownership) of real property such as a home or piece of land. A quitclaim deed offers no warranties or guarantees that the owner has good title or ownership, but simply conveys whatever interest exists when the deed is executed (transferred) and delivered.

High tea is not an afternoon respite of finger sandwiches, scones, and sweets, but the main meal of the day for the working class. It originated during the Industrial Revolution for workers who returned home after a long hard day of physical labor looking forward to a hot, hearty meal. (High tea may be called high because it was the main meal of the day, as opposed to afternoon tea, which was also called low tea.) Avoid using the term high tea term for afternoon tea, or you will find yourself in the Tea Drinkers' Hall of Shame! Tea Time The traditional time for afternoon tea is any time between three and five o'clock.",

It builds its nest on the ground and lives in the grass. The female will lay between 10 and 18 eggs in the nest. Other kinds of American quail that have similar egg laying abilities are: the California quail, Gambel's quail and mountain quail. These birds have crests standing on their heads. They live in Western and Southwestern states.",

The greater part of a muscle is made up of tissues that expand and contract like rubber. At each end of every muscle is a tendon. This is a very strong tissue used to fasten the muscle to other parts of the body. It does not stretch. Often a tendon fastens a muscle to a bone. For example, the muscle at the front of the upper part of the arm, known as the biceps, is fastened by a tendon to the bones of the lower part of the arm just below the elbow.",
