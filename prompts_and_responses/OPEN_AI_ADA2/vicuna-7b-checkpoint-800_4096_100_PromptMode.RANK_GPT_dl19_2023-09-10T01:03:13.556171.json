Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: how long is life cycle of flea.\n\n[1] When the fleas fed from a host for five days, and were then removed, death occurred within 2-4 days. When the feeding time was restricted to 12 hours, the fleas didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t reach the point of dependency, and some lived as long as 14 days after being removed from the host.\n[2] Fleas can live for about 100 days during which time the females produce 400-500 offspring. Fleas transport themselves on rodents and other mammals, and usually remain on their hosts at all times. These pests use their powerful legs to jump as high as 8 vertically, which is 150 times their own height. If humans could do this, we would be able to leap over skyscrapers.\n[3] LIFE CYCLE. Unlike most fleas, adult cat fleas remain on the host where feeding, mating, and egg laying occur. Females lay about 20 to 50 eggs per day. Cat flea eggs are pearly white, oval, and about 1/32 inch long (Figure 3).\n[4] The fleas you see on your cat are adult fleas, which are only about 5 percent of the flea population in an environment. The other fleas are scattered about as eggs, larvae or pupae. Adult fleas generally live two to four weeks, although in a hospitable environment they may live up to four months.\n[5] Full Answer. Fleas survive an average of eight days on a short-haired dog, and they typically last longer on a host with longer hair. Fleas need a food source to survive and reproduce to continue their life cycle, and a healthy flea can lay around 27 eggs each day.\n[6] TICK LIFE CYCLE *. Like fleas, eggs will fall off it as it moves around which means eggs can find their way to beds, furniture and other areas of the home. The young which emerge from the eggs are quick to feed but are able to wait almost a year without food.\n[7] 1 On average, they live two to three months. 2 Female fleas cannot lay eggs until after their first blood meal and begin to lay eggs within 36-48 hours after that meal. 3 The female flea can lay 2,000 eggs in her lifetime. The female flea consumes 15 times her own body weight in blood daily.\n[8] How Long Do Fleas Live? Fleas can live as an adult for more than a year, and they can lay eggs within 30 days, as well. Find out how fleas can survive through the winter in pupae cases with help from a pest control operator in this free video on flea control and extermination. Part of the Video Series: Flea Control.\n[9] A flea can lay eggs and hatch in 21 days. Treating your pet is the best prevention. But it is also a good idea to get periodic bug treatment in your house, wash your dog bed, keep your grass cut short, vacuum your carpet, cover outdoor crawl spaces that wildlife might hide in.\n[10] Without a host for food a flea's life might be as short as a few days. With ample food supply, the adult flea will often live up to 100 days. Newly emerged adult fleas live only about one week if a blood meal is not obtained.\n[11] 1 Undisturbed and without a blood meal, a flea can live more than 100 days. 2 On average, they live two to three months. 3 Female fleas cannot lay eggs until after their first blood meal and begin to lay eggs within 36-48 hours after that meal. One flea broke a record with a four-foot vertical jump. 2 Undisturbed and without a blood meal, a flea can live more than 100 days. 3 On average, they live two to three months. 4 Female fleas cannot lay eggs until after their first blood meal and begin to lay eggs within 36-48 hours after that meal.\n[12] Lifespan/Longevity. Lifespan of these water fleas depends heavily on environmental conditions such as oxygen levels, food availability, and temperature. In general, as temperature decreases, lifespan increases, with averages of 40 days at 25\u00c2\u00b0C and 56 days at 20\u00c2\u00b0C. Unstable environmental conditions tend to lead to shorter lifespans.\n[13] The pupae stage of the flea life cycle accounts for about 10 percent of the flea population in a home. This cocoon stage is the last developmental stage before the adult flea emerges. The cocoon protects the pupae for several days or weeks before the adult flea emerges.\n[14] They can live for up to 2 years and that is not counting the baby fleas that hatch in the mean time. Those little f*er's a pain to get rid of.\n[15] It's estimated that with any flea population, 95% of all these parasites are in a sub-adult stage (i.e., eggs, larvae, or pupa). These sub-adult fleas can lie dormant in your home for several months before they hatch and start the cycle all over again. Stages of a Flea's Life.\n[16] Types of Fleas. There are thousands of types of fleas, but the most common seen in the United States is the cat flea. It has a lifespan between 30 and 75 days and four different developmental stages. Fleas feed on the blood of the host cat.\n[17] Generally speaking, an adult flea only lives for 2 or 3 months. Without a host for food a flea's life might be as short as a few days. With ample food supply, the adult flea will often live up to 100 days.Newly emerged adult fleas live only about one week if a blood meal is not obtained.enerally speaking, an adult flea only lives for 2 or 3 months. Without a host for food a flea's life might be as short as a few days. With ample food supply, the adult flea will often live up to 100 days.\n[18] Flea eggs can remain dormant for astonishingly long periods of time under a variety of conditions. They lay dormant in the garden, or in your carpet and furniture, until they are able to hitch a ride. They jump great distances to find a host and travel on pets and even on people. One flea broke a record with a four-foot vertical jump. 2 Undisturbed and without a blood meal, a flea can live more than 100 days. 3 On average, they live two to three months. 4 Female fleas cannot lay eggs until after their first blood meal and begin to lay eggs within 36-48 hours after that meal.\n[19] Cat fleas can survive solely on a diet of human blood. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re capable of living for 139 to 185 days if fed on human arms for 15 minutes each day. 10 minute feeding intervals can keep females alive for up to 30 days, and males for 17 days. In a recent study, fleas had continuous access to human blood for 12 days in an artificial setting. A significant number of fleas survived, especially when dog hair was added to their cages.\n[20] The Pet Shed Petcyclopedia explains that a flea can live for a little over 130 days when it has access to a host. When a flea loses its host, it must find a new one as quickly as possible. According to 1-800-PetMeds, a little over half of newborn fleas may be able to survive for two months without a host if their environment is humid enough.\nSearch Query: how long is life cycle of flea.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

This flea larva lives in the host's environment(it is part of the environmental stage of the fleas life cycle), where it feeds on fleadroppings (flea dirt) and dander.\n[6] Since fleas can live up to a year and a half (See: How Long do Fleas Live) and lay up to 50 eggs a day all the while, it doesn't take much imagination to see how big the problem can get in a short period of time. CC Image courtesy of Denni Schnapp on Flickr.\n[7] Once mated, the female flea may deposit up to 50 eggs per day on your dog or cat. An adult flea typically lives for several months, so just a single flea can cause a significant infestation in a short amount of time. As your pet walks around your home, many of the flea eggs fall off. Cat flea eggs are tiny, measuring a mere 1/32 inch, so they can go unnoticed in your pet's bedding, in carpets, or on upholstered furniture. Within 2 to 5 days, wormlike larvae emerge from the eggs. Lacking eyes and legs, you might think that flea larvae would have a tough time surviving in your carpet.\n[8] 1 Undisturbed and without a blood meal, a flea can live more than 100 days. On average, they live two to three months. Female fleas cannot lay eggs until after their first blood meal and begin to lay eggs within 36-48 hours after that meal.\n[9] Larvae make up about 35 percent of the flea population. If conditions are favorable, the larvae will spin cocoons in about 5-20 days after hatching from their eggs. The cocoons are the flea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pupal stage and account for about 10 percent of the flea population.\n[10] 1 Undisturbed and without a blood meal, a flea can live more than 100 days.

Approximately 90-95% of the fleas are cat fleas.\n[5] Flea larvae do not take a blood meal directly from a host, unlike adult fleas. The flea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s larval stage is completed within about 4-18 days. One of the last activities of flea larvae is to spin a silken cocoon and then enter the pupal stage.\n[6] Fleas can live up to 2 weeks without a food supply, however flea larvae can stay in their cocoon for up to a year or until they sense food outside the cocoon.

These include the right temperature, food supply, and humidity. Generally speaking, though, an adult flea only lives for 2 or 3 months. Without a host for food, a flea's life might be as short as a few days. But with ample food supply, the adult flea will often live up to 100 days. Cornell Entomology Fact Sheet on Fleas - This fact sheet provides the basics on the flea species, behavior, ecology, life history, and management.\n[8] In homes, flea larvae live for 7-11 days before pupating. In ideal environments, they can fully develop in 4-7 days. In poor conditions, it may take 28-45 days for flea larvae to mature. How quickly they develop depends upon ambient temperature, relative humidity, and food availability.\n[9] 6 weeks. In 3 weeks, one flea can pass through its entire life cycle and can lay 1000 eggs. In another 3 weeks, those eggs can hatch and lay 1,000 eggs each, so within 6 weeks, it is possible to have a million new fleas.f the temperature is 95\u00c2\u00b0F and there is 70% humidity, half of all flea eggs hatch within 36 hours. If it is only 55\u00c2\u00b0F, half of all flea eggs will hatch within 6 days.\n[10] The flea life cycle has four stages: 1 Egg: An adult female flea can lay up to 40 eggs a day. 2 Larva: When the eggs hats, larvae emerge. 3 Pupa: Once in the cocoon, the larva begins its transformation into the adult flea. Adult flea: A fully-developed flea only emerges from its cocoon when a host is available.\n[11] Fleas removed from their host will die of starvation within four days.

Adult fleas must feed on blood before they can become capable of reproduction. Flea populations are distributed with about 50% eggs, 35% larvae, 10% pupae, and 5% adults.enerally speaking, an adult flea only lives for 2 or 3 months. Without a host for food a flea's life might be as short as a few days. With ample food supply, the adult flea will often live up to 100 days.\n[2] The flea population is typically. made up of 50% eggs, 30% larvae, 15% pupae and only 5% biting adults. Completion of the life cycle from egg to adult varies from two weeks to eight months. Normally the female flea lays about 15 to 20 eggs per day up to 600 in a lifetime. Usual hosts for fleas are dogs, cats, rats, rabbits, mice, squirrels, chipmunks, raccoons, opossums, foxes, chickens, and humans.\n[3] In appearance, flea larvae can be up to \u00c2\u00bc-inch long and are white (almost see-through) and legless. Larvae make up about 35 percent of the flea population in the average household. If conditions are favorable, the larvae will spin cocoons in about 5-20 days of hatching from their eggs.This leads to the next life stage, called the cocoon or pupae stage.The pupae stage of the flea life cycle accounts for about 10 percent of the flea population in a home.f conditions are favorable, the larvae will spin cocoons in about 5-20 days of hatching from their eggs. This leads to the next life stage, called the cocoon or pupae stage. The pupae stage of the flea life cycle accounts for about 10 percent of the flea population in a home.\n[4] A female flea will begin to lay eggs within 24-48 hours of her first blood meal. She defecates blood from her host that will fall off the host along with the eggs, re-starting the life cycle. Adult fleas can live for about 4-6 weeks depending on the environment.\n[5] Before becoming adult fleas, the larvae transform into pupae within a silk-like cocoon. Pupae remain inside the cocoon for 2 to 4 weeks, sometimes longer. The cocoon is resistant to insecticides and this is why some adult fleas are seen for an extended period, even after the home and pet are treated.\n[6] 6 weeks. In 3 weeks, one flea can pass through its entire life cycle and can lay 1000 eggs. In another 3 weeks, those eggs can hatch and lay 1,000 eggs each, so within 6 weeks, it is possible to have a million new fleas.he female lays eggs 24-36 hours after her first blood meal. Fleas lay up to 50 eggs a day, which is equal to their body weight. They can lay this many eggs because they suck up 15 times their body weight in blood daily. This blood lust can continue for 3 months.\n[7] When it comes to eliminating fleas from your pet and from your home, there are some key things to consider. First, it is very important to be familiar with and understand the life cycle of the flea when you are trying to eradicate their presence completely. There are four stages in the life cycle of a flea: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Depending on the environmental temperature and humidity levels, the total life cycle will take anywhere from a couple weeks to many months. Optimal conditions for fleas are between 70-85\u00c2\u00b0F and 70 percent humidity.\n[8] In 3 weeks, one flea can pass through its entire life cycle and can lay 1000 eggs. In another 3 weeks, those eggs can hatch and lay 1,000 eggs each, so within 6 weeks, it is possible to have a million new fleas.\n[9] 6 weeks. In 3 weeks, one flea can pass through its entire life cycle and can lay 1000 eggs. In another 3 weeks, those eggs can hatch and lay 1,000 eggs each, so within 6 weeks, it is possible to have a million new fleas.n a humid environment, over 60% of newly hatched fleas can live without a host for 2 months. In a cool, dry environment, only 10% will live without an immediate host. Humidity is the key to flea survival.\n[10] A flea might live a year and a half under ideal conditions. These include the right temperature, food supply, and humidity. Generally speaking, an adult flea only lives for 2 or 3 months. Without a host for food a flea's life might be as short as a few days. With ample food supply, the adult flea will often live up to 100 days. Newly emerged adult fleas live only about one week if a blood meal is not obtained.\n[11] After about 2 days (range 2-21 days), depending on environmental conditions, the flea egg hatches torelease a first stage flea larva. This flea larva lives in the host's environment(it is part of the environmental stage of the fleas life cycle), where it feeds on fleadroppings (flea dirt) and dander.fter about 2 days (range 2-21 days), depending on environmental conditions, the flea egg hatches torelease a first stage flea larva. This flea larva lives in the host's environment(it is part of the environmental stage of the fleas life cycle), where it feeds on fleadroppings (flea dirt) and dander.\n[12] A female flea will begin laying eggs about 24 hours after enjoying her first blood meal. Fleas pass their time on their host eating, breeding and laying eggs. Usually, an adult flea will live for two or three months. Fleas are more than irritating; they can cause tapeworm as well as flea allergies in pets.\n[13] The adult cat flea can survive on the host and maintain some reproduction for 2-4 weeks under most natural conditions, but if not killed prematurely an adult flea may live as long as 4 months. For the full life cycle please see the link. Source(s): http://www.flea-info.com/about_fleas/en/...\n[14] Fleas: advice and information. Fleas: advice and information Flea facts One flea will lay up to 25 eggs per day (approximately 800 in its life) Fleas develop from egg to larvae to pupae to adults in 18-26 days (depending on temperature) Fleas can only lay eggs after taking blood from the host animal they are living on. Approximately 90-95% of the fleas are cat fleas.\n[15] Flea larvae do not take a blood meal directly from a host, unlike adult fleas. The flea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s larval stage is completed within about 4-18 days. One of the last activities of flea larvae is to spin a silken cocoon and then enter the pupal stage.\n[16] How long is the life span of a flea? A flea might live a year and a half under ideal conditions. These include the right temperature, food supply, and humidity. Generally speaking, though, an adult flea only lives for 2 or 3 months. Without a host for food, a flea's life might be as short as a few days. But with ample food supply, the adult flea will often live up to 100 days. Cornell Entomology Fact Sheet on Fleas - This fact sheet provides the basics on the flea species, behavior, ecology, life history, and management.\n[17] In homes, flea larvae live for 7-11 days before pupating. In ideal environments, they can fully develop in 4-7 days. In poor conditions, it may take 28-45 days for flea larvae to mature. How quickly they develop depends upon ambient temperature, relative humidity, and food availability.\n[18] 6 weeks. In 3 weeks, one flea can pass through its entire life cycle and can lay 1000 eggs. In another 3 weeks, those eggs can hatch and lay 1,000 eggs each, so within 6 weeks, it is possible to have a million new fleas.f the temperature is 95\u00c2\u00b0F and there is 70% humidity, half of all flea eggs hatch within 36 hours. If it is only 55\u00c2\u00b0F, half of all flea eggs will hatch within 6 days.\n[19] The flea life cycle has four stages: 1 Egg: An adult female flea can lay up to 40 eggs a day. 2 Larva: When the eggs hats, larvae emerge. 3 Pupa: Once in the cocoon, the larva begins its transformation into the adult flea. Adult flea: A fully-developed flea only emerges from its cocoon when a host is available.\n[20] Fleas removed from their host will die of starvation within four days. Young fleas that haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fed can live slightly longer without a blood meal, around one week. Pre-emerged adults, remaining inside their cocoons, can enter into a dormant-like state. They can survive for up to 155 days without feeding.\nSearch Query: how long is life cycle of flea.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Newly emerged flea larvae can survive two weeks without a blood meal, and pre-emerged fleas (pupae/cocoon stage) can survive six months without feeding.\n[2] Flea eggs hatch into larvae within one to 12 days. Larvae. Flea larvae are approximately 3 to 5.2 mm long and are semitransparent white in color. The larval stage lasts from four to 18 days, after which larvae spin silken cocoons and enter the pupal stage.

Without a host for food, a flea's life might be as short as a few days.\n[9] The Flea Life Cycle. Fleas undergo complete metamorphosis with four stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Environmental variables influence the length of each developmental stage. Fleas prefer a warm, humid environment, with temperatures ranging between 70\u00c2\u00b0 and 90\u00c2\u00b0 Fahrenheit and a relative humidity of 75% or more.\n[10] Completely developed adult fleas can live for several months without eating, as long as they do not emerge from their cacoons. Newly emerged adult fleas live only about one week if a blood meal is not obtained. Optimum temperatures for the flea's life cycle are 70\u00c2\u00b0F to 85\u00c2\u00b0F and optimum humidity is 70 percent.

Usual hosts for fleas are dogs, cats, rats, rabbits, mice, squirrels, chipmunks, raccoons, opossums, foxes, chickens, and humans.\n[9] The flea life cycle. Adult fleas spend most of their time on your dog or cat. They can live up to two years and a female will start laying eggs within two days of finding a host. The eggs that are laid by females fall off the cat or dog into the environment along with \u00e2\u0080\u0098flea dirts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (flea excrement).\n[10] Fleas have four life stages, lasting weeks or months, depending on the environment. An adult flea can live up to two weeks without a host. Fleas have four life stages, lasting weeks or months, depending on the environment.\n[11] Fleas pass through a complete life cycle of four stages. 30% larvae, 15% pupae and only 5% biting adults. Completion of the life cycle from egg to adult varies from two weeks to eight months. Normally the female flea lays about 15 to 20 eggs per day up to 600 in a lifetime.\n[12] Fleas have four main stages in their life cycle: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. The total flea life cycle can range from a couple weeks to several months, depending on environmental conditions. The adult flea is very flat side to side.\n[13] Once the flea reaches adulthood, its primary goal is to find blood and then to reproduce. Its total life span can be as long one and one-half years in ideal conditions. Female fleas can lay 5000 or more eggs over their life, allowing for phenomenal growth rates. Average 30\u00e2\u0080\u009390 days.\n[14] How long is the life span of a flea? 30-90 Days (Average). A flea might live a year and a half under ideal conditions. These include the right temperature, food supply, and humidity. Generally speaking, though, an adult flea only lives for 2 or 3 months. Without a host for food, a flea's life might be as short as a few days.\n[15] The whole cycle can be as quick as 20 days or can last up to one full year; this is because the flea may be in a dormant stage for a long time. The cycle can be interrupted at any stage, but some flea control methods are more effective than others depending upon the stage the flea is in.\n[16] How long is the life span of a flea? 30-90 Days (Average). A flea might live a year and a half under ideal conditions. These include the right temperature, food supply, and humidity. Generally speaking, though, an adult flea only lives for 2 or 3 months. Without a host for food, a flea's life might be as short as a few days. But with ample food supply, the adult flea will often live up to 100 days.\n[17] 1 Fleas pass through a complete life cycle of four stages. made up of 50% eggs, 30% larvae, 15% pupae and only 5% biting adults. Completion of the life cycle from egg to adult varies from two weeks to eight months.\n[18] When you initiated treatment, it can be assumed that eggs were laid earlier that day. It takes around 2 days for those eggs to hatch, 7 days for the larvae to pupate, and another 7 days until the adult stage is reached. In homes, you can expect the full life cycle to complete in 17 to 26 days. While no new fleas should be able to successfully develop past 26 days, one life stage is a problem.\n[19] They eat the feces of adult fleas (which is mostly dried blood) and other organic debris found in the carpet, bedding, and soil. Depending on the amount of food present and the environmental conditions, the larval stage lasts about 5 to 18 days (longer in some cases) then the larva spins a silken cocoon and pupates.\n[20] 6 weeks. In 3 weeks, one flea can pass through its entire life cycle and can lay 1000 eggs. In another 3 weeks, those eggs can hatch and lay 1,000 eggs each, so within 6 weeks, it is possible to have a million new fleas.\nSearch Query: how long is life cycle of flea.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

ADULT: The adult flea is very flat side to side. There are hair-like bristles on the flea body and legs to aid in their navigation through pet hair.\n[2] The life cycle of a flea can last anywhere from 20 days to an entire year. It depends on how long the flea remains in the dormant stage (eggs, larvae, pupa). Outside influences, such as weather, affect the flea cycle. A female flea can lay around 20 to 25 eggs in one day.\n[3] The life cycle of a flea can last anywhere from 20 days to an entire year. It depends on how long the flea remains in the dormant stage (eggs, larvae, pupa). Outside influences, such as weather, affect the flea cycle. A female flea can lay around 20 to 25 eggs in one day. The flea egg stage is the beginning of the flea cycle. This part of the flea cycle represents a little more than one third of the flea population at any given time. Depending on the temperature and humidity of the environment the egg can take from two to six days to hatch.\n[4] Life Cycle (Back to Top). The cat flea life cycle is one of complete metamorphosis, involving the stages of an egg, larva, pupa, and adult. This cycle usually lasts 30 to 75 days, yet may vary due to external factors, such as temperature and humidity.\n[5] Stickfast flea life history. The complete life cycle of the flea takes about four weeks, varying according to the temperature. The female fleas lay at night while attached to the bird, and the very small eggs fall to the ground. In about four days, small wormlike larvae emerge from the eggs. The larvae feed on organic material, mainly the dried blood excreted by the adult fleas, and shelter in the surface dust and litter on the soil. After several moults, they grow to about 3 mm, cease to feed and burrow down into the soil to a depth of about 15 cm.\n[6] There are four stages in a flea's life: egg, larva (maggoty-like-thing), pupa (in a cocoon) and adult. Egg-to-egg life cycle is usually two to four weeks. Under the right conditions this can be a little shorter (12 days), or much longer (8 months).\n[7] Stickfast flea life history. The complete life cycle of the flea takes about four weeks, varying according to the temperature. The female fleas lay at night while attached to the bird, and the very small eggs fall to the ground. In about four days, small wormlike larvae emerge from the eggs. The larvae feed on organic material, mainly the dried blood excreted by the adult fleas, and shelter in the surface dust and litter on the soil.\n[8] Under ideal conditions, the cat flea life cycle takes just 18 days, from egg to adult. Adult fleas (both male and female) require a blood meal prior to mating. They prefer blood from your pet, but in the absence of a canine or feline host, fleas will bite people.\n[9] The time it takes to complete the life cycle from egg to adult varies from two weeks to eight months, depending on the temperature, humidity and the amount of food available. A typical flea population consists of 50 per cent eggs, 35 per cent larvae, ten per cent pupae and only five per cent adults.\n[10] When it comes to eliminating fleas from your pet and from your home, there are some key things to consider. One of the most important things is life cycle of the flea, which depending on the environmental temperature and humidity levels can take between a couple of week to many months. There are four stages in the life cycle of a flea: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Here we will discuss all four\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.\n[11] Completion of the life cycle from egg to adult varies from two weeks to eight months. Normally the female flea lays about 15 to 20 eggs per day up to 600 in a lifetime. Usual hosts for fleas are dogs, cats, rats, rabbits, mice, squirrels, chipmunks, raccoons, opossums, foxes, chickens, and humans.\n[12] The life cycle depends on the humidity and temperature of your house: The eggs hatch in 1-6 days. They will be in the carpet, the furniture and are in highest numbers where she spends most of her time. The eggs hatch to become larvae. They molt and have 3 stages. The total time for this stage is 6-36 days. The pupae is a cocoon that the larvae goes into. The cocoon takes about 7-10 days to develop but then can be dormant for a long time until a host enters the situation (such as a cat). The adult flea is really only on the pet for about 2 weeks. The rest of the time is spent off the pet.\n[13] The flea life cycle has four stages: Egg: An adult female flea can lay up to 40 eggs a day. The eggs are laid on the host \u00e2\u0080\u008bbut will dry and fall off that host into the environment (pet bedding, carpet, etc). Eggs typically hatch within about two days.\n[14] 1 Completion of the life cycle from egg to adult varies from two weeks to eight months. Normally the female flea lays about 15 to 20 eggs per day up to 600 in a lifetime.\n[15] The cat flea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life cycle is one of complete metamorphosis: an egg stage, larval (grub) stage, pupal (cocoon) stage and adult stage. The cat flea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life cycle usually lasts from about 1 to 2 \u00c2\u00bd months and depends on the temperature and humidity of their habitat. Adults are the only stage that lives on the host, and the female adult cat flea must have a fresh blood meal in order to produce a new batch of eggs.\n[16] There are four stages in the life cycle of a flea: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Depending on the environmental temperature and humidity levels, the total life cycle will take anywhere from a couple weeks to many months. Optimal conditions for fleas are between 70-85\u00c2\u00b0F and 70 percent humidity.\n[17] The lifecycle of a flea. 5% of fleas live in the environment as an adult, 95 % of fleas live as eggs, larvae or pupae.

Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: definition declaratory judgment.\n\n[1] A declaratory judgment, also called a declaration, is the legal determination of a court that resolves legal uncertainty for the litigants.\n[2] A declaratory judgment is one which simply declares the rights of the parties, or expresser, the opinion of the court on a. question of law, without ordering anything to be done.\n[3] Declaratory judgments are judgment of a court in a civil case that declares the rights, duties, or obligations of each party in a dispute. However, a declaratory judgment does not order any action or result in any award of damages to any party to the case.\n[4] A declaratory judgment, sometimes called declaratory relief, is conclusive and legally binding as to the present and future rights of the parties involved. The parties involved in a declaratory judgment may not later seek another court resolution of the same legal issue unless they appeal the judgment.\n[5] Wiktionary (0.00 / 0 votes) Rate this definition: declaratory judgment (Noun). A ruling of a court in a civil case which declares the rights, duties, or obligations of each party in a dispute, but does not necessarily award any damages or other relief.\n[6] A ruling by a court (or, less commonly, a regulator) that resolves a dispute but does not order an action. That is, a declaratory judgment states a fact. For example, a declaratory judgment may state who owns a patent or a piece of property.\n[7] Instead, the judge, after analyzing the controversy, simply issues an opinion declaring the rights of each of the parties involved. A declaratory judgment may only be granted in justiciable controversies\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, in actual, rather than hypothetical, controversies that fall within a court's jurisdiction.\n[8] A declaratory judgment does not provide for any enforcement, however. In other words, it states the court's authoritative opinion regarding the exact nature of the legal matter without requiring the parties to do anything.\n[9] The declaratory judgment is generally considered a statutory remedy and not an equitable remedy in the United States, and is thus not subject to equitable requirements, though there are analogies that can be found in the remedies granted by courts of equity.\n[10] An action or proceeding is not open to objection on the ground that a declaratory judgment or decree is prayed for. (b) The declaration may be either affirmative or negative in form and effect, and the declaration has the force and effect of a final judgment or decree.\n[11] The unique feature of the Declaratory Judgment Act is its authorization to \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeclare\u00e2\u0080\u009d the rights and legal relations of the parties to the controversy; such declarations have the force and effect of a final judgment.\n[12] An insurance company, for example, might seek a declaratory judgment as to whether a policy applies to a certain person or event. Declaratory judgments also commonly involve individuals or parties who seek to determine their rights under specific regulatory or criminal laws.\n[13] 9.3 Declaratory Judgment Act. The Declaratory Judgment Act offers a unique mechanism by which advocates may seek to remedy ongoing violations of statutory or constitutional provisions. The Act may authorize broad-based declaratory and injunctive relief without resort to class action procedures.\n[14] Nolo's Plain-English Law Dictionary. A court decision in a civil case that tells the parties what their rights and responsibilities are, without awarding damages or ordering them to do anything. Courts are usually reluctant to hear declaratory judgment cases, preferring to wait until there has been a measurable loss. But especially in cases involving important constitutional rights, courts will step in to clarify the legal landscape.\n[15] \u00e2\u0080\u009cCase or Controversy\u00e2\u0080\u009d and Jurisdictional Requirements. A party seeking declaratory relief under the statute must present an \u00e2\u0080\u009cactual controversy\u00e2\u0080\u009d in order to satisfy the \u00e2\u0080\u009ccase or controversy\u00e2\u0080\u009d requirement of Article III. The Declaratory Judgment Act was not intended as a device for rendering mere advisory opinions. The case must involve a controversy that is substantial and concrete, must touch the legal relations of parties with adverse interests, and must be subject to specific relief through a decree of conclusive character.\n[16] Declaratory remedies are sought when a plaintiff wishes to be made aware of what the law is, what it means, or whether or not it is constitutional, so that he or she will be able to take appropriate action. The main purpose of this kind of remedy is to determine an individual's rights in a particular situation.\n[17] Pursuant to G.L. 1956 \u00c2\u00a7 9-30-1, Rhode Island\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enactment of the Uniform Declaratory.

Cases Finding Declaratory Judgment Jurisdiction. A patent owner wrote to its licensee alleging that a product sold by the licensee was subject to. a license agreement. The licensee paid the requested royalties under protest and filed a. declaratory judgment suit.\n[20] The Court also observed that \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeclaratory judgment jurisdiction will not arise merely on the. basis that a party learns of the existence of a patent owned by another or even perceives such a. patent to pose a risk of infringement, without some affirmative act by the patentee.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Id. at. 1381.\nSearch Query: definition declaratory judgment.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

I heard that bluetooth and wifi work the same way. Just want to know if it will apply to this or not. WiFi LAN communication protocol is completely different and is used when high speeds are required and communication distances are much further.\n[9] General Answers: Q: What is Bluetooth? A: Bluetooth is the name for a short-range radio frequency (RF) technology that operates at 2.4 GHz and is capable of transmitting voice and data. The effective range of Bluetooth devices is 32 feet (10 meters). Bluetooth transfers data at the rate of 1 Mbps, which is from three to eight times the average speed of parallel and serial ports, respectively.\n[10] Bluetooth\u00c2\u00ae. Bluetooth is a short-range wireless technology you can use to connect a device to other nearby Bluetooth-capable devices and accessories, such as headsets, speakers, printers, etc.airing is a special process used when two devices connect for the first time. The pairing process is used to generate a link key that is used for authentication purposes during subsequent Bluetooth connections between the two devices.\n[11] Bluetooth can connect up to eight devices simultaneously. With all of those devices in the same 10-meter (32-foot) radius, you might think they'd interfere with one another, but it's unlikely. Bluetooth uses a technique called spread-spectrum frequency hopping that makes it rare for more than one device to be transmitting on the same frequency at the same time.\n[12] Bluetooth radiation is emitted from all Bluetooth Headsets and Technologies and is a type of wireless radio wave frequency (RF) also known as microwave radiation. Microwave frequencies have a short wavelength and a rapid rate of oscillation.\n[13] Bluetooth is a technology that allows devices to communicate with each other without cables or wires. It is an electronics standard, which means that manufacturers that want to include this feature have to incorporate specific requirements into their electronic devices.These specifications ensure that the devices can recognize and interact with other devices that use the Bluetooth technology.hese devices include mobile phones, computers, and personal digital assistants (PDAs). The Bluetooth technology relies on short-range radio frequency, and any device that incorporates the technology can communicate as long as it is within the required distance.\n[14] Bluetooth is a telecommunications industry specification that describes how mobile devices, computers and other devices can easily communicate with each other using a short-range wireless connection. Download this free guide.\n[15] March 31, 2015. Bluetooth is a low-power, wireless standard that allows for many Bluetooth-enabled devices to communicate at short ranges. These devices include cell phones, MP3 players, printers and digital cameras, to name a few.\n[16] Bluetooth 4.0 is designed to be more intelligent (hence: Bluetooth Smart) about managing those connections, especially when it comes to conserving energy.

If power consumption is a concern, Bluetooth is probably the way to go, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re willing to configure it.\n[5] No brainer here. Wi-Fi Direct offers speeds of up to 250Mbps while Bluetooth 4.0 lags behind at a paltry-seeming 25Mbps. While I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m somewhat skeptical that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll come close to the touted maximum speed, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no doubt it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s significantly faster than the current Bluetooth High Speed standard.\n[6] Both specifications tout security as one of their main benefits. Bluetooth 4.0 uses AES 128-bit encryption to protect your data as it is transmitted between devices. Wi-Fi Direct, on the other hand, uses WPA2 security, and its AES 256-bit encryption. The winner is clear, but it should be stated that even Bluetooth 4.0 is remarkably secure.\n[7] Bluetooth 4.0 is using AES 128-bit encryption, while Wi-Fi Direct relies on WPA2 security, which uses AES 256-bit encryption. Both forms use key-based encryption and authentication methods, and both offer enough security for the average consumer.\n[8] Bluetooth is another wireless technology you're probably familiar with. You can connect your devices--laptop, phone, printer, hands-free headsets, and smart devices (such as smart bathroom scales)--that are in close proximity to each other to transmit data and let your devices communicate without wires.\n[9] Both specifications tout security as one of their main benefits. Bluetooth 4.0 uses AES 128-bit encryption to protect your data as it is transmitted between devices. Wi-Fi Direct, on the other hand, uses WPA2 security, and its AES 256-bit encryption.\n[10] Bluetooth 4.0, on the other hand, is said to have a range of at least 200 feet and it transfers data faster than NFC. NFC and Bluetooth are both ways to wirelessly connect devices.\n[11] WiFi has a greater range than Bluetooth \u00e2\u0080\u0093 perhaps as much as 120 feet indoors, but the actual range may be less. With some planning, WiFi can cover an entire house. One way to assure maximum coverage is to locate the WiFi router in the center of a house, or where its coverage is most useful.\n[12] ZigBee is more economical than Wi-Fi while Bluetooth protocol also consumes more energy and has a greater scattering of parameters of conventionally compatible units. This is caused by the fact that Bluetooth does not have a unified data transfer standard.\n[13] IEEE 802.11 working group standards like 802.11h and 802.11j are extensions or offshoots of Wi-Fi technology that each serve a very specific purpose. Bluetooth is an alternative wireless network technology that followed a different development path than the 802.11 family.\n[14] Bluetooth is a short-range wireless technology you can use to connect devices together. For example, you can use Bluetooth to make handsfree calls on a headset or in your car, listen to music on wireless speakers, use a wireless mouse or keyboard, or print a document in another room.\n[15] Bluetooth is a wireless technology for creating personal networks operating in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed band, with a range of 10 meters. Networks are usually formed ad-hoc from portable devices such as cellular phones, handhelds, and laptops.\n[16] Bluetooth is a wireless connectivity feature that has a short range and low power consumption. This makes it the perfect medium for sending information between devices in the same room. Using Bluetooth, you'll be able to connect to a wireless headset and entertainment devices like wireless speakers.\n[17] Bluetooth is a popular method of wirelessly transferring data between two devices such as your phone and your headphones, your media player and a speaker, or your iPad and a keyboard.\n[18] Photo: Cables can be a real nuisance\u00e2\u0080\u0094that's the problem wireless technologies such as Bluetooth can help to solve. Bluetooth is a similar radio-wave technology, but it's mainly designed for communicating over short distances less than about 10m or 30ft.\n[19] Bluetooth is a short-range wireless technology used to create PANs (Personal Area Networks) among your devices, and with other nearby devices. Bluetooth allows you to leave your phone in your pocket, while talking on your phone with a Bluetooth headset - with no wires. You can also exchange contact or scheduling information with other Bluetooth-enabled phones nearby, or send such information to a nearby Bluetooth-enabled printer.\n[20] Bluetooth is wireless communication standard which allows electronic devices to connect and interact with each other. It can be found in a number of gadgets, from smartphones, to loudspeakers, to laptops and more.\nSearch Query: what is wifi vs bluetooth.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: what is wifi vs bluetooth.\n\n[1] Takeaway: Bluetooth and Wi-Fi: Find out what separates these two wireless technologies. Source: Flickr/Dana Spiegel. Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are both methods that provide wireless communication, but the difference between the two mainly stems from what they are designed to do and how they are used. The main difference is that Bluetooth is primarily used to connect devices without using cables, while Wi-Fi provides high-speed access to the internet. Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard that is used to exchange data over short distances (less than 30 feet), usually between personal mobile devices.\n[2] Bluetooth and WiFi are different standards for wireless communication. Bluetooth technology is useful when transferring information between two or more devices that are near each other when speed is not an issue, such as telephones, printers, modems and headsets.\n[3] Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are to some extent complementary in their applications and usage. Wi-Fi is usually access point-centered, with an asymmetrical client-server connection with all traffic routed through the access point, while Bluetooth is usually symmetrical, between two Bluetooth devices.\n[4] The choice of Bluetooth or WiFi is clear. Bluetooth is a universal standard and easy to use. But, its range is quite limited and sound quality is restricted. WiFi systems have a wider range and can offer excellent fidelity. But, different systems that use WiFi are incompatible, and setup may be difficult.\n[5] Stockbyte/Stockbyte/Getty Images. Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are both wireless networking technologies. They transmit information via radio signals broadcast through the air rather than over wires, allowing devices to communicate with each other and share information.\n[6] Bluetooth 4.0 vs. Wi-Fi Direct: Speed. Wi-Fi Direct promises device-to-device transfer speeds of up to 250Mbps, while Bluetooth 4.0 promises speeds similar to Bluetooth 3.0 of up to 25Mbps. Both Bluetooth 4.0 and Wi-Fi Direct use the 802.11 networking standard to reach their maximum speeds.\n[7] Bluetooth 4.0 vs. Wi-Fi Direct: Speed Wi-Fi Direct promises device-to-device transfer speeds of up to 250Mbps, while Bluetooth 4.0 promises speeds similar to Bluetooth 3.0 of up to 25Mbps. Both Bluetooth 4.0 and Wi-Fi Direct use the 802.11 networking standard to reach their maximum speeds.\n[8] Bluetooth vs. WiFi - Range: Maximum range for Bluetooth based wireless connections is 30m while for Wi-Fi, it can extend well upto 100m. In Wi-Fi, range depends on the version of Wi-Fi protocol applied and addition of antennas in the communication system while no such concerns of range or extra antenna are much known in Bluetooth. . Bluetooth vs. WiFi - Devices Connected: In Bluetooth, upto 7 devices can be connected to each other (piconet) while in Wi-Fi, the maximum connections depend on Wi-Fi router which can accommodate 1 to several communicating devices at a time.\n[9] Bluetooth or Wi-Fi: what's the difference? Here's the biggest difference: With Bluetooth, you stream music from your phone to a speaker. A Wi-Fi speaker accesses music from the internet, or from a computer on your home network. You can control a Wi-Fi speaker with your smartphone. You just have to stay within range of your Wi-Fi router's signal.\n[10] Wi-Fi is used for creating wireless local area networks, linking devices within about 100 meters of a central wireless access point. Bluetooth has a much smaller range and is used to create personal area networks of devices that are within about 10 meters of each other.\n[11] Bluetooth and Wi-Fi (the brand name for products using IEEE 802.11 standards) have some similar applications: setting up networks, printing, or transferring files. Wi-Fi is intended as a replacement for high speed cabling for general local area network access in work areas.\n[12] Best Answer: Radio.Bluetooth is a high-speed, low-power microwave wireless link technology, designed to connect phones, laptops, PDAs and other portable equipment together with little or no work by the user. Unlike infra-red, Bluetooth does not require line-of-sight positioning of connected units.\n[13] Bluetooth is a wireless technology developed by Ericsson that is designed to be a cable replacement. It operates on the 2.4GHz frequency band, like WiFi, and is officially known as IEEE standard 802.15.1.\n[14] Also like WiFi, Bluetooth is \u00e2\u0080\u009cfairly\u00e2\u0080\u009d secure. Unlike WiFi, tethering via Bluetooth isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t all that common.

Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: hydrogen is a liquid below what temperature.\n\n[1] The low temperature process is the second stage in the process, and is designed to take advantage of higher hydrogen equilibrium at low temperatures. The reaction is carried out between 200 \u00c2\u00b0C and 250 \u00c2\u00b0C, and the most commonly used catalyst is based on copper.\n[2] Of course, you can do low-temperature physics experiments on Earth if you want to ,say, study particle behaviour at the atomic level \u00e2\u0080\u0093 liquid-helium coolant sends temperatures below 4K (\u00e2\u0080\u0093269C/\u00e2\u0080\u0093452F) in the lab, and some experiments have come to within just a few billionths of a kelvin of absolute zero.\n[3] Generally the science of cryogenics is when the temperature goes below that which we can reach with conventional refrigeration equipment, around 250 degrees (Fahrenheit) below zero. Many gases are liquid at these low temperatures. They can be colder, but the following list is the temperature at which these gases boil. Before their temperature can get any higher all the liquid must boil away and turn back into a gas. On Earth, none of these gases naturally exist as a liquid.\n[4] It is commonly thought of as the lowest temperature possible, but it is not the lowest enthalpy state possible, because all real substances begin to depart from the ideal gas when cooled as they approach the change of state to liquid, and then to solid; and the sum of the enthalpy of vaporization (gas to liquid) and enthalpy of fusion (liquid to solid) exceeds the ideal gas's change in enthalpy to absolute zero.\n[5] The atoms in a liquid have more energy than the atoms in a solid. There is a special temperature for every substance called the melting point. When a solid reaches the temperature of its melting point, it can become a liquid. For water, the temperature needs to be a little over zero degrees Celsius (0 o C) for you to melt.\n[6] Best Answer: Water molecules can change their status from liquid to gas (evaporation) at any temperature over 0 Celsius degrees. Water molecules can change their status from solid to gas (sublimation) at any temperature below 0 Celsius degrees. At sea level water boils 212 Fahrenheit or 100 celsius. When water boils, all its molecules change their status from liquid to gas.\n[7] Here are some relevant facts. 1 Hydrogen is the lightest of the elements with an atomic weight of 1.0. Liquid hydrogen has a density of 0.07 grams per cubic centimeter, whereas water has a density of 1.0 g/cc and gasoline about 0.75 g/cc. 2 When hydrogen is burned in air the main product is water.\n[8] Hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless gas. Its density is the lowest of any chemical element, 0.08999 grams per liter. By comparison, a liter of air weighs 1.29 grams, 14 times as much as a liter of hydrogen.very molecule of water (H 2 O) contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Hydrogen is also found in many rocks and minerals. Its abundance is estimated to be about 1,500 parts per million. That makes hydrogen the tenth most abundant element in the Earth's crust.\n[9] hcp crystal melting to He-II superfluid at 25.00 atm: 1.463 K \u00e2\u0088\u0092271.687 \u00c2\u00b0C \u00e2\u0088\u0092457.037 \u00c2\u00b0F: triple point hcp\u00e2\u0088\u0092bcc\u00e2\u0088\u0092He-II at 26.036 atm: 1.762 K \u00e2\u0088\u0092271.388 \u00c2\u00b0C \u00e2\u0088\u0092456.498 \u00c2\u00b0F: triple point hcp\u00e2\u0088\u0092bcc\u00e2\u0088\u0092He-II at 29.725 atm: 1.772 K \u00e2\u0088\u0092271.378 \u00c2\u00b0C \u00e2\u0088\u0092456.480 \u00c2\u00b0F: triple point hcp\u00e2\u0088\u0092He-II\u00e2\u0088\u0092He-I at 30.016 atm: WEL: 0.95 K \u00e2\u0088\u0092272.2 \u00c2\u00b0C \u00e2\u0088\u0092458 \u00c2\u00b0F: LNG \u00e2\u0088\u0092272.15 \u00c2\u00b0C\n[10] There are two elements that are liquid in room temperature. Bromine (Br) melts at 265.9 K. Mercury (Hg) melts at 234.32 K - This is very interesting because all of Mercury's neighboring elements are solids at room temperature. Mercury is also much less reactive than Cadmium and Zinc which are directly above Mercury.\n[11] For temperature above 0 Kelvin and 273.15 Kelvin (0 Celsius) or below then water condensing from the atmosphere would form ice. For temperature between 0 Celsius and 100 Celsius liquid water would condense. Above 100 Celsius water wouldn't condense unless the gas phase of the system was under pressure.\n[12] Two elements are liquid at room temperature (298 K): Bromine (Br), an reddish brown liquid witha suffocating odor, melts at 265.9 K. Mercury (Hg), a toxic metal, melts at 234.32 K. (See Why is mercury a liquid at STP?) Four elements melt just a few degrees above room temperature. Francium (Fr) , a radioactive and extremely reactive metal, melts around 300 K. The false color image at left shows 10,000 francium atoms in a laser trap.\n[13] Nascent Hydrogen. The hydrogen gas, which is just liberated as a result of a chemical is called nascent hydrogen or newly born hydrogen. It is obtained by passing dihydrogen gas at atmospheric pressure through an electric arc between two tungsten rods. The electric arc maintains a temperature around 4000 - 4500\u00c2\u00b0C.\n[14] The lowest layer is made up of water clouds, and mean temperatures here are at the freezing point of water \u00e2\u0080\u0093 zero degrees Celsius. At the core, however, temperatures can reach as high as 11,700\u00c2\u00b0 C. Scientists believe that its great internal heat is due to the sinking of helium from the upper atmosphere through the liquid hydrogen at the interior.\n[15] For example, the element mercury is liquid in the temperature range of -38.9&#176 C to 356.7&#176 C (we'll discuss the Celsius &#176 C scale later). As a liquid, mercury expands as it gets warmer, its expansion rate is linear and can be accurately calibrated.\n[16] This is similar to what happens on a pad while the vehicle is waiting its launch, but there is no possibility to refill the tank. STS external tank with gaseous oxygen evaporation under beanie cap. (source: Nasa) LH2 has a boiling temperature of -183\u00c2\u00b0C, this is indeed a cryogenic fuel.\n[17] The bulk of Jupiter is fluid hydrogen in two forms or phases, liquid molecular hydrogen on top and liquid metallic hydrogen below; the latter phase exists where the pressure is high enough, say 3-4 million atmospheres.\n[18] Below the lambda point, however, helium does not boil, and it expands as the temperature is lowered further. Helium I has a gas-like index of refraction of 1.026 which makes its surface so hard to see that floats of Styrofoam are often used to show where the surface is.\n[19] Other physicists have now observed quite similar liquid behavior in trapped atom samples at temperatures near absolute zero, ten million trillion times colder than the quark-gluon plasma we create at RHIC, Vigdor said. RHIC may not hold onto its hot record for long.\n[20] water freezes into a solid at 32 degrees Fahrenheit and boils into a gas at 212 degrees Fahrenheit. anywhere in between, water is a liquid. water freezes into a solid at 32 degrees Fahrenheit and boils into a gas at 212 degrees Fahrenheit.\nSearch Query: hydrogen is a liquid below what temperature.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

At room temperature hydrogen is a clear gas. Hydrogen gas (H 2) is a molecule made of two hydrogen atoms bonded together.\n[2] Is helium a solid liquid or gas? It is a gas. Answer: Helium can be in any state (solid,liquid or gas) depending on its pressure and temperature. At 2.5 MPa: Below -272.20oC it is a solidAbove -268.93oC it \u00e2\u0080\u00a6is a gasBetween these two temperatures it is a liquid (MORE) 7 people found this useful.\n[3] Helium smooshing is harder, and it can only occur under conditions of higher energy-higher temperatures. The threshold temperature of hydrogen fusion (sometimes called a proton-proton reaction) is on the order of 10,000,000 K to 14,000,000 K or 10 to 14 million degrees Kelvin.Blazing hot! But the threshold temperature for helium fusion is on the order of 100,000,000 K or 100 million degrees Kelvin! Wow! The threshold temperature of hydrogen fusion (sometimes called a proton-proton reaction) is on the order of 10,000,000 K to 14,000,000 K or 10 to 14 million degrees Kelvin. Blazing hot! But the threshold temperature for helium fusion is on the order of 100,000,000 K or 100 million degrees Kelvin! Wow!\n[4] ~he temperature of the liquid cryogen (~nd the sample) maythen be reduced below the normal boiling point, by reducingthe pressure on top of the liquid. Using a typical 27 cfmroughing pump can usually reduce the temperature of a heliumreservoir to below 2 K (at a pressure of 24 torr or less).2.\n[5] Hydrogen bonding contributes to many of the physical and chemical properties, such as the unusual but normally known freezing point of 273.15 K, and 373.15 K respectively. The critical temperature and pressure are 647.3 K and 220.5 bar (22050 kPa) and critical volume = 0.056 m3 kmol-1. Because of the many applications of water, some more details on the properties of water are desirable. Thus, keeping track of water properties is of national interest.\n[6] Water is 100 C. A liquid becomes a gas when the heat no longer raises the temperature but uses the heat energy to break apart in \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 termolecular forces. So basically there is no single answer for all liquids. However, the name of the temperature is the boiling point.nder normal atmospheric pressure oxygen is a liquid at temperatures ranging from -218.79 degrees Celsius to -182.96 degrees Celsius. This works out to -361.82 degrees Fah \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 renheit to -297.33 degrees Fahrenheit. 2 people found this useful.\n[7] Name: Hydrogen Symbol: H Atomic Number: 1 Atomic Mass: 1.00794 amu Melting Point:-259.14 \u00c2\u00b0C (14.009985 K, -434.45203 \u00c2\u00b0F) Boiling Point:-252.87 \u00c2\u00b0C (20.280005 K, -423.166 \u00c2\u00b0F) Number of Protons/Electrons: 1 Number of Neutrons: 0 Classification: Non-metal Crystal Structure: Hexagonal Density @ 293 K: 0.08988 g/cm 3 Color: colorless Atomic Structure\n[8] Liquid Helium. Kamerlingh Onnes worked for many years to liquify the element which persisted as a gas to the lowest temperature. Using liquid air to produce liquid hydrogen and then the hydrogen to jacket the liquification apparatus, he produced about 60 cubic centimeters of liquid helium on July 10, 1908.\n[9] For example, the element mercury is liquid in the temperature range of -38.9\u00c2\u00b0 C to 356.7\u00c2\u00b0 C (we'll discuss the Celsius \u00c2\u00b0 C scale later). As a liquid, mercury expands as it gets warmer, its expansion rate is linear and can be accurately calibrated.\n[10] This is a first-order thermodynamic phase transition, which means that, as long as solid and liquid coexist, the temperature of the whole system remains very nearly equal to the melting point due to slow removal of heat when in contact with air, which is a poor heat conductor.he melting point of water at 1 atmosphere of pressure is very close to 0 \u00c2\u00b0C (32 \u00c2\u00b0F, 273.15 K), and in the presence of nucleating substances the freezing point of water is close to the melting point, but in the absence of nucleators water can super cool to \u00e2\u0088\u009240 \u00c2\u00b0C (\u00e2\u0088\u009240 \u00c2\u00b0F, 233 K) before freezing.\n[11] The low temperature process is the second stage in the process, and is designed to take advantage of higher hydrogen equilibrium at low temperatures.

At even lower temperatures, the various gases in air become solid. For example, oxygen solidifies bel \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 ow about 54 Kelvins.\n[2] We are typically used to atmospheric pressure. Therefore, we expect water to be a liquid at room temperature, to freeze to a solid below 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 deg Celsius), and to boil into the gas phase above 212 deg F (100 deg C).\n[3] Hydrogen is cold but it won't make zero.

Liquid hydrogen has a density of 0.07 grams per cubic centimeter, whereas water has a density of 1.0 g/cc and gasoline about 0.75 g/cc. These facts give hydrogen both advantages and disadvantages.\n[5] Just breaking the hydrogen bond in liquid water leaving the molecules essentially in the same position requires only about 25% of this energy; recently estimated at 6.3 kJ \u00cb\u00a3 mol-1 and only just over twice the average collision energy a If the hydrogen bond energy is determined from the excess heat capacity of the liquid over that of steam (assuming that this excess heat capacity is attributable to the breaking of the bonds) \u00ce\u0094H = 9.80 kJ \u00cb\u00a3 mol-1 .\n[6] Helium is the only cooler which is capable of reaching temperatures lower than 15 K (-434\u00c2\u00baF).

Helium I is the warmer form; helium II is the colder. The transition temperature, called the lambda point, is 2.17 K. (It varies slightly with pressure.) Helium I, the warm form, acts more or less like a conventional liquid.\n[11] Hydrogen is the absolute smallest of all elements, so small that four billion, laid end to end, could fit on the head of one pin!

The critical temperature and pressure are 647.3 K and 220.5 bar (22050 kPa) and critical volume = 0.056 m3 kmol-1. Because of the many applications of water, some more details on the properties of water are desirable. Thus, keeping track of water properties is of national interest.\n[15] Water is 100 C.

As a liquid, mercury expands as it gets warmer, its expansion rate is linear and can be accurately calibrated.\n[18] This is a first-order thermodynamic phase transition, which means that, as long as solid and liquid coexist, the temperature of the whole system remains very nearly equal to the melting point due to slow removal of heat when in contact with air, which is a poor heat conductor.he melting point of water at 1 atmosphere of pressure is very close to 0 \u00c2\u00b0C (32 \u00c2\u00b0F, 273.15 K), and in the presence of nucleating substances the freezing point of water is close to the melting point, but in the absence of nucleators water can super cool to \u00e2\u0088\u009240 \u00c2\u00b0C (\u00e2\u0088\u009240 \u00c2\u00b0F, 233 K) before freezing.\n[19] The low temperature process is the second stage in the process, and is designed to take advantage of higher hydrogen equilibrium at low temperatures.

These are the only two stable isotopes of helium.\n[2] hydrogen is flammable yes, but not very. because it is the least dense element it disperses very quickly meaning if it were to leak out of something it would disperse before it could ignite. It also burns very fast and has a higher ignition temperature than gasoline (gasoline is between 228 and 500, hydrogen is 550).\n[3] The main job of the tank is to hold about 535,000 gallons of super cold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen.

You can make water boil, however, by putting it in a vacuum! Boiling is the process of a substance changing from liquid to gas phase.or Hydrogen, the boiling point is -253 degrees Celsius; for Mercury it is 357 degrees Celsius, and for Iron it is 2,750 degrees Celsius. From these numbers you can see that at room temperature (and indeed for nearly any temperature found on Earth) Hydrogen is a gas, Mercury is a liquid, and Iron is a solid.\n[5] Hydrogen lines will be strong for temperatures = 4,000 to 12,000 K. Helium atoms hang onto their electrons more strongly and, therefore, require higher temperatures of 15,000 to 30,000 K to produce absorption lines in the visible band.\n[6] 1 The value listed above, 0.95 K, is the temperature at which helium does solidify at a pressure of 25 atmospheres. ^ 2 7 This element sublimes at one atmosphere of pressure. ^ 3 8 The transuranic elements 95 and above do not occur naturally, but some of them can be produced artificially.\n[7] For example, water at 1 atmosphere. pressure is a solid below 0oC, a liquid from 0oC to 100oC, and a gas. above 100oC.

But the water should be cooled by 540\u00c2\u00b0 to provide enough heat to evaporate completely.\n[9] At normal atmospheric pressure, liquid helium boils at at temperature of 4.2 Kelvin or -452.11 degrees Fahrenheit. It is important to have helium transfills scheduled in a timely manner to prevent the magnet from warming up and quenching.\n[10] Eventually you would reach a point where the liquid became a solid.

Thumbs up.\n[5] When helium is cooled to a critical temperature of 2.17 K (called its lambda point), a remarkable discontinuity in heat capacity occurs, the liquid density drops, and a fraction of the liquid becomes a zero viscosity superfluid.\n[6] When you combine two atoms of hydrogen with one atom of oxygen you get a water molecule H 2O.

Hydrogen has a melting point of -259.14 \u00c2\u00b0C and a boiling point of -252.87 \u00c2\u00b0C.\n[6] What is neon's state of matter? Full Answer Hydrogen's state of matter can change when the temperature changes, becoming a liquid at temperatures between minus 423.18 and minus 434.49 degrees Fahrenheit. It becomes a solid at temperatures below minus 434.49 F. Due to its high flammability, hydrogen gas is commonly used in combustion reactions, such as in rocket and automobile fuels.\n[7] 1 APPEARANCE: Hydrogen fluoride is a colorless fuming liquid below 67\u00c2\u00b0F (19.4\u00c2\u00b0C), or a colorless gas. 2 When hydrogen fluoride is combined with water it is known as hydrofluoric acid, a colorless liquid, which in low concentrations is visually indistinguishable from water.\n[8] Other molecules, as small as water (eg CO2), change from liquid to gas at temperatures far below that of water. It is also the Hydrogen bond which is responsible for the large amount of heat energy needed to convert water from liquid to gas.\n[9] Only two elements exist as liquids at a normal room temperature of 20\u00c2\u00b0C\u00e2\u0080\u009325\u00c2\u00b0C: mercury and bromine. The upper right portion of the periodic table also includes most of the elements whose binary hydrides are gases. In addition, the binary hydrides of the elements of Groups 14\u00e2\u0080\u009316 are gases.\n[10] (Not pictured.) (Photo: Wikimedia Commons). At extreme pressures, hydrogen-a gas under normal conditions-takes on a new solid form that is remarkably different from other structures known to science while also disproving a long-held theory, according to the latest research from the Carnegie Institution for Science.

Its boiling point and critical point depend on which isotope of helium is present: the common isotope helium-4 or the rare isotope helium-3. These are the only two stable isotopes of helium.\n[15] At normal atmospheric pressure, liquid helium boils at at temperature of 4.2 Kelvin or -452.11 degrees Fahrenheit. It is important to have helium transfills scheduled in a timely manner to prevent the magnet from warming up and quenching.\n[16] Interesting Facts about Hydrogen. 1 Scientists estimate that Hydrogen makes up over 90 percent of all the atoms in the universe. 2 It is the only element that can exist without neutrons. 3 Hydrogen becomes a liquid at very low temperature and high pressure.

In order to fit into a reasonably sized storage tank, hydrogen has to be somehow squeezed into a denser form.\n[2] Beneath that, where the planet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hydrogen are in a liquid state, the density rises to roughly 0.5 g/cm\u00c2\u00b3 and increases to 1 g/cm\u00c2\u00b3 at the boundary with the layer composed of metallic hydrogen. The layer metallic hydrogen, meanwhile, has an estimated density of 4 g/cm\u00c2\u00b3 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 i.e. around the same as Mars.\n[3] The density of liquid hydrogen is only 70.99 g/L (at 20 K), a relative density of just 0.07. Although the specific energy is around twice that of other fuels, this gives it a remarkably low volumetric energy density, many fold lower.\n[4] In 1908 he managed to lower the temperature to less than four degrees above absolute zero, to less than \u00e2\u0088\u0092269 \u00c2\u00b0C (4 Kelvin). Only in this exceptionally cold state will helium liquify, the boiling point of helium being at \u00e2\u0088\u0092268.94 \u00c2\u00b0C.\n[5] For Hydrogen, the boiling point is -253 degrees Celsius; for Mercury it is 357 degrees Celsius, and for Iron it is 2,750 degrees Celsius. From these numbers you can see that at room temperature (and indeed for nearly any temperature found on Earth) Hydrogen is a gas, Mercury is a liquid, and Iron is a solid.\n[6] Hydrogen occurs as a gas that you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t smell. It is about 14 times lighter than air. When you combine two atoms of hydrogen with one atom of oxygen you get a water molecule H 2O.

Hydrogen is one of the most common elements in our universe. The sun and many stars are made of hydrogen.\n[7] For example water (H 2 0) is a gas (steam) when heated above 100 C, it is a liquid at room temperature and becomes a solid (ice) when its temperature goes below 0 C, in winter for instance.\n[8] Liquid helium solidifies only under very low temperatures and great pressures. At temperatures below their liquefaction points, both helium-4 and helium-3 undergo transitions to superfluids.\n[9] The measurements show that solid hydrogen under such extreme conditions is an unusual hybrid solid, on the border of being a semiconductor, like silicon, and a semi-metal, like graphite. The results, researchers say, disprove the claims that hydrogen forms a dense atomic metal under extreme atmospheric conditions.\n[10] One of hydrogen properties is that it has a lower density. In fact, it is a lot less denser than gasoline. This means that it has to be compressed to liquid state and stored the same way at lower temperatures to guarantee its effectiveness and efficiency as an energy source.\n[11] At these pressures, hydrogen might exist as a liquid rather than solid. Liquid metallic hydrogen is thought to be present in large amounts in the gravitationally compressed interiors of Jupiter, Saturn, and in some extrasolar planets.\n[12] At high pressure and temperatures, metallic hydrogen might exist as a liquid rather than a solid, and researchers think it is present in large amounts in the hot and gravitationally compressed interiors of Jupiter, Saturn, and in some extrasolar planets.\n[13] The hydrogen gas that makes up most of the atmosphere slowly changes to liquid with depth as the pressure increases.

These are apparent in the living and working conditions that people experience every day. The SDH influence health in many positive and negative ways.he social gradient not only represents the effects of income on health but also the importance of income as a means of gaining access to other social determinants of health such as education, food, housing, recreational activities, and other societal resources.\n[12] Social determinants of health are economic and social conditions that influence the health of people and communities [1]. These conditions are shaped by the amount of money, power, and resources that people have, all of which are influenced by policy choices.hese social determinants of health also interact with and influence individual behaviors as well. More specifically, social determinants of health refer to the set of factors that contribute to the social patterning of health, disease, and illness.\n[13] Social determinants of health reflect the social factors and physical conditions of the environment in which people are born, live, learn, play, work, and age.

The social determinants of health (SDOH) are the economic and social conditions and their distribution among the population that influence individual and group differences in health status.\n[16] These social structures and economic systems include the social environment, physical environment, health services, and structural and societal factors.

Socioeconomic Gradient in Health This term refers to the stepwise fashion health outcomes improve as socioeconomic position improves.\n[18] The social determinants of health are linked to the economic and social conditions and their distribution among the population that influence individual and group differences in health status.

There's a lot of variation when it comes to estimates of how many Americans self-identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender, but a survey out this week from Gallup thinks it has the best answer yet: 3.4 percent.\n[5] In 1991, 11 percent of Americans were veterans, but the number of veterans in Congress dropped to 48 percent. And in 2001, 30 percent of members were veterans, and nine percent of Americans had served in the military. The final thing to consider is the number of active duty military personnel over the past 70 years.\n[6] About 70 percent of us earn 80 percent or more of our household's income. * About one in five of us is retired. About two-thirds of us who are working are self-employed. Interestingly, self-employed people make up less than 20 percent of the workers in America but account for two-thirds of the millionaires. Also, three out of four of us who are self-employed consider ourselves to be entrepreneurs.\n[7] The Christian share of the population has declined by a similar amount among those with less than a college education (from 81% to 73%).

Sometimes a cause is found (such as those above) and sometimes there is no obvious cause. If the source of your chronic pelvic pain can be found, treatment focuses on that cause.\n[2] Chronic pelvic pain occurs over a long period of time, either constantly or coming and going. Constant chronic pain may be caused by more than one problem in more than one area of the body. In all cases, carefully track your symptoms and speak with your doctor to help uncover the cause of your pelvic pain.\n[3] Ruptured ovarian cysts are one of the most common causes of acute pelvic pain in premenopausal women. The sonographic appearance depends on whether a simple or hemorrhagic ovarian cyst ruptures, and whether the cyst has completely collapsed. The most important differential consideration is a ruptured ectopic pregnancy.\n[4] Pelvic Inflammatory Disease. This is infection occurring in female reproductive organs and causes pain in the lower abdomen. Symptoms: Pain in the lower abdomen, pelvis; and pain in the low back, pain during intercourse, pain when urinating, vaginal discharge, weakness and fever. Investigations: Pelvic ultrasound, endometrial biopsy and laparoscopy.\n[5] Chronic pelvic pain syndromes include interstitial cystitis and irritable bowel syndrome. Although irritable bowel syndrome is marked by abdominal pain and alterations in bowel movement frequency or form, patients with this disorder may also experience urinary symptoms, including frequency, urgency and dysuria.\n[6] Many different conditions can cause chronic pelvic pain. You may have one or more of them. All can have similar symptoms, and that often makes it hard to figure out the source of the pain. The main symptom is pain that lasts for more than six months, but there are usually other symptoms, as well.ymptoms you may have: 1 Pain during your period. 2 Feeling of pressure on your bladder or rectum. 3 Heavy periods. 4 Periods that last longer than usual. 5 Spotting between periods.\n[7] Chronic pelvic pain can be intermittent or constant. Intermittent chronic pelvic pain usually has a specific cause, while constant pelvic pain may be the result of more than one problem. A common example of chronic pelvic pain is dysmenorrhea or menstrual cramps. Other causes of chronic pelvic pain include endometriosis, adenomyosis, and ovulation pain. Sometimes an illness starts with intermittent pelvic pain that becomes constant over time, this is often a signal that the problem has become worse.\n[8] Occasionally, it is caused by a ruptured appendix, tuberculosis, or diverticulitis. It can involve the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes (which link the ovaries and uterus) (figure 1). Chronic changes following pelvic inflammatory disease occur in about one-third of women and causes chronic pelvic pain.\n[9] Thus, unexplained pelvic pain is often due to adhesions. These commonly form after a surgery, infection, endometriosis or trauma. Pelvic adhesions join structures with strong glue-like bonds that can last a lifetime and can cause chronic pelvic pain.\n[10] Possible causes of pelvic pain in women only may include: 1 Ectopic pregnancy. 2 Miscarriage. 3 Pelvic inflammatory disease. 4 Ovulation. 5 Menstrual cramps. 6 Ovarian cysts or other ovarian disorders. 7 Fibroids. 8 Endometriosis.\n[11] Pain From the Urinary Tract. Urinary tract infections are more common in women than in men, presumably due to the shorter female urethra, which permits bacteria to enter the bladder more easily. The pain caused by an acute bladder infection is usually accompanied by urinary frequency, burning and urgency or pressure. Other urinary conditions that can cause chronic or recurrent pelvic pain include bladder stones, chronic urinary tract infections, bladder cancer and interstitial cystitis, which is an inflammatory disorder of the bladder wall.\n[12] Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) This female reproductive disorder is one of the most frequent causes of pelvic pain in women and is characterized by acute, persistent, or recurrent infection of the internal female reproductive organs.\n[13] 8 Common Causes of Feminine Pelvic Pain. Despite my humorous title, pelvic pain is no laughing matter. In fact, chronic pain in the nether regions has deterred women from tight pants, sexual intercourse, and even had them dredging the urge to urinate or even sit down.\n[14] Pain in the hypogastrium and pelvis. Common causes of pain in this area include rectal disease (rectal cancer, proctitis); bladder disease (stones, cystitis, bladder cancer) and more importantly in females (salpingo-oopheritis, uterine cancer).\n[15] Studies have found that nearly 30 percent of the women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population suffers from chronic pelvic pain. The chronic pelvic pain suffered by women is actually associated with a medical condition called pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS).Women who have previously given birth are slightly at risk to develop this condition.\n[16] Chronic pelvic pain is almost as difficult to diagnose because the discomfort can often indicate more than one health issue. However, being aware of the most common pelvic pain culprits\u00e2\u0080\u0094for example cysts and endometriosis\u00e2\u0080\u0094can ease worry and help catch the cause in it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s earlier stages.\n[17] Many different conditions can cause chronic pelvic pain.

Cysts may rupture during pregnancy (if a very early pregnancy, this may cause diagnostic confusion with ectopic pregnancy).\n[19] Chronic pelvic pain has many possible causes, and the symptoms may vary with what's causing the pain. Endometriosis is a condition in which the lining of the uterus (endometrium) grows outside the uterus. The lining can attach to the ovaries, fallopian tubes, intestines or other structures in the pelvis.\n[20] If you have pain below your belly button and above your legs, it counts as pelvic pain.

In some cases the pain comes from your pelvic bones that lie next to these organs, or from nearby muscles, nerves, blood vessels or joints. So, there are many causes of pelvic pain. Pelvic pain is more common in women than in men.\n[4] Recently, doctors have recognized that some pelvic pain, particularly chronic pelvic pain, can also arise from muscles and connective tissue (ligaments) in the structures of the pelvic floor. Occasionally, pelvic pain might be caused by irritation of nerves in the pelvis.\n[5] The most common gynecologic causes of pelvic pain include. 1 Menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea) 2 Pain in the middle of the menstrual cycle (mittelschmerz), occurring during ovulation. 3 Endometriosis (abnormally located patches of tissue that is normally located only in the lining of the uterus)\n[6] Symptoms of pelvic pain can occur along with other symptoms, depending upon the exact cause. Associated symptoms can include low back pain, vaginal or urethral bleeding or discharge, fever, and pain during sex.

Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: how are some sharks warm blooded.\n\n[1] Tigers, like all mammals, are considered to be warm blooded as they use endothermic methods to keep their body temperature at a near constant rate. This means that they contro\u00e2\u0080\u00a6l their temperature via internal means, such as sweating, shivering and panting. 12 people found this useful.\n[2] Basking sharks may be found in all the world's oceans, but they are more common in temperate waters. They may also migrate long distances in winter-one shark tagged off Cape Cod was recorded as far south as Brazil. More \u00c2\u00bb. Shortfin Mako Shark (Isurus oxyrinchus).\n[3] The Largest Great White Sharks. Great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) are huge and powerful warm-blooded fish that have been around for at least 11 million years. Also known as white pointers, their ancestors existed on Earth 400 million years ago, which is 200 million years before the first dinosaur appeared.\n[4] The predators are also partially endothermic, which means they can generate and retain enough heat to raise their body temperatures to high but stable levels. Most animals thought of as warm-blooded, including mammals and birds, are also both homeothermic and endothermic.\n[5] Just the thought of sharks still induces a primeval fear in many people, but of those fortunate enough to see live sharks in their own element, most cannot help but have a feeling of admiration for their beauty of movement and their supreme efficiency as predators.asking sharks and other filter feeders like the Whale shark suck water in through their mouths as they swim and purge it through their gill slits, filtering out the food in each mouthful, occupying a similar niche to the baleen whales and the Manta ray.\n[6] Brain and nervous system. In contrast to common opinion, a shark\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brain is neither extremely small, nor particularly primitive. In particular galeomorphous sharks (bull head, nurse, mackerel and ground sharks) and myliobatiformous rays have relatively large and complex brains.\n[7] About 60% of the shark species give birth to live young. This is called viviparity. In these sharks, the young remain in the mother's uterus until they are born. The viviparous shark species can be further divided into the ways the young sharks are nourished while in the mother:\n[8] \u00e2\u0080\u0098Fish are cold-blooded and breathe underwater using gills; whales, on the other hand, maintain a warm and constant body temperature.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098In genes of cold-blooded animals, plants, and unicellular organisms, these regularities are weaker and often not consistent.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n[9] Sharks have been attacking humans for over five million years. When swimming, it is an idea to put meat on your wetsuit so that it will repel them. Additionally sharks hate blood in the water, chumming the water will repel the most agressive sharks. Sharks have been evolving since the late 1700's. The shark, the killer of the deep, the dominant predator of the ocean, feared by all who see it, once was the most powerful animal in the world. The shark had long ago walked the earth as man does today.\n[10] But as far as I know, most sport fish are cold blooded. Given their cold-blooded nature, fish need to move to stay within their temperature comfort zone. Generally they do not need to move too quickly, because water has a high heat capacity, so generally change in temperature happens slowly.\n[11] Live-Bearing Sharks. About 60% of the shark species give birth to live young. This is called viviparity. In these sharks, the young remain in the mother's uterus until they are born. The viviparous shark species can be further divided into the ways the young sharks are nourished while in the mother:\n[12] The skin of the shark has to be very thick in order to assist it to retain heat and to support the muscles that are attached to its inner layers. The largest living shark, the Whale Shark, boasts skin of about 10 centimetres in thickness.\n[13] Where do sharks live? Sharks live in oceans all over the world. Most shark species prefer warmer climates and are often found in the sea around Australia, Florida and Mexico. However, other types of sharks like cold water and live in the icy waters of Alaska and Iceland. How do sharks breathe under water? Sharks are a type of fish which means they can breathe easily under water. They breathe through gills that are located on either side of their bodies. Why do sharks have so many teeth?\n[14] Animals are either cold-or warm-blooded. Cold-blooded animals' bodies are the same temperature as the air around them; warm-blooded animals' bodies maintain a regular temperature despite the air temperature. Mammals and birds are warm-blooded; snakes, lizards, other reptiles, fish and insects are cold-blooded.\n[15] The shark is a meat-eating fish and one of the most feared animals in the sea. There are over 300 types of sharks that live in oceans all over the world. Most of them live in warm seas but some sharks prefer colder regions like the seas around Antarctica. The first sharks lived in our oceans about 300 million years ago.\n[16] These species include the winghead, mallethead, scalloped hammerhead, scoophead, great hammerhead and bonnethead sharks. These sharks differ from other sharks, as they have very unique hammer-shaped heads. They inhabit tropical and warm temperate oceans around the world. More \u00c2\u00bb.\n[17] Sharks are carnivorous and may be found in all seas. They associate humans with food. Sharks do not usually live in fresh waters, but there are exceptions: the river shark and the bull shark. Most sharks are found in 2,000 meters (7,000 ft) level, in warm environments, but they can also be seen in shallow waters.\n[18] Growing up watching Jaws and fictional shark based stories, I recalled some scenes from the movie that sharks target wounded people who were swimming or in the water. I'm just really curious if they(sharks) actually are attracted to the smell of blood.\n[19] Some mammals even live in the sea such as dolphins, seals and whales. One group of mammals, the bats, can fly. er mammals, to a certain extent, and birds. However warm blood is not really the question, many reptiles have blood far warmer than ours, but only on hot days.f you meant computer worm then, computer worm is a standalone malware computer program that replicates itself in order to spread to other computers. otherwise the word worm i \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 s used to describe many different distantly related animals that typically have a long cylindrical tube-like body and no legs.\n[20] If you look a little closer, you'll see nostrils just under the shark's snout, holes that lead to an advanced inner ear system and eyes that sometimes appear to glow in the dark. In this article, we'll take a look at how the senses of smell, hearing and sight work for sharks. Go on to the next page to see if there's any truth to the story about sharks being able to smell a drop of blood from a mile away. \u00c2\u00ad\u00c2\u00ad. 1. 2. 3. 4.\nSearch Query: how are some sharks warm blooded.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Fish hearts, including the hearts of sharks, are structured differently from those of other vertebrates, however.\n[2] May 14, 2015. Researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration discovered that the opah, a deepwater predatory fish, is able to keep its body warm through a specially designed set of blood vessels in the fish's gills, which allows the fish to circulate warm blood throughout its entire body. (Science Magazine)\n[3] There are many species of sharks, over 400 in fact(and more are being found). Out of those 400+ most shark species are able to both buccal pump(pump water through their gills) and ram ventilate(swim to force water through their gills). There are some sharks that are only able to do one or the other though. Species that are primary low activity may not use ram ventilation much if at all, these species include the nurse shark and other similar sharks.\n[4] Warm and Cold Blooded Animals. With a few exceptions, all mammals and birds are warm-blooded, and all reptiles, insects, arachnids, amphibians and fish are cold-blooded.\n[5] Quick Answer. Most sharks are not physiologically capable of living in freshwater, although the bull shark is an exception. In order to live in freshwater, the body of water would need to be wide and deep enough to accommodate the shark, and it would have to be connected to the ocean for the shark to get there in the first place.

Warm-blooded animals \u00e2\u0080\u0094 mammals and birds \u00e2\u0080\u0094 have body temperatures that usually stay roughly the same, even in cold temperatures.\n[10] How do sharks smell blood in the water? they can't really see in the water. But think of it like this , let's say if you were blind folded and you were pretending that you were a shark. and you sat a plate of pizza \u00e2\u0080\u00a6on the table you can smell that pizza like a shark can smell blood.

Great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) are huge and powerful warm-blooded fish that have been around for at least 11 million years. Also known as white pointers, their ancestors existed on Earth 400 million years ago, which is 200 million years before the first dinosaur appeared.\n[12] Tigers, like all mammals, are considered to be warm blooded as they use endothermic methods to keep their body temperature at a near constant rate. This means that they contro\u00e2\u0080\u00a6l their temperature via internal means, such as sweating, shivering and panting. 12 people found this useful.\n[13] The predators are also partially endothermic, which means they can generate and retain enough heat to raise their body temperatures to high but stable levels. Most animals thought of as warm-blooded, including mammals and birds, are also both homeothermic and endothermic.\n[14] The skin of the shark has to be very thick in order to assist it to retain heat and to support the muscles that are attached to its inner layers. The largest living shark, the Whale Shark, boasts skin of about 10 centimetres in thickness.\n[15] Basking sharks may be found in all the world's oceans, but they are more common in temperate waters. They may also migrate long distances in winter-one shark tagged off Cape Cod was recorded as far south as Brazil. More \u00c2\u00bb. Shortfin Mako Shark (Isurus oxyrinchus).\n[16] Live-Bearing Sharks. About 60% of the shark species give birth to live young. This is called viviparity. In these sharks, the young remain in the mother's uterus until they are born. The viviparous shark species can be further divided into the ways the young sharks are nourished while in the mother:\n[17] Where do sharks live? Sharks live in oceans all over the world. Most shark species prefer warmer climates and are often found in the sea around Australia, Florida and Mexico. However, other types of sharks like cold water and live in the icy waters of Alaska and Iceland. How do sharks breathe under water? Sharks are a type of fish which means they can breathe easily under water. They breathe through gills that are located on either side of their bodies. Why do sharks have so many teeth?\n[18] The shark is a meat-eating fish and one of the most feared animals in the sea. There are over 300 types of sharks that live in oceans all over the world. Most of them live in warm seas but some sharks prefer colder regions like the seas around Antarctica. The first sharks lived in our oceans about 300 million years ago.\n[19] Sharks are carnivorous and may be found in all seas. They associate humans with food. Sharks do not usually live in fresh waters, but there are exceptions: the river shark and the bull shark. Most sharks are found in 2,000 meters (7,000 ft) level, in warm environments, but they can also be seen in shallow waters.\n[20] Just the thought of sharks still induces a primeval fear in many people, but of those fortunate enough to see live sharks in their own element, most cannot help but have a feeling of admiration for their beauty of movement and their supreme efficiency as predators.asking sharks and other filter feeders like the Whale shark suck water in through their mouths as they swim and purge it through their gill slits, filtering out the food in each mouthful, occupying a similar niche to the baleen whales and the Manta ray.\nSearch Query: how are some sharks warm blooded.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

I'm not sure if there is a scientific explanation for it yet.\n[2] Save the planet! ALL sharks have to swim to breathe, so that water can pass through their gills. There are some sharks in Mexico that can sleep, while resting on the ocean bottom, and do not have to swim to breathe. I saw a TV special YEARS ago regarding Sleeping Nurse Sharks in Florida.\n[3] One is sea surface temperature, which is categorized by ocean regions. The other is ocean depth temperature, which is categorized as shallow, deep or open ocean waters. Sharks can be classified as polar, temperate, or tropical, depending on the surface temperature of the ocean region they inhabit. These temperature regions can be imagined as wide bands drawn over the ocean's surface, showing the range of water temperature within them.\n[4] Sharks have nostrils that they only use to smell. When they swim, water flows through the nostrils, is introduced into the nasal duct and moves the last folds of the skin that has sensory cells. Some sharks, such as the lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostris), can detect a small amount of blood in the water.\n[5] Meet the Comical Opah, the Only Truly Warm-Blooded Fish. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing about the opah that says \u00e2\u0080\u009cfast-moving predator\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Tuna, sharks, and swordfish are fast-moving predators and accordingly, their bodies look like streamlined torpedoes. By contrast, the opah looks like a big startled frisbee, with thin red fins stuck on as an afterthought.\n[6] All sharks mate through internal fertilization. The male inserts one or both of his claspers into the female's reproductive tract and deposits sperm. During this time, the male may use his teeth to hold on to the female, so many females hvae scars and wounds from mating.\n[7] Most fish are cold-blooded. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCold-blooded is a general term used to describe organisms that are unable to regulate their own body temperature. Instead, the organisms body temperature is solely affected by external temperatures, specifically the animals ambient surroundings.

However warm blood is not really the question, many reptiles have blood far warmer than ours, but only on hot days.\n[9] Most species of sharks have five pairs of gill slits on each side of their head, but a few have six or seven pairs. The gills are crucial to a sharks breathing system. By opening its mouth, water is drawn into the shark. The open mouth gives the appearance of a smile in many sharks. When a shark closes its mouth, the water is forced over its gills and the tiny blood vessels in shark gills absorb oxygen from the water. To aid water flowing over its gills most sharks swim forward all the time, called ram ventilation, and is characteristic of more active open ocean sharks.\n[10] Not So Cold Or Warm\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. Most of us learn that insects, fish, reptiles and amphibians are cold blooded because their body temperature changes along with the external temperature, while birds and mammals are warm blooded because they maintain a high body temperature regardless of the external temperature.\n[11] May 14, 2015.

If you look at a shark, you will see it has a number of special adaptations that allow it to fit into an ocean environment. A shark has fins and a streamlined body that help it swim through water.It has gills, which take in oxygen directly out of the water.Because of its gills, sharks can stay underwater and not have to come to the surface to breathe. shark has fins and a streamlined body that help it swim through water. It has gills, which take in oxygen directly out of the water. Because of its gills, sharks can stay underwater and not have to come to the surface to breathe.\n[6] Almost all sharks have sub-terminal mouths except for the whale shark and megamouth sharks. Skimming above the sandy surface, the sharks pluck up crabs, clam siphons, fish eggs, and the burrowing, hot-dog-shaped fat innkeeper worm. As leopard sharks get older, they start eating more fish and fewer crabs.\n[7] Fish are cold blooded animals. What this means is that fish can't regulate their body temperature like warm-blooded animals can. This means that a fish's body temperature is dependent on the temperature of the water it is in. Fish are able to swim through the water by contracting their body and tail muscles. They use their fins to help steer them through the water and also for balance. Most fish have scales, but not all of them do.\n[8] It was once believed that all sharks had to swim constantly in order to breathe and could not sleep for more than a few minutes at a time. Oxygen-rich water flows through the gills during movement allowing the shark to breathe. While some species of sharks do need to swim constantly, this is not true for all sharks. Some sharks such as the nurse shark have spiracles that force water across their gills allowing for stationary rest. Sharks do not sleep like humans do, but instead have active and restful periods.\n[9] Sharks are harder, but some species, such as the Great White, have calcified tissue that grows in layers on their back bones, that can also be used to age the animals. But the Greenland shark is a very, very soft shark - it has no hard body parts where growth layers are deposited.\n[10] Warm and Cold Blooded Animals.

All living things generate waste heat through metabolic processes taking place in their cells.\n[3] scholastic asserts that sharks are especially well adapted to an ocean environment due to their physical features such as streamlined bodies for efficient swimming rows of sharp teeth that grow back after they fall out and gills that extract oxygen from the water so they do not have to surface to breathe\n[4] Well, there is another element. Crocodiles, for all their ability to get their body temperature up when they have sunlight, do very well at low body temperature in the darkness. All their systems continue to work adequately well. There is some speculation that at least all the big dinosaurs were probably homeothermic, or warm-blooded.\n[5] In some sharks, these sensitive cells can detect even the slightest traces of blood in the water. A great white shark, for example, would be able to detect a single drop of blood in an Olympic-size pool. Most sharks can detect blood and animal odors from many miles away.\n[6] But the vast majority of sharks have a buccal (mouth) pump and are not so-called obligate ram ventilators.

Sharks do not sleep like humans do, but instead have active and restful periods.\n[19] The skin of the shark has to be very thick in order to assist it to retain heat and to support the muscles that are attached to its inner layers. The largest living shark, the Whale Shark, boasts skin of about 10 centimetres in thickness.\n[20] Most species of sharks have five pairs of gill slits on each side of their head, but a few have six or seven pairs. The gills are crucial to a sharks breathing system. By opening its mouth, water is drawn into the shark. The open mouth gives the appearance of a smile in many sharks. When a shark closes its mouth, the water is forced over its gills and the tiny blood vessels in shark gills absorb oxygen from the water. To aid water flowing over its gills most sharks swim forward all the time, called ram ventilation, and is characteristic of more active open ocean sharks.\nSearch Query: how are some sharks warm blooded.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

What does it mean to be warm-blooded or cold-blooded? The temperature of an animal's blood is related to its body temperature.\n[2] Although large temperate sharks will travel into tropical waters, they will swim only at depths where the temperature is in their preferred range. Smaller sharks are much more affected by heat and cold and stay within their limits. Sandbar sharks like water temperature between about 15\u00c2\u00b0-30\u00c2\u00b0C (59&deg-86&degF).\n[3] All sharks have an incredibly unique system on the tip of their nose called the \u00e2\u0080\u009campillae of Lorenzini\u00e2\u0080\u009d. These are small pores filled with a gel that transmits the electrical currents in the water to the shark\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brain so that it can assess its environment. White sharks give birth to live young (not eggs), and they give birth to 6-8 pups at one time. Pups are usually between 1.0-1.5m in length and are born with teeth.\n[4] While most sharks prefer warm or temperate water, one shark is built to withstand extreme cold. The Greenland shark lives in the northernmost waters of any shark \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the icy seas of the Arctic Circle, where water temperatures can drop to 30\u00c2\u00b0 Fahrenheit.\n[5] What is Warm Blooded?? We are warm blooded animals, so are all other mammals, to a certain extent, and birds. However warm blood is not really the question, many reptiles have blood far warmer than ours, but only on hot days. In fact, blood temperature is merely a reflection of body temperature.\n[6] Some other cold-blooded creatures use internal mechanisms to maintain body temperatures significantly above the ambient level: 1 Fish have long been thought to be cold blooded. Tuna and swordfish dive deep into the ocean where the water is very cold.\n[7] Sharks are known to have an extremely strong sense of smell for body fluid. However, blood is the most known body fluid that sharks are most attracted to. They can detect even just a small drop of blood from miles away. This amazing theory was proved right when experts conducted an experiment by having a dead fish placed in the water.\n[8] That makes them a favorite of great whites. A high fat diet is mandatory for the great white to maintain its body temperature and keep its brain warm in cold water. Still, sharks do attack people along U.S. coasts and around the world, even if the nature and number of encounters belie expectations.\n[9] One is sea surface temperature, which is categorized by ocean regions. The other is ocean depth temperature, which is categorized as shallow, deep or open ocean waters. Sharks can be classified as polar, temperate, or tropical, depending on the surface temperature of the ocean region they inhabit.These temperature regions can be imagined as wide bands drawn over the ocean's surface, showing the range of water temperature within them.lthough large temperate sharks will travel into tropical waters, they will swim only at depths where the temperature is in their preferred range. Smaller sharks are much more affected by heat and cold and stay within their limits. Sandbar sharks like water temperature between about 15\u00c2\u00b0-30\u00c2\u00b0C (59&deg-86&degF).\n[10] With a few exceptions, all mammals and birds are warm-blooded, and all reptiles, insects, arachnids, amphibians and fish are cold-blooded. What does it mean to be warm-blooded or cold-blooded? The temperature of an animal's blood is related to its body temperature.hese thermal infrared images of warm-blooded animals, show how birds and mammals maintain body temperatures well above the surrounding, cooler air temperature. Cold-blooded creatures take on the temperature of their surroundings. They are hot when their environment is hot and cold when their environment is cold.\n[11] May 14, 2015. Researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration discovered that the opah, a deepwater predatory fish, is able to keep its body warm through a specially designed set of blood vessels in the fish's gills, which allows the fish to circulate warm blood throughout its entire body.

Great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) are huge and powerful warm-blooded fish that have been around for at least 11 million years. Also known as white pointers, their ancestors existed on Earth 400 million years ago, which is 200 million years before the first dinosaur appeared.\n[14] Warm-blooded animals are those that generate their own body heat from food. Birds and mammals are warm-blooded. All other animals, including fish, reptiles, amphibians, and insects, are cold-blooded.

What does it mean to be warm-blooded or cold-blooded? The temperature of an animal's blood is related to its body temperature. Warm-Blooded vs. Cold-Blooded\n[16] All mammals including all humans are warm-blooded. This means that our body temperature is regulated at least to some extent by our body and not totally by the outside temp. Cold blooded animals can only get heat from the sun or a warm surface.Warm blooded.his means that our body temperature is regulated at least to some extent by our body and not totally by the outside temp.

Share to: 1 6 Amazing Fish Facts Fish are amazing creatures. 2 Some are poisonous and some are huge, but all of them are fascinating to watch and learn about.\n[6] Many biological aspects of the basking sharks are still a complete mystery. We do not know where the animals spend the cold season, and their gill rakers - a shedable filter structure in their mouths designed to strain plankton from the water - is a puzzle to scientists.\n[7] Most shark species breathe by swimming. with their mouths open which allows the. water to pass over the gills. Some sharks. like nurse, angel and lemon sharks have. strong neck muscles that pump water over the. gills, allowing the shark to breathe while resting. on the ocean bottom. Sharks are fish, and therefore breathe through the use of. gills, slit-like openings on the sides of their head.\n[8] However, most cold-blooded animals will seek out warm environments because it is easier for them to live when they are warmer. So, fishes in warm environments are technically not cold blooded. For this reason, scientists do not use the term cold blooded.\n[9] In contrast, warm-blooded animals are able to regulate their body temperature by converting the food they eat into energy and thus, create heat. Although most people refer to all types of aquatic animals as fish, there are many exceptions.\n[10] HOW DO SHARKS BREATHE?

Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: how are some sharks warm blooded.\n\n[1] White sharks are part of the fish family, so they must be 'cold-blooded', right? Actually, white sharks are much more complex than you may think. An animal that is 'cold-blooded' means their inside body temperature is dependent on the environment they are in. For example, a snake is cold blooded, so its body temperature fluctuates with the day or even whether or not they are in the sun.\n[2] White sharks have a unique system called a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccounter current heat exchange\u00e2\u0080\u009d, which keeps their body tempreture +/- 7C above the surrounding water temperature.

Measurements of its epaxial (upper back) muscles indicate that this species is able to maintain a body temperature 14 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit (8 to 11 degrees Celsius) above the ambient water temperature.\n[6] But the advantages of endothermy are costly. To maintain a warm body in cold water, a mackerel shark must burn fuel like a blast furnace. A warm-bodied shark may need more than ten times as much food as a cold-bodied shark of the same size.\n[7] For many people, sharks are the epitome of the 'cold-blooded killer'. The warm-bodied mackerel sharks are spectacular reminders that many of our stereotypes are inaccurate. As apex predators, sharks are absolutely essential to the health and vigor of marine ecosystems.\n[8] Large sharks that living in temperate waters include the great white shark, the shortfin mako shark, and the basking shark. These large temperate sharks can generate their own body heat and are therefore able to travel farther than smaller temperate sharks, which cannot.lthough large temperate sharks will travel into tropical waters, they will swim only at depths where the temperature is in their preferred range. Smaller sharks are much more affected by heat and cold and stay within their limits. Sandbar sharks like water temperature between about 15\u00c2\u00b0-30\u00c2\u00b0C (59&deg-86&degF).\n[9] Certain lamnid sharks, tuna and billfishes are also endothermic. In common parlance, endotherms are characterized as warm-blooded .. The opposite of endothermy is ectothermy, although there is no absolute or clear separation between the nature of endotherms and ectotherms in general.\n[10] Regardless sharks are cold blooded, they live either in warm, temperate and cold waters. Some species live mainly in cold waters, while some others prefer warmer waters. SHARK MIGRATION. One thing is for sure; sharks migrate to find new sources of food and they can travel up to hundreds of miles to do that. Most species of sharks live in the oceans. However, some of them are known to dwell in bodies of freshwater, like the bull shark which travels up to 4,000 Km up the Amazon River. Sometimes, sharks reach freshwater bodies; this could be the result of the destruction of their habitat by human activities.\n[11] May 14, 2015.

By contrast, the opah looks like a big startled frisbee, with thin red fins stuck on as an afterthought.\n[14] White sharks have a unique system called a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccounter current heat exchange\u00e2\u0080\u009d, which keeps their body tempreture +/- 7C above the surrounding water temperature. All sharks have an incredibly unique system on the tip of their nose called the \u00e2\u0080\u009campillae of Lorenzini\u00e2\u0080\u009d. These are small pores filled with a gel that transmits the electrical currents in the water to the shark\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brain so that it can assess its environment.\n[15] White sharks are part of the fish family, so they must be 'cold-blooded', right? Actually, white sharks are much more complex than you may think. An animal that is 'cold-blooded' means their inside body temperature is dependent on the environment they are in. For example, a snake is cold blooded, so its body temperature fluctuates with the day or even whether or not they are in the sun.\n[16] Some fish are ectothermic such as the Blue shark whereas others are endothermic such as swordfish and Lamnid sharks.ndothermic = warm-blooded Ectothermic = cold-blooded Endotherms are able to maintain their own body temperature, whereas Ectotherms rely on their environment to regulate body \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 temperature.\n[17] Certain lamnid sharks, tuna and billfishes are also endothermic. In common parlance, endotherms are characterized as warm-blooded .. The opposite of endothermy is ectothermy, although there is no absolute or clear separation between the nature of endotherms and ectotherms in general.\n[18] Gruber: Mackerel sharks, including great whites, makos, threshers, and porbeagles, have a heat-conserving mechanism known as the rete mirabile (wonderful net), a structure for warming blood passing over the gills.\n[19] While most sharks prefer warm or temperate water, one shark is built to withstand extreme cold. The Greenland shark lives in the northernmost waters of any shark \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the icy seas of the Arctic Circle, where water temperatures can drop to 30\u00c2\u00b0 Fahrenheit.\n[20] Sharks have adapted to living in a wide range of aquatic habitats at various temperatures. While some species inhabit shallow, coastal regions, others live in deep waters, on the ocean floor and in the open ocean. Some species, like the bull shark, are even known to swim in salt, fresh and brackish waters.\nSearch Query: how are some sharks warm blooded.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

For instance, you might need to find a line that bisects (divides into equal halves) a given line segment. This middle point is called the midpoint. The concept doesn't come up often, but the Formula is quite simple and obvious, so you should easily be able to remember it for later. The Midpoint Formula works exactly the same way.\n[3] Want to find the area of a trapezoid? If you have the length of each base and the height, you can use them to find the area.

If you have the length of each base and the height, you can use them to find the area. In this tutorial, you'll see how to identify those values and plug them into the formula for the area of a trapezoid. Then see how to simplify to get your answer!\n[4] First you find the area of trapezoid h(a+b)/2 h is the height of the trapezo \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 id, not the height of the prisma is the length of the topb is the length of the bottom Then you find the volume of the trapezoidal prism with this formula H*h(a+b)/2 H is the height of the prism.Multiply H by the area of the trapezoid that you found in step one.\n[5] The perimeter of a trapezoid is simply the sum of all four sides. Since they have no relationship to each other, there is no formula for it. Simply find the four side lengths and add them up.\n[6] Sometimes you need to find the point that is exactly midway between two other points. For instance, you might need to find a line that bisects (divides into two equal halves) a given line segment. This middle point is called the midpoint. The concept doesn't come up often, but the Formula is quite simple and obvious, so you should easily be able to remember it for later.\n[7] So, if you already have the midpoint sum and the trapezoid sum for some number of rectangles or trapezoids, you can obtain the Simpson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rule approximation with the following simple average: Thus, the above formula always involves the same number of rectangles, trapezoids, and Simpson rule \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrapezoids.\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n[8] 5.9 Midsegment Theorem: The segment connecting the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and is half as long. 5.10 If one side of a triangle is longer than another side, then the angle opposite the longer side is larger than the angle opposite the shorter side.\n[9] For example, in the diagram to the right, the bases are parallel.

The centroid is also the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbalancing point\u00e2\u0080\u009d of a triangle.\n[12] = 1 / 2 \u00c3\u0097 (sum of parallel sides) \u00c3\u0097 (distance between them). Formula of Area of a trapezium = 1/2 \u00c3\u0097 (sum of parallel sides) \u00c3\u0097 (distance between them). 1. Two parallel sides of a trapezium are of lengths 27 cm and 19 cm respectively, and the distance between them is 14 cm.Find the area of the trapezium.. The area of a trapezium is 352 cm2 and the distance between its parallel sides is16 cm. If one of the parallel sides is of length 25 cm, find the length of the other. Solution: Let the length of the required side be x cm.\n[13] 8. Find the middle point of one side of the triangle. Take your compass, and open it to wider than \u00c2\u00bd the length of one side of your triangle. Place the needle of the compass at one of the points, and draw the arc, like so. Then place the needle at an adjacent point, and draw the arc again, like this.\n[14] trapezoid, closed plane figure bounded by four line segments, or sides, two of which are parallel and two of which are nonparallel. The parallel sides of a trapezoid are called bases and the nonparallel sides legs; in an isosceles trapezoid the legs are of equal length. The median of a trapezoid is the line segment connecting the midpoints of the legs; it is parallel to the bases and equal to half the sum of their lengths.\n[15] How about this: find the midpoint between the two points (-5, 3) (-1, -3). We could use the formula by calling the first x, x 1, the second one, x 2. Do the same thing with the y s, and substitute the values in like so.\n[16] Remind students that the area of a rectangle is base \u00c3\u0097 height; for the rectangle formed from the original trapezoid, the base is \u00c2\u00bd(b1 + b2) and the height is h, so the area of the rectangle (and, consequently, of the trapezoid) is A = \u00c2\u00bdh(b1 + b2). This is the traditional formula for finding the area of the trapezoid.\n[17] Let's begin studying the area of a trapezoid. The area of a trapezoid is equal to one half the height multiplied by the sum of the lengths of the bases. It is expressed as. where A is the area of the trapezoid, h is the height, and b1 and b2 are the lengths of the two bases. The bases and height of the trapezoid are required in order to determine its area. Let's work on two exercises that will help us apply this area formula to trapezoids. Exercise 1. Find the area of trapezoid ABCD. Solution: This problem appears to be quite simple because we are given the lengths of both bases and the height of the trapezoid.\n[18] Area of a trapezium without knowing the height: (a+c) / 4(a-c) * \u00e2\u0088\u009a(a+b-c+d)(a-b-c+d)(a+b-c-d)(-a+b+c+d) Where a>c and 'a' is parallel to 'c'. 'b' and 'd' are the 'diagonals'. Therefore, (40+30) / 4(40-30) * \u00e2\u0088\u009a(40+14-30+16)(40-14-30+16)(40+14-30-16)(-40+14+30+16) 70 / 40 * \u00e2\u0088\u009a(40)(12)(8)(20) 7/4 * 277.128129... 484.974\n[19] These seven line segments all meet at the centroid of the tetrahedron. The medians are divided by the centroid in the ratio 3:1. The centroid of a tetrahedron is the midpoint between its Monge point and circumcenter (center of the circumscribed sphere).\n[20] Question: Here's the question: Suppose M is the Midpoint of segment AB, P is the midpoint of segment AM, and Q is the midpoint of segment PM. If a and b are the coordinates of points A and B on a number line, find the coordintes of P and Q in the terms of a and b.\nSearch Query: how to find the midsegment of a trapezoid.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

The figure shown below gives an illustration of the midpoint formula.\n[6] and parallel to them: EF || AD and EF || BC. A trapezoid with equal lateral sides ( AB = CD ) is called an isosceles trapezoid. In an isosceles trapezoid angles by each base, are equal ( A = D, B = C ). A parallelogram can be considered as a particular case of trapezoid. Midline of a triangle is a segment, joining midpoints of lateral sides of a triangle.\n[7] By constructing segments connecting the midpoints, we have the medial triangle A B C which is also a right triangle.

Filmmaker: Bing Hu\n[3] In order to find the area of an isoceles trapezoid, you must average the bases and multiply by the height. The average of the bases is straight forward: In order to find the height, you must draw an altitude.

The area of a trapezoid is equal to one half the height multiplied by the sum of the lengths of the bases. It is expressed as. where A is the area of the trapezoid, h is the height, and b1 and b2 are the lengths of the two bases. The bases and height of the trapezoid are required in order to determine its area. Let's work on two exercises that will help us apply this area formula to trapezoids. Exercise 1. Find the area of trapezoid ABCD. Solution: This problem appears to be quite simple because we are given the lengths of both bases and the height of the trapezoid.\n[20] Sometimes you need to find the point that is exactly between two other points. For instance, you might need to find a line that bisects (divides into equal halves) a given line segment. This middle point is called the midpoint. The concept doesn't come up often, but the Formula is quite simple and obvious, so you should easily be able to remember it for later. The Midpoint Formula works exactly the same way.\nSearch Query: how to find the midsegment of a trapezoid.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

This segment's length is always equal to one-half the sum of the trapezoid's bases, or. Consider trapezoid ABCD shown below.\n[2] The midsegment (also called the median or midline) of a trapezoid is the segment that joins the midpoints of the legs. It is parallel to the bases. Its length m is equal to the average of the lengths of the bases a and b of the trapezoid,n obtuse trapezoid with two pairs of parallel sides is a parallelogram. A parallelogram has central 2-fold rotational symmetry (or point reflection symmetry). There is some disagreement whether parallelograms, which have two pairs of parallel sides, should be regarded as trapezoids.\n[3] According to this theorem mid segment of a trapezoid is equal to half of sum of its two parallel sides. In triangle ABC M is mid point of AB and P is midpoint of AC. so MP is mid segment of triangle ABC. similarly just apply this rule in triangle ACD the PN is midsegment of triangle ACD.\n[4] In the trapezoid below, the midpoints of the non-parallel sides are points S and V.

Consider trapezoid ABCD shown below. The midsegment, EF, which is shown in red, has a length of. The measurement of the midsegment is only dependent on the length of the trapezoid's bases.\n[6] In the trapezoid below, the midpoints of the non-parallel sides are points S and V. The midsegment is the red line segment from S to V. The midsegment below can be found by. 1 calculating the lengths of the bases. 35-16 = 9 (length of upper base)\n[7] The side of the triangle that the midsegment does not intersect is the base of the triangle. The midsegment of a trapezoid is the segment formed by connecting the midpoints of the two legs of a trapezoid. Although the midsegment of a trapezoid is also useful in mathematics, we will not discuss it here.\n[8] Median of a Trapezoid The median (also called a midline or midsegment) is a line segment half-way between the two bases. The median's length is the average of the two base lengths: m = a+b2\n[9] The top and bottom sides of the trapezoid run parallel to each other, so they are the trapezoid's bases. The other sides of the trapezoid will intersect if extended, so they are the trapezoid's legs. The segment that connects the midpoints of the legs of a trapezoid is called the midsegment.\n[10] Median: The median of a trapezoid is a line joining the midpoints of the two legs. See Trapezoid median: Area: The usual way to calculate the area is the average base length times altitude. See Area of a Trapezoid: Perimeter: The distance a round the trapezoid. The sum of its side lengths. See Perimeter of a Trapezoid\n[11] The opposite sides of a trapezoid that are parallel to each other are called bases. The remaining sides of the trapezoid, which intersect at some point if extended, are called the legs of the trapezoid. The top and bottom sides of the trapezoid run parallel to each other, so they are the trapezoid's bases. The other sides of the trapezoid will intersect if extended, so they are the trapezoid's legs. The segment that connects the midpoints of the legs of a trapezoid is called the midsegment.\n[12] The median of a trapezoid is a segment parallel to the bases that connects the midpoints of the non-parallel sides. This line is special because we can determine its length directly from the length of the two bases. No joke.\n[13] The segment EF, joining midpoints E and F of the lateral sides, is called a midline of a trapezoid. A midline of a trapezoid is equal to a half-sum of bases: and parallel to them: EF || AD and EF || BC. A trapezoid with equal lateral sides ( AB = CD ) is called an isoscelestrapezoid. In an isosceles trapezoid angles by each base, are equal ( A = D, B = C ). A parallelogram can be considered as a particular case of trapezoid. Midline of a triangle is a segment, joining midpoints of lateral sides of a triangle.\n[14] 1 The midsegment is parallel to the base. 2 The triangle formed by the midsegment and the two half sides have all the same angle measures as the original triangle. The perimeter of the triangle formed by the midsegment and the two half sides is equal to one half the perimeter of the original triangle.\n[15] Midsegment Theorem Proof. The mid segment theorem states that a segment that connects the mid points of any two sides is parallel to the third side and also its measure is half the measure of the third side. That is, DE ll AB and DE = $\\frac{1}{2}$ AB. Therefore, CA = CD + DA = 2 CD.\n[16] No, wait, that's unicorns. Here, B is the midpoint of AC, and D is the midpoint of CE. We can be sure of that because we're told that the segments are congruent on each side of both of those points. Connecting them, we get the midsegment BD. TMT says that BD || AE and that BD = \u00c3\u0097 AE.\n[17] We will also construct the segment DE. Finally, the centroid, the intersection of medians BF and AE (and CD as proposed by this proof) will be G. The triangle is as follows. Note that DE is a midsegment of the triangle, so it is parallel with AC, and is 1/2 the length of AC. So let us consider triangles AGC and EGD.\n[18] Every trapezoid has two legs.

Explanation: A midsegment of a trapezoid is a segment that connects the midpoints of the two non-parallel sides of a trapezoid. This segment has two special properties. It is parallel to the bases of the trapezoid. The length of the midsegment is the average of the lengths of the two bases. Remember that the bases of a trapezoid are parallel. Key Curriculum Press can provide demo versions of Geometer's Sketch Pad.\n[8] A trapezoid midsegment connects the midpoints of the two congruent sides of the trapezoid, and is parallel to the pair of parallel sides. The length of the midsegment is the sum of the two bases divided by 2. Remember that the bases of a trapezoid are the two parallel sides. To find angles within a trapezoid, remember that since there are two sides are parallel, the other sides can be seen as transversals, forming corresponding angles and same side interior angles.\n[9] The midsegment of a trapezoid has two special properties: 1 The midsegment of a trapezoid is parallel to each base. 2 The length of the midsegment of a trapezoid is equal to half the sum of the lengths of its bases.\n[10] The midsegment (also called the median or midline) of a trapezoid is the segment that joins the midpoints of the legs.

The McDouble contains gristle and carry's a different flavor than the Double Cheeseburger. The double cheeseburger tastes more like beef. The McDouble tastes of whatever meat filler they use to fill the gap.\n[2] At first glance, the double cheeseburger looks a lot like the McDouble, but it is not exactly the same thing. The main difference that you will notice is the amount of cheese that is on this sandwich. There are two slices of cheese on the double cheeseburger instead of just the one slice of cheese that comes on the McDouble. Even though it comes with two slices of cheese, it still has the onions, pickles, ketchup and mustard that come on the other burgers.\n[3] A double cheesburger has 2 slices of cheese with 2 meat patties. A mcdouble on the other hand only had 1 slice of cheese, but still 2 pieces of meat. I say had because mcdoubles arent sold in Australia (maybe a few stores but not a regular menu item) anymore. Other countries might be different but that's the difference in Australia.\n[4] The McDouble is listed as a slice of American cheese between two 100% beef patties, topped with pickles, onions, ketchup and mustard. mcdonalds.com.

When it comes to the various sizes of classic McDonald\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cheeseburgers, the prices might have you scratching your head. The price differences between a McDonald\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Cheeseburger, the beefier McDouble and the cheesier Double Cheeseburger now all fall within 50-cents of one another.\n[6] But I did it for you. With McDonald's recent release of the McDouble, they now have three basic, sub-$2 cheeseburgers: the cheeseburger, McDouble (two patties with one slice of cheese), and double cheeseburger (two patties with two slices of cheese).\n[7] The difference is that the Mighty Kid's Meal provides more food than what is typically found in a Happy Meal, providing a McDouble (a cheeseburger consisting of two patties and one slice of cheese) instead of a cheeseburger or a hamburger, and more Chicken McNuggets (6 versus 4), plus a larger drink (16oz vs 12oz).\n[8] Although we previously reported that the McDouble would be on the Dollar Menu, in Manhattan the cheeseburger appears on the Dollar Menu while the McDouble is $1.39 and the double cheeseburger is $1.49.\n[9] The Double Cheeseburger is priced at $1.49 and my Triple Cheeseburger was priced at $2.19. I just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand the point of paying 70-cents for an extra burger patty when you can just get two McDoubles for $2.00. Obviously the value of the Triple Cheeseburger makes no sense when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re comparing menu items.\n[10] Mcdonald's - Mcdouble (Cheeseburger) *Percent Daily Values are based on a 2000 calorie diet.

Both the 2 year and the BSN graduates sit for the exact same licensure exam and earn the same RN license.SN = Bachelor of Science in Nursing, which is just a 4 year RN degree. Both the 2 year and the BSN graduates sit for the exact same licensure exam and earn the same RN license.\n[19] You are considered a RN if you have a ASN (Associate of Science in Nursing) or a BSN (Bachelor of Science in Nursing). The difference with ASN and BSN is ASN is a 2 year degree and BSN is a 4 year degree. You will get paid more with a BSN. And I think hospitals are looking more for BSN students.If I were 18, I would go straight thru the 4 years.ut, you're still an RN either way. The best jobs will require the master's degree and have titles like Family Nurse Practitioner or Nurse Anesthetist with salaries nearing $100K per year. They are still an RN-they just have more training than most RNs.\n[20] RN-to-BSN. Another bridge program, an RN-to-BSN degree is designed for registered nurse graduates of associate degree or diploma programs who want to complete their BSN degree. Your time: Instead of going through an entire BSN program from the start, RNs can save time (and money) going this route.areer track: If you look at job postings, you'll find that a BSN degree is a requirement for many positions. It is the entry point for professional nursing practice. If you plan to pursue a higher degree, earning a BSN out of the gate is probably your best option since it will be a prerequisite for master's programs.\nSearch Query: difference between rn and bsn.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

RN is a Registered Nurse, and is a health care specialist who uses her learned nursing practices and processes to take care of an ailing person. A Registered Nurse is trained and qualified to treat patients. The Associate degree is two years, but on the other hand, the Bachelors degree takes four years.\n[5] So first of all, you should know RN stands for Registered Nurse. And BSN stands for Bachelors of Science and Nursing. So right off the by, you see there's a difference. The BSN is a degree that you get in a university. It's usually a four year degree. And from there, you can take a state regulated test or the NCLEX.\n[6] Transitioning from an RN to a BSN. A BSN is a four-year degree program that allows graduates access to a broader range of career opportunities. BSN graduates can work in administration, research, consulting, teaching, and leadership roles while commanding a higher salary than most diploma nurses.\n[7] BSN stands for Bachelor of Science in nursing whereas RN stands for registered nurse. There are currently two types of registered nursing degrees being offered by colleges and universities in the US. You can gain an associate's degree in nursing or a bachelors of science in nursing.: There are a number of online and on-campus institutes offering RN to BSN of nursing.

Someone with a BSN degree has a broad range of knowledge and can get to work in a variety of different nursing fields. Usually, someone with a BSN will work directly with patients on hospital wards or in community health centers for instance. An MSN program, on the other hand, is more focused.\n[9] In the end, the outcome is the same. The major difference is the path and time commitment required to become an RN. You can go straight to the job market as an RN or you can further your education with a BSN degree.\n[10] BSN degree nurses are better prepared to meet patient needs. The main difference in study between an ADN and BSN is the emphasis on additional education in leadership and management, wellness, and community nursing.\n[11] First of all, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s establish what each one stands for.

However, BSN-prepared nurses have been linked to better patient outcomes, lower mortality, and lower failure to rescue rates, according to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) .\n[14] RN vs. BSN: education requirements. The first thing you should know is that becoming an RN means passing the NCLEX exam. There is no way around it. To be eligible to sit for the NCLEX you must first earn either an associate degree in nursing (ADN) or a Bachelor of Science in nursing (BSN).The former requires completion of a 21-month program at a career-focused college. nurse with a BSN may do the same things as an RN, or they may choose to work in public health or be a nurse educator. Public health nurses generally educate communities on health issues, while nurse educators prepare the next generation of LPNs and RNs.\n[15] There are admission standards at both the associate degree (ADN) and baccalaureate (BSN) levels. BSN programs are often more academically competitive. Higher level nursing programs are also more likely to ask for a resume, personal statement, and references. BSN programs include additional coursework in areas like nursing research, leadership, and public health.\n[16] ADN vs. BSN Degree. Trying to decide whether to pursue an Associate Degree in Nursing (ADN) or Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) can be a difficult decision.

If you decide on going the ADN route but eventually want to earn the higher academic credential, you can earn a BSN through a completer program in as little as 12 additional months and it can often be done online.\n[18] The advantage of the BSN is that more job opportunities in the future are available, just as in reasearch, teaching, management, public health, etc. But the ASN and the BSN RNs start off pretty much doing the same thing. Many people like myself get the ASN and then do a RN to BSN bridge.\n[19] Although this PayScale.com data isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as expansive as the BLS data, it does give us some idea of the difference between RN and BSN pay. With that said the actual difference between an RN (ADN) and an RN (BSN) might be better measured in the way of professional opportunity and options for upward mobility rather than the actual pay for a position.\n[20] The difference between the 2 is many more general education courses, and ,more nursing courses which would include Public Health Nursing, nursing research, nursing leadership / management, and more in-depth learning about different nursing care models and the history of the profession.SN = Bachelor of Science in Nursing, which is just a 4 year RN degree.

Summary: RN is a Registered Nurse, while BSN is a graduate program in nursing.\n[4] Comparing the RN and BSN: What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the Difference? Many people are unfamiliar with the different types of nursing credentials. Nurses may hold one of several types of degrees ranging from the licensed practical nurse (LPN) to a Master of Nursing (MSN) or doctorate (DNP). One of the most commonly confused comparisons is that of the Registered Nurse (RN) and the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) prepared nurse.\n[5] What Is the Difference Between RN and BSN Degrees? A registered nurse (RN) is a nurse who has passed the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX-RN) after completing an accredited training program. These programs come in the form of an Associate of Science in Nursing (ASN) or a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN).\n[6] You might be interested to know that both the ASN graducate and the BSN graduate both get the RN and have the same duties as an RN when they graduate. The advantage of the BSN is that more job opportunities in the future are available, just as in reasearch, teaching, management, public health, etc.\n[7] \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Categorized under Science | Difference Between Rn and Bsn RN vs BSN RN is a Registered Nurse, and is a health care specialist who uses her learned nursing practices and processes to take care of an ailing person.\n[8] RN vs BSN: Whats the Difference? The RN vs BSN is a common debate. Both allow you to work as a registered nurse, but what is the benefit and difference of getting a BSN versus RN.

That's because CP is a condition that can affect the things that kids do every day. Some kids with CP use wheelchairs and others walk with the help of crutches or braces. In some cases, a kid's speech may be affected or the person might not be able to speak at all. Cerebral palsy (say: seh-REE-brel PAWL-zee) is a condition that affects thousands of babies and children each year.\n[2] Symptoms of dysarthria. A child or adult with dysarthria may have: slurred, nasal-sounding or breathy speech. a strained and hoarse voice. excessively loud or quiet speech. problems speaking in a regular rhythm, with frequent hesitations. gurgly-sounding or monotone speech. difficulty with tongue and lip movements.\n[3] Phonation As with spastic dysarthria, vocal quality may be described as harsh, strained, or strangled. Voice stoppages may occur in dysarthria associated with dystonia. Resonance Hypernasality is common. Speech When voluntary speech movements are made there is often a super-imposition of involuntary movements.\n[4] While there are few data on the laryngeal abnormalities of patients with PD, the classic pathophysiology of hypokinetic dysarthria includes dysfunction of vocal fold kinematics (i.e., slow opening and inadequate closing of the vocal folds), vocal fold asymmetry and bowing, and vocal fold paresis.\n[5] Recognised characteristics of progressive neurological disorders that affect communication: Flaccid/spastic/hyperkinetic dysarthria (when the muscles needed for speaking and breath control are affected).\n[6] Cerebral palsy and communication. Cerebral palsy is the term used to describe several conditions caused by a brain injury during brain development. The brain injury results in the lack of muscular and joint control, which results in disrupted coordinated movement.peech therapists also help children with cerebral palsy and communication skills. Communication skills may mean talking, using sign language, or using a communication aid. Speech therapists help children with cerebral palsy that are able to talk by working with them on making their speech easier to understand.\n[7] Spastic cerebral palsy is the most common type of cerebral palsy. The muscles of people with spastic cerebral palsy feel stiff and their movements may look stiff and jerky. Spasticity is a form of hypertonia, or increased muscle tone. This results in stiff muscles which can make movement difficult or even impossible.\n[8] The brain injury that causes cerebral palsy affects motor function, the ability to control the body in a desired matter. Two main groupings include spastic and non-spastic. Each has multiple variations and it is possible to have a mixture of both types.Spastic cerebral palsy is characterized by increased muscle tone.ypes of Cerebral Palsy. Several cerebral palsy classification systems exist today to define the type and form of cerebral palsy an individual has. The classification is complicated by the wide range of clinical presentations and degrees of activity limitation that exist.\n[9] Refers to a group of speech disorders resulting from weakness, slowness, or incoordination of the speech mechanism due to damage to any of a variety of points in the nervous system. Dysarthria may involve disorders to some or all of the basic speech processes: respiration phonation, resonance, articulation, and prosody. Dysarthria is a disorder of speech production not language (e.g., use of vocabulary and/or grammar).\n[10] Hypertonic and Hypotonic Cerebral Palsy. As the most common form of cerebral palsy (CP), hypertonic CP accounts for 80% of all cases in the United States. Hypertonic CP is considered spastic, marked by extremely stiff muscles. On the other hand, hypotonic CP, marked by extremely loose and floppy muscle tone, accounts for less than half of all CP cases.\n[11] Spastic cerebral palsy is the most common type. A person with spastic CP develops tight muscles in some parts of the body that are unable to relax. Affected joints become stiff and hard to move. Usually, a person has problems controlling movements, poor coordination and balance, and difficulty talking and eating.\n[12] Speech therapy has widespread benefits for cerebral palsy patients. Not only does the process improve communication interactions, but speech therapy can also be used to strengthen and improve facial and oral muscle control. Dysphagia and oral feeding difficulties affect cerebral palsy patients in several ways.\n[13] 1 Treatment for dysarthria differs from that employed for language disorders. 2 Dysarthrias result from disruption of muscular control. 3 Due to damage of the CNS or PNS or both. 4 There is some involvement of the basic motor processes used in speech and this results in a movement disorder. Dysarthria refers to a group of disorders rather than a single disorder. 2 It is more appropriate to refer the plural form dysarthrias rather than the singular form dysarthria.\n[14] Dysarthria is a motor speech disorder resulting from neurological injury of the motor component of the motor-speech system and is characterized by poor articulation of phonemes (cf. aphasia: a disorder of the content of language).\n[15] A generic term for any speech disorder caused by an alteration of strength and control of speech muscles due to damage to the brain or nerves. Dysarthria may indicate increased posterior fossa pressure on the brainstem/medulla oblongata. Difficulty in speaking or forming words.\n[16] Distortions are the most common type of error in dysarthria. Apraxia In apraxia, errors are inconsistent and unpredictable. Different error patterns occur in spontaneous speech versus repetition. Patients' spontaneous speech contains fewer errors than does his/her speech in repetition tasks.istortions are the most common type of error in dysarthria. Apraxia In apraxia, errors are inconsistent and unpredictable. Different error patterns occur in spontaneous speech versus repetition. Patients' spontaneous speech contains fewer errors than does his/her speech in repetition tasks.\n[17] Spastic cerebral palsy, or cerebral palsy where spasticity (muscle tightness) is the exclusive or almost exclusive impairment present, is by far the most common type of overall cerebral palsy, occurring in upwards of 70% of all cases.\n[18] Cerebral palsy can affect a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s posture, balance and ability to move, communicate, eat, sleep and learn. The parts of the body affected by cerebral palsy, the level of severity and combination of symptoms can differ for each person.For example, one person may have a weakness in one hand and find tasks like writing or tying shoelaces challenging.ecause cerebral palsy can affect the muscles around the mouth, 1 in 5 children with cerebral palsy have saliva loss (also known as dribbling, drooling or sialorhrea). The saliva loss may be more noticeable when they are concentrating on a fine motor task.\n[19] Athetosis is another characteristic of dyskinetic cerebral palsy, marked by slow twitching and wriggling movements. The symptoms can surface while resting and generally become worse when the child moves. Other common symptoms of athetosis include: Repetitive, jerky movements.\n[20] Spastic CP is the most common type. People will experience increased muscle tone and their movements may appear stiff or awkward. Different parts of the body can be affected: 1 Spastic hemiplegia/hemiparesis (Fig. 2 the arm, hand, and leg on one side of the body. 3 Spastic diplegia/diparesis (Fig. 4 stiffness that is predominantly in the legs. 5 be affected to a lesser extent. 6 Spastic quadriplegia/quadriparesis (Fig. 7 severe form of CP. 8 the brain or significant brain malformations.\nSearch Query: types of dysarthria from cerebral palsy.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Loss of speech from dysarthria (difficulty talking), hearing loss, and vision loss can occur.\n[2] Dysarthria represents a neuromuscular disorder of speech. That is, it is a problem with speech pronunciation, which arises in relation to disorders of the central or peripheral nervous system that impairs the nerve pathways and muscle movements involved in the production of speech.006). Lesions of the cerebellum, in analogy to limb motor control disruptions, brought about ataxic dysarthria, with a corresponding dysmetric (over and undershooting) movements and dysrhythmic (dysfluent, uneven) flow of speech (Spencer and Slocomb 2007).\n[3] Dysphonia is classified as either an organic or a functional disorder of the larynx. Another type of communication problem, dysarthria, encompasses a group of motor speech disorders caused by a disturbance in the neuromuscular control of speech.\n[4] Because it involves problems with the transfer of information from the nervous system to the muscles, dysarthria is classified as a neuromotor disorder. Central Nervous System Lesions Damage to the pyramidal tract causes spastic dysarthria.\n[5] dysarthria A generic term for any speech disorder caused by an alteration of strength and control of speech muscles due to damage to the brain or nerves. Dysarthria may indicate increased posterior fossa pressure on the brainstem/medulla oblongata. Clinical findings Difficulty in speaking or forming words. dysarthria\n[6] Phonation and the rate of facial movements may also be affected. Understanding the nature and course of dysarthria in. amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is important because loss of communication prevents patients from participating in. many activities, may lead to social isolation, and reduces the quality of life.\n[7] Hemiplegia or diplegia: One arm and one leg on the same side of the body (hemiplegia) or both legs (diplegia or paraplegia) are affected. These are the most common types of spastic cerebral palsy. Monoplegia: Only one arm or leg is affected. Quadriplegia : Both arms and both legs are affected. Usually the trunk and muscles that control the mouth, tongue, and windpipe are affected too. This makes eating and talking difficult.\n[8] There are four types of spastic CP, grouped according to how many limbs are affected. Hemiplegia or diplegia: One arm and one leg on the same side of the body (hemiplegia) or both legs (diplegia or paraplegia) are affected. These are the most common types of spastic cerebral palsy.\n[9] A person with dysarthria may demonstrate the following speech characteristics: 1 Slurred, choppy, or mumbled speech that may be difficult to understand. 2 Slow rate of speech. 3 Rapid rate of speech with a mumbling quality. 4 Limited tongue, lip, and jaw movement.\n[10] Cerebral Palsy Types.

Whether dysarthria will improve with speech and language therapy depends on the cause and the extent of the brain damage or dysfunction.\n[5] The key point is that dysarthria is a symptom, and diagnosis of the cause is essential. It may be due to a disorder of the brain (such as following a stroke) or nerve supply to the muscles of speech, which involve the face, the tongue, or the muscles of the throat. There are several types of dysarthria.\n[6] Cerebral palsy is classified into different types to help describe how each condition affects the individual. Each type of cerebral palsy is classified based on two factors: the type and location of movement issues.For example, spasticity (type) in the legs (location) is known as spastic diplegia.

That is, it is a problem with speech pronunciation, which arises in relation to disorders of the central or peripheral nervous system that impairs the nerve pathways and muscle movements involved in the production of speech.006). Lesions of the cerebellum, in analogy to limb motor control disruptions, brought about ataxic dysarthria, with a corresponding dysmetric (over and undershooting) movements and dysrhythmic (dysfluent, uneven) flow of speech (Spencer and Slocomb 2007).\n[15] Because it involves problems with the transfer of information from the nervous system to the muscles, dysarthria is classified as a neuromotor disorder.

Dysarthria may involve disorders to some or all of the basic speech processes: respiration phonation, resonance, articulation, and prosody. Dysarthria is a disorder of speech production not language (e.g., use of vocabulary and/or grammar).\n[18] Dysarthria is a motor speech disorder resulting from neurological injury of the motor component of the motor-speech system and is characterized by poor articulation of phonemes (cf. aphasia: a disorder of the content of language).\n[19] Dysarthria is a speech impairment in which the child has difficulty producing sound and articulating words. Loss of speech from dysarthria (difficulty talking), hearing loss, and vision loss can occur.\n[20] Dysphonia is classified as either an organic or a functional disorder of the larynx.

Regarding differential diagnosis dysarthria is distinguished from several other speech disorders with which it may be confused or co-occur. Dysarthria is a problem with the execution of movements to produce sound, with the medium, not the message.In this sense, it contrasts with aphasia, a disorder of language where problems entail understanding others or finding the words and grammatical structures to convey meaning to express ideas.006). Lesions of the cerebellum, in analogy to limb motor control disruptions, brought about ataxic dysarthria, with a corresponding dysmetric (over and undershooting) movements and dysrhythmic (dysfluent, uneven) flow of speech (Spencer and Slocomb 2007).\n[2] Spastic Diplegia Cerebral Palsy. Diplegic cerebral palsy, also known as spastic diplegia, is one of nine different types of cerebral palsy. The most common problem with the disorder in muscle stiffness. It manifest during infancy and early childhood, with the average age of diagnosis being three years old.\n[3] Dysarthria In dysarthria, errors are consistent and predictable. There are no islands of clear speech; no matter what the speaking task or materials used, the patient will exhibit the same amount and types of errors. Errors are mainly distortions and omissions. Distortions are the most common type of error in dysarthria. Apraxia In apraxia, errors are inconsistent and unpredictable. Different error patterns occur in spontaneous speech versus repetition. Patients' spontaneous speech contains fewer errors than does his/her speech in repetition tasks.\n[4] Spastic cerebral palsy is the most common type of the disorder. People have stiff muscles and awkward movements. Forms of spastic cerebral palsy include: 1 Spastic hemiplegia/hemiparesis typically affects the arm and hand on one side of the body, but it can also include the leg.ixed types of cerebral palsy refer to symptoms that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t correspond to any single type of CP but are a mix of types. For example, a child with mixed CP may have some muscles that are too tight and others that are too relaxed, creating a mix of stiffness and floppiness.\n[5] The term dysarthria encompasses a group of motor speech disorders caused by a disturbance in the neuromuscular control of speech. These disorders result from central or peripheral nervous system damage and are manifested as weakness, slowness, or incoordination of speech.\n[6] Spastic (pyramidal) cerebral palsy. Spastic cerebral palsy is the most common type. A person with spastic CP develops tight muscles in some parts of the body that are unable to relax. Affected joints become stiff and hard to move. Usually, a person has problems controlling movements, poor coordination and balance, and difficulty talking and eating.\n[7] In general, however, dysarthria can be distinguished by: 1 Slurred words and sentences. 2 Excessive slow or rapid speaking patterns. 3 Low or uneven volume, sometimes limited to a whisper. 4 Strained voice. 5 Monotone speech. 6 Drooling. 7 Noticeable difficulty in controlling facial muscles and tongue.\n[8] The list below shows some of the causes of Dysarthria mentioned in various sources: 1 Aceruloplasminemia - dysarthria. 2 Acquired brain injury. 3 Alcoholic cerebellar degeneration. 4 Alopecia -- hypogonadism -- extrapyramidal disorder - dysarthria. 5 Amyloidosis, oculoleptomeningeal - dysarthria. 6 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\n[9] Cerebral palsy is a group of disorders that can involve brain and nervous system functions, such as movement, learning, hearing, seeing, and thinking. There are several different types of cerebral palsy, including spastic, dyskinetic, ataxic, hypotonic, and mixed.\n[10] Children with cerebral palsy often have a disability that renders them unable to communicate. To complicate issues more, if the child has a severe form of cerebral palsy, he or she may not be able to write, type, point, or sign.erebral palsy affects muscle tone, gross and fine motor functions, balance, coordination, and posture. These conditions are mainly orthopedic in nature and are considered primary conditions of cerebral palsy.\n[11] Types of Cerebral Palsy.

Regarding differential diagnosis dysarthria is distinguished from several other speech disorders with which it may be confused or co-occur. Dysarthria is a problem with the execution of movements to produce sound, with the medium, not the message.In this sense, it contrasts with aphasia, a disorder of language where problems entail understanding others or finding the words and grammatical structures to convey meaning to express ideas.006). Lesions of the cerebellum, in analogy to limb motor control disruptions, brought about ataxic dysarthria, with a corresponding dysmetric (over and undershooting) movements and dysrhythmic (dysfluent, uneven) flow of speech (Spencer and Slocomb 2007).\n[20] The term dysarthria encompasses a group of motor speech disorders caused by a disturbance in the neuromuscular control of speech.

Speech impairments in spastic dysarthria involves four major abnormalities of voluntary movement: spasticity, weakness, limited range of motion and slowness of movement.\n[2] Sensorimotor impairments such as muscle weakness, incoordination, reduced or excessive movement, involuntary muscle activity, and altered tone occur across multiple dysarthria types, so clinicians must identify particular configurations of these abnormalities in order to differentiate among the disorders [3].\n[3] Dysarthria is a feature of many neurological diseases including cerebral palsy, stroke, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson s disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis. Dysarthria is a relatively common symptom of multiple sclerosis and can take many forms.Episodic paroxysmal dysarthria, which is where the dysarthria lasts for up to a minute or so and recurs several times a day, is particulary common in MS.ysarthria refers to speech problems that are caused by the muscles involved with speaking or the nerves controlling them. Both muscle weakness and incoordination can give rise to dysarthria. Speech problems that result from cognitive dysfunction are not dysarthria.\n[4] Some of the types of speech impairments include: 1 Dysarthria, a physical weakness or paralysis of the speech muscles caused by nerve or brain damage. 2 Dysprosody, characterized by changes in the intensity of volume, timing of words, and rhythm and intonation of words while speaking.\n[5] The types of cerebral palsy are: 1 spastic: the most common type of cerebral palsy; reflexes are exaggerated and muscle movement is stiff. 2 dyskinetic: dyskinetic cerebral palsy is divided into two categories.ther Types of Cerebral Palsy. Symptoms of other types of cerebral palsy may also include floppy muscle tone and lack of muscle coordination. Tremors or an unsteady gait are also common.\n[6] The ability to speak may be impaired as a result of physical, not intellectual, impairment. Non-spastic cerebral palsy is divided into two groups, ataxic and dyskinetic. Together they make up 20% of cerebral palsy cases. Broken down, dyskinetic makes up 15% of all cerebral palsy cases, and ataxic comprises 5%.\n[7] 1 These are the most common types of spastic cerebral palsy. 2 Monoplegia: Only one arm or leg is affected.

Great question. Not all key pairs are created equal. They the keys used for a self signed certificate (https) are not the same key-pair used for SSH. Different keys, different rules about what needs to be in place before they are created.\n[7] Many protocols like SSH, OpenPGP, S/MIME, and SSL / TLS rely on RSA for encryption and digital signature functions. It is also used in software programs -- browsers are an obvious example, which need to establish a secure connection over an insecure network like the Internet or validate a digital signature.\n[8] A public-key encryption technology developed by RSA Data Security, Inc.

RSA keys are generated in pairs--one public RSA key and one private RSA key. If your router already has RSA keys when you issue this command, you will be warned and prompted to replace the existing keys with new keys.amed Key Pairs. If you generate a named key pair using the key-label argument, you must also specify the usage-keys keyword or the general-keys keyword. Named key pairs allow you to have multiple RSA key pairs, enabling the Cisco IOS software to maintain a different key pair for each identity certificate.\n[11] RSA SecurID software tokens use the same industry-leading, time-based algorithm as the RSA SecurID hardware tokens. Instead of being stored in hardware, the software token symmetric key is secured on the user\u00e2\u0080\u0099s PC, laptop, smartphone or USB device.\n[12] Techopedia explains RSA Encryption. RSA encryption is a public key encryption technology developed by RSA Data Security, which licenses the algorithm technologies and also sells the development kits. RSA is built into many common software products, including Microsoft's Internet Explorer.\n[13] With reference to man ssh-keygen, the length of a DSA key is restricted to exactly 1024 bit to remain compliant with NIST's FIPS 186-2. Nonetheless, longer DSA keys are theoretically possible; FIPS 186-3 explicitly allows them. Furthermore, security is no longer guaranteed with 1024 bit long RSA or DSA keys. In conclusion, a 2048 bit RSA key is currently the best choice.\n[14] During the SecurID authentication process, users must submit their username and passcode using an HTML form. The RSA Authentication Manager authenticates the identity of each user through a server that is registered with the Authentication Manager as a client (RSA Authentication Agent).racle Access Manager supports all RSA SecurID token form factors, both hardware and software-based. These tokens algorithmically, based on an internal clock or event, generate tokencodes with unpredictable values. Together, the user's PIN and the SecurID tokencode become the user's Passcode.\n[15] Founded as an independent company in 1982, RSA Security, Inc. was acquired by EMC Corporation in 2006 for US$2.1 billion and operates as a division within EMC. RSA is based in Bedford, Massachusetts, with regional headquarters in Bracknell (UK) and Singapore, and numerous international offices.\n[16] When we say a 1024-bit RSA key, we mean that the modulus has length 1024 bits, i.e. is an integer greater than 21023 but lower than 21024. Such an integer could be encoded as a sequence of 1024 bits, i.e. 128 bytes.he length of a key in bits nothing more than a specification of its size. A 128 bit key takes up 16 bytes of space -- just the raw bits that the processor uses. There is nothing special, no translation.\n[17] This new ciphertext, called Security Token, is then enetered on login page of the online provider along with User Id. Security token is decrypted on server side, and timestamp and RSA Signature is evaluated by RSA public key. Only owner of RSA Signature (private key) is able to create valid security token.\n[18] The System SSL module uses the z/OS Version 2 Release 1 ICSF PKCS #11 (hereafter referred to as \u00e2\u0080\u009cICSF PKCS #11\u00e2\u0080\u009d) with FIPS 140-2 Validation #2763 for certified cryptographic algorithms not available within the System SSL module (ie. random number generation) and hardware RSA signature verification and key wrapping.\n[19] The public and the private key-generation algorithm is the most complex part of RSA cryptography. Two large prime numbers, p and q, are generated using the Rabin-Miller primality test algorithm. A modulus n is calculated by multiplying p and q.any protocols like SSH, OpenPGP, S/MIME, and SSL / TLS rely on RSA for encryption and digital signature functions. It is also used in software programs -- browsers are an obvious example, which need to establish a secure connection over an insecure network like the Internet or validate a digital signature.\n[20] Quick recap: If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever used public key authentication, you probably have a file ~/.ssh/id_rsa or ~/.ssh/id_dsa in your home directory. This is your RSA/DSA private key, and ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub or ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub is its public key counterpart.\nSearch Query: rsa definition key.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Encryption is done on the client, while decryption is done on the managed file transfer server. But then RSA encrypts faster, while DSA decrypts faster.\n[2] You also agree that your personal information may be transferred and processed in the United States, and that you have read and agree to the Terms of Use and the Privacy Policy. RSA was first described in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Public-key cryptography, also known as asymmetric cryptography, uses two different but mathematically linked keys, one public and one private.\n[3] I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve just had a bit of a battle to get the RSA system Thoughworks use working on my Android phone, this is a quick \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat I did\u00e2\u0080\u009d post in case I ever have to do it again.

First of all, I contacted IT and was sent the software Key as a .sdtid file.\n[4] Definition - What does RSA Encryption mean? RSA encryption is a public-key encryption technology developed by RSA Data Security. The RSA algorithm is based on the difficulty in factoring very large numbers. Based on this principle, the RSA encryption algorithm uses prime factorization as the trap door for encryption. Deducing an RSA key, therefore, takes a huge amount of time and processing power. RSA is the standard encryption method for important data, especially data that's transmitted over the Internet.\n[5] RSA SecurID, formerly referred to as SecurID, is a mechanism developed by Security Dynamics (later RSA Security and now RSA, The Security Division of EMC) for performing two-factor authentication for a user to a network resource.s of 2003, RSA SecurID commanded over 70% of the two-factor authentication market and 25 million devices have been produced to date. A number of competitors, such as VASCO, make similar security tokens, mostly based on the open OATH HOTP standard.\n[6] DER encoded RSA private key; PEM; Identification . A key file is plain text, with base64-encoded payload data. It contains a line that reads -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----. Examples . To view the contents of a key, using OpenSSL: openssl rsa -noout -text -in example.key (This mostly just prints out opaque numbers, but note that the modulus can be used to determine whether the key corresponds to a particular certificate.) To generate a new private key:\n[7] RSA Data Security Digital Signature Process. In the RSA digital signature process, the private key is used to encrypt only the message digest. The encrypted message digest becomes the digital signature and is attached to the original data. Figure 14.7 illustrates the basic RSA Data Security digital signature process.\n[8] From Linux groups ; ) DSA is faster in signing, but slower in verifying. A DSA key of the same strength as RSA (1024 bits) generates a smaller signature. An RSA 512 bit key has been cracked, but only a 280 DSA key.\n[9] Commerce Server 2002. In Commerce Server 2002, asymmetric encryption is done using the RSA public-key key exchange algorithm. The key length is 512 bits, and the Cryptographic Service Provider (CSP) used is Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider.\n[10] RSA On line Certificate SITHFAB002, SITHFAB009, online rsa, rsa certificate, rsa certificate online, rsa, responsible service of alcohol, online rsa training, Australia, SITHFAB201, rto, registered training organisation, onlinersa, web based rsa, serving of alcohol training, in class, classroom, cert, RSA WA, RSA SA, RSA VIC, RSA TAS, RSA NT, RSA Course.\n[11] Invented more than 20 years ago, the so-called RSA cryptosystem is widely used to provide privacy for electronic mail, ensure authenticity of digital data, and handle credit-card payments on the Internet.\n[12] A public-key encryption technology developed by RSA Data Security, Inc.

The other key must be kept private. It is based on the fact that finding the factors of a integer is hard (the factoring problem). RSA stands for Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman, who first publicly described it in 1978.\n[9] RSA has major operations in the UK & Ireland, Scandinavia, Canada,and Latin America and provides insurance products and services in more than 140 countries through a network of local partners. It has 17 million customers. RSA was formed by the merger of Sun Alliance and Royal Insurance in 1996.RSA is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.un Alliance went on to acquire London Assurance in 1965 (becoming Sun Alliance & London) and Phoenix Assurance in 1984. Royal Insurance was founded in 1845. It acquired Liverpool & London and Globe Insurance Company in 1919.\n[10] Details on the algorithm can be found in various places. RSA is combined with the SHA1 hashing function to sign a message in this signature suite. It must be infeasible for anyone to either find a message that hashes to a given value or to find two messages that hash to the same value. If either were feasible, an intruder could attach a false message onto Alice's signature.\n[11] Definition - What does RSA Encryption mean? RSA encryption is a public-key encryption technology developed by RSA Data Security. The RSA algorithm is based on the difficulty in factoring very large numbers. Based on this principle, the RSA encryption algorithm uses prime factorization as the trap door for encryption. Deducing an RSA key, therefore, takes a huge amount of time and processing power. RSA is the standard encryption method for important data, especially data that's transmitted over the Internet.\n[12] You also agree that your personal information may be transferred and processed in the United States, and that you have read and agree to the Terms of Use and the Privacy Policy. RSA was first described in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Public-key cryptography, also known as asymmetric cryptography, uses two different but mathematically linked keys, one public and one private.\n[13] Invented more than 20 years ago, the so-called RSA cryptosystem is widely used to provide privacy for electronic mail, ensure authenticity of digital data, and handle credit-card payments on the Internet.\n[14] Techopedia explains RSA Encryption. RSA encryption is a public key encryption technology developed by RSA Data Security, which licenses the algorithm technologies and also sells the development kits. RSA is built into many common software products, including Microsoft's Internet Explorer.\n[15] Many protocols like SSH, OpenPGP, S/MIME, and SSL / TLS rely on RSA for encryption and digital signature functions. It is also used in software programs -- browsers are an obvious example, which need to establish a secure connection over an insecure network like the Internet or validate a digital signature.\n[16] A public-key encryption technology developed by RSA Data Security, Inc.

Encryption is done on the client, while decryption is done on the managed file transfer server. But then RSA encrypts faster, while DSA decrypts faster.\n[18] RSA Data Security Digital Signature Process. In the RSA digital signature process, the private key is used to encrypt only the message digest. The encrypted message digest becomes the digital signature and is attached to the original data. Figure 14.7 illustrates the basic RSA Data Security digital signature process.\n[19] Commerce Server 2002. In Commerce Server 2002, asymmetric encryption is done using the RSA public-key key exchange algorithm.

RSA is a public-key cryptosystem for both encryption and authentication; it was invented in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman [RSA78]. It works as follows: take two large primes, p and q, and find their product n = pq ; n is called the modulus.\n[5] This is sometimes referred to as certificate authentication, but certificates are just one of many ways to use public key technology. One of the core decisions in this field is the key size. Most people have heard that 1024 bit RSA keys have been cracked and are not used any more for web sites or PGP. The next most fashionable number after 1024 appears to be 2048, but a lot of people have also been skipping that and moving to 4096 bit keys.\n[6] Your signature key and your encryption key are the same (of type RSA). You have one certificate for your one public key. (That's the most common case.) You have two distinct keys for signatures and for encryption; each public key is distributed in its own certificate. You have a key for signatures, and the public key is in a certificate signed by a regular CA.\n[7] The RSA cryptosystem is the most widely-used public key cryptography algorithm in the world.

RSA is known as a public key encryption system, meaning that many people can use it to encode information, but only the person who holds the key (or knows the value of the two prime numbers) can decode it again.\n[16] What is RSA? RSA is a public-key cryptosystem for both encryption and authentication; it was invented in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman [RSA78]. It works as follows: take two large primes, p and q, and find their product n = pq ; n is called the modulus.\n[17] RSA Conference is a cryptography and information security-related conference.

A goal for most patients on mechanical ventilation is to be weaned from the ventilator. The weaning process is highly dependent on the patient's pathology, but the final common pathway to ventilator independence always includes at least one trial of spontaneous breathing. Trials of spontaneous breathing have been shown to accurately predict the success of spontaneous breathing.\n[6] Apr 3, 2014 \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Ventilators are covered by Medicare for the treatment of neuromuscular \u00e2\u0080\u00a6. 1 The. rates listed are based on the Medicare 2015 DMEPOS National Fee Schedule.\n[7] A wide range of home care ventilators (HCV) are now available for long-term mechanical ventilation [4\u00e2\u0080\u00937].

In general, mode selection is based on clinician familiarity and institutional preferences, since there is a paucity of evidence indicating that the mode affects clinical outcome.\n[18] There are two main modes of mechanical ventilation within the two divisions: positive pressure ventilation, where air (or another gas mix) is pushed into the trachea, and negative pressure ventilation, where air is, in essence, sucked into the lungs.echanical ventilation is indicated when the patient's spontaneous ventilation is inadequate to maintain life. It is also indicated as prophylaxis for imminent collapse of other physiologic functions, or ineffective gas exchange in the lungs.\n[19] The application of mechanical ventilatory support through a mask in place of endotracheal intubation is becoming increasingly accepted and used in the emergency department. Considering this modality for patients with mild-to-moderate respiratory failure is appropriate.\n[20] Mechanical ventilation is often a life-saving intervention, but carries many potential complications including pneumothorax, airway injury, alveolar damage, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.. In many healthcare systems prolonged ventilation as part of intensive care is a limited resource (in that there are only\nSearch Query: medicare's definition of mechanical ventilation.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

A mode of mechanical respiration in which all breaths are mandatory and are either patient or machine triggered, and machine cycled; a minimum breathing rate is set but the patient can trigger breaths at a faster pace.\n[2] Mechanical ventilation is termed invasive if it involves any instrument penetrating through the mouth (such as an endo tracheal tube) or the skin (such as a tracheostomy tube).his may involve a machine called a ventilator or the breathing may be assisted by a registered nurse, physician, physician assistant, respiratory therapist, paramedic, or other suitable person compressing a bag or set of bellows.\n[3] Mechanical ventilation is indicated when the patient's spontaneous ventilation is inadequate to maintain life. It is also indicated as prophylaxis for imminent collapse of other physiologic functions, or ineffective gas exchange in the lungs.\n[4] Mechanical ventilation, in the healthcare setting or home, helps patients breathe by assisting the inhalation of oxygen into the lungs and the exhalation of carbon dioxide. Depending on the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s condition, mechanical ventilation can help support or completely control breathing.\n[5] Summary Mechanical ventilation, applied either invasively through a tracheotomy tube or noninvasively via a mask, is increasingly used for long-term management of many forms of severe chronic respiratory failure in the home setting.\n[6] Mechanical ventilation. Assisted ventilation could be defined as the movement of gas into and out of lungs by an external source connected directly to the patient. The external source could be the resuscitation bag, continuous distending pressure device or a mechanical ventilator.\n[7] Ventilators are medical devices that provide mechanical ventilation to assist with or replace patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 spontaneous breathing. Mechanical ventilation is often categorized based on the interface used, such as a tracheostomy tube for invasive ventilation, or a mask for non-invasive ventilation.\n[8] Mechanical ventilation is indicated when the patient's spontaneous ventilation is inadequate to sustain life. In addition, it is indicated as a measure to control ventilation in critically ill patients and as prophylaxis for impending collapse of other physiologic functions. second possible advantage of this mode of mechanical ventilation is that cycling the ventilator into the inspiratory phase maintains normal ventilatory activity and, therefore, prevents atrophy of the respiratory muscles.\n[9] Mechanical ventilation can be noninvasive, involving various types of face masks, or invasive, involving endotracheal intubation (see Airway Establishment and Control : Endotracheal tubes). Selection and use of appropriate techniques require an understanding of respiratory mechanics.\n[10] Nasotracheal intubation In medicine, mechanical ventilation is a method to mechanically assist or replace spontaneous breathing. Mechanical ventilation is typically used after an invasive intubation, a procedure wherein an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube is inserted into the airway.\n[11] Mechanical ventilation systems come in a variety of forms. Almost all systems use a machine called a ventilator that pushes air through a tube for delivery to the patient's airways. The air may be delivered through a nasal or face mask, or through an opening in the trachea (windpipe), called a tracheostomy.\n[12] Mechanical ventilation can be noninvasive, involving various types of face masks, or invasive, involving endotracheal intubation (see Endotracheal tubes). Selection and use of appropriate techniques require an understanding of respiratory mechanics.\n[13] Advance Directives (Mechanical ventilation enables the client to breathe and prolongs survival, but it will not alter progression of the disease. For this reason, many clients elect not to be placed on a mechanical ventilator, according to their wishes or advance directives).\n[14] Mechanical ventilation can be noninvasive, involving various types of face masks, or invasive, involving endotracheal intubation (see Tracheal Intubation). Selection and use of appropriate techniques require an understanding of respiratory mechanics.\n[15] Mechanical ventilation is among the most common interventions in the intensive care unit (ICU). Over the last two decades, numerous studies have investigated methods to improve outcomes of patients receiving mechanical ventilation.\n[16] Numerous decisions need to be made once it is determined that a patient requires mechanical ventilation, including the mode of mechanical ventilation. The mode refers to the method of inspiratory support.\n[17] This form of mechanical ventilation includes pressure control ventilation (PCV), pressure support ventilation (PSV), and several noninvasive modalities applied via a tight-fitting face mask. In all of these modalities, the ventilator delivers a set inspiratory pressure.\n[18] From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Modes of mechanical ventilation are one of the most important aspects of the usage of mechanical ventilation. The mode refers to the method of inspiratory support.\n[19] Mechanical ventilation utilizes several separate systems for ventilation referred to as the mode. Modes come in many different delivery concepts but all modes fall into one of three categories; volume-cycled, pressure-cycled, spontaneously cycled.\n[20] Indications for mechanical ventilation, ventila-tor associated pneumonia (VAP) and liberation from mechanical ventilationare beyond the scope of this article.Perhaps one of the most confusing aspects of mechanical ventilation isthe plethora of terms and acronyms that are used.\nSearch Query: medicare's definition of mechanical ventilation.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Last Editorial Review: 5/13/2016.\n[3] Mechanical ventilation. For the use in architecture and climate control, see Ventilation (architecture). Mechanical ventilation is the medical term for artificial ventilation where mechanical means is used to assist or replace spontaneous breathing.\n[4] Mechanical ventilation is a life support treatment. A mechanical. ventilator is a machine that helps people breathe when they are not. able to breathe enough on their own. The mechanical ventilator is. also called a ventilator, respirator, or breathing machine. Most. patients who need support from a ventilator because of a severe. illness are cared for in a hospital\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intensive care unit (ICU).\n[5] Mechanical ventilation may be defined as the use of a mechanical device to provide. ventilator support for patients. There are 2 types of mechanical ventilation: positive and. negative pressure ventilation. Positive pressure ventilation delivers a positive pressure to. inflate the lungs. Expiration is passive.\n[6] What Is Mechanical Ventilation? Mechanical ventilation, in the healthcare setting or home, helps patients breathe by assisting the inhalation of oxygen into the lungs and the exhalation of carbon dioxide.

Mechanical ventilation provides the force needed to deliver air to the lungs in a patient whose own ventilatory abilities are diminished or lost. Breathing requires the movement of air into and out of the lungs. This is normally accomplished by the diaphragm and chest muscles. A variety of medical conditions can impair the ability of these muscles to accomplish this task, including: muscular dystrophies.\n[11] Mechanical ventilation is indicated when the patient's spontaneous ventilation is inadequate to maintain life.

An example of such a function is the function to generate the n th term of the Fibonacci sequence.\n[9] Definition and Examples. A function f is linear if it can be expressed in the form. f ( x) =mx +b. where m and b are constants and x is an arbitrary member of the domain of f. Often the. relationship between two variables x and y is a linear function expressed as an. equation y =mx +b. Examples:\n[10] Any function whose graph is a straight line. linear function (Noun). Any function whose value on the sum of two elements is the sum of the values of the function on the two elements and whose value on the product of a scalar times an element is the scalar times the value of the function on the element.\n[11] The graph of f is a line with slope m and y intercept b. Note: A function f (x) = b, where b is a constant real number is called a constant function. Its graph is a horizontal line at y = b. Example 1: Graph the linear function f given by.\n[12] Key Questions. What is an example of a linear equation written in function notation? We can do more than giving an example of a linear equation: we can give the expression of every possible linear function. A function is said to be linear if the dipendent and the indipendent variable grow with constant ratio.\n[13] For a above 1: 1 As x increases, f(x) heads to infinity. 2 As x decreases, f(x) heads to 0. 3 it is a Strictly Increasing function (and so is Injective). 4 It has a Horizontal Asymptote along the x-axis (y=0).\n[14] Example 2: Find the average rate of change of from 3 to 0. Since the average rate of change of a function is the slope of the associated line we have already done the work in the last problem.That is, the average rate of change of from 3 to 0 is 1. That is, over the interval [0,3], for every 1 unit change in x, there is a 1 unit change in the value of the function.Here is a graph of the function, the two points used, and the line connecting those two points.xample 2: Find the average rate of change of from 3 to 0. Since the average rate of change of a function is the slope of the associated line we have already done the work in the last problem.\n[15] Monotonicity criterion. This article is about a voting system criterion. For the mathematical notion of an order preserving mapping, see monotonic function. The monotonicity criterion is a voting system criterion used to evaluate both single and multiple winner ranked voting systems.\n[16] Here is the graph for this function. This function has an absolute maximum of eight at and an absolute minimum of negative eight at. This function has no relative extrema. So, a function doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to have relative extrema as this example has shown.\n[17] 1 As x increases, f(x) heads to infinity. 2 As x decreases, f(x) heads to 0. 3 it is a Strictly Increasing function (and so is Injective). 4 It has a Horizontal Asymptote along the x-axis (y=0).\n[18] For example, (1, 2) is on the graph of f (x) , (1, 4) is on the graph of f (x) + 2, and (1, 0) is on the graph of f (x) - 2. Graphs of f (x) , f (x) + 2, and f (x) - 2. While adding to the input increases the function in the y direction, adding to the input decreases the function in the x direction.\n[19] If x were -11, the relation would still be a function : { (12, 13), (-11, 22) , (33, 101), (-11 ,22) }. The all important rule for a function in math -- that each value in the domain has only 1 value in the range-- would still be true if we had a second copy of 1 ordered pair.\n[20] Notice that the changes focus around the x-values of 1 and -1. \u00e2\u0099\u00a6 Hint: When graphing, focus on where the changes in the graph occur. From x-values of -\u00e2\u0088\u009e to -1, the graph is a straight line. From x-values of -1 to 1, the graph is constant. From x-values 1 to \u00e2\u0088\u009e, the graph is quadratic (part of a parabola). The piecewise function shown in this example is continuous (there are no gaps or breaks in the plotting). In this example, the domain is all Reals since all x-values have a plotted value.\nSearch Query: example of monotonic function.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Solution: The graph is exponential decay because the base is between 0 and 1. It has a positive initial value, so the graph is always positive and has a horizontal asymptote at y=0.\n[2] By definition: A function is strictly decreasing on an interval, if when x1 < x2, then f (x1) > f (x2). If the function notation is bothering you, this definition can also be thought of as stating x1 < x2 implies y1 > y2. As the x's get larger the y's get smaller.\n[3] Graph A: This graph is symmetric about its axis; that is, it is symmetric about the line x = 3. There is no other symmetry. This graph shows a function.\n[4] Given any sequence we have the following. 1 We call the sequence increasing if for every n. 2 We call the sequence decreasing if for every n. 3 If is an increasing sequence or is a decreasing sequence we call it monotonic. If there exists a number m such that for every n we say the sequence is bounded below.\n[5] So the graph of f(x)=ax when the base is smaller than 1 slopes down as. it moves to the right, but it is always positive. As it moves to the left, the. graph grows tall very quickly. One-to-one and onto. Recall that an exponential function f : R ! (0,1) has as its domain the. set R and has as its target the set (0,1). We see from the graph of f(x)=ax, if either a>1or0<a<1, that f(x) is one-to-one and onto.\n[6] From x-values of -\u00e2\u0088\u009e to -1, the graph is a straight line.

Summary. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve explored a few different kinds of nonlinear functions. Like linear functions, inverse relation, quadratic, and exponential functions can help us model real world situations and understand them better.\n[10] Geometrically, such functions are symmetric about the origin.

We must look at f(\u00e2\u0088\u0092x):\n[2] The constant can be characterized in many different ways. For example, e can be defined as the unique positive number a such that the graph of the function y = ax has unit slope at x = 0. The function f(x) = ex is called the (natural) exponential function. The natural logarithm, or logarithm to base e, is the inverse function to the natural exponential function.\n[3] Equivalently, a function is convex if its epigraph (the set of points on or above the graph of the function) is a convex set. Well-known examples of convex functions are the quadratic function and the exponential function for any real number x. Every real-valued linear transformation is convex but not strictly convex, since if f is linear, then This statement also holds if we replace convex by concave. 2 Every real-valued affine function, i.e., each function of the form, is simultaneously convex and concave.\n[4] Examples of the following types of functions are shown in this gallery: 1 linear. 2 quadratic. 3 power. polynomial. 4 rational. exponential. 5 logarithmic. sinusoidal.\n[5] Another way of saying this is that a logarithmic function and its inverse are symmetrical with respect to the line y = x. Work through the following examples. Example 1: Find the inverse of .\n[6] So really what a step function is at one example is the greatest integer function which is basically looking at a number line and picking the greatest integer less than or equal to whatever number you are given.\n[7] Increasing Functions. A function is increasing when the y-value increases as the x-value increases, like this: It is easy to see that y=f(x) tends to go up as it goes along.\n[8] By definition: A function is strictly increasing on an interval, if when x1 < x2, then f (x1) < f (x2). If the function notation is bothering you, this definition can also be thought of as stating x1 < x2 implies y1 < y2. As the x's get larger, the y's get larger.\n[9] example 4 use the result of example 3 to find the average rate of change of from 3 to 6 solution the average rate function of change of from 3 to x is so the average rate of change of from 3 to 6 is a 6 9 3 3\n[10] Linear functions can be written in slope-intercept form as, y (x) = mx + b. We can use the slope-intercept form of a line to demonstrate that a linear function has a constant rate of change. To see this, consider a one unit increase in x (i.e. from x to x + 1).\n[11] By definition: A function is strictly decreasing on an interval, if when x1 < x2, then f (x1) > f (x2). If the function notation is bothering you, this definition can also be thought of as stating x1 < x2 implies y1 > y2. As the x's get larger the y's get smaller.\n[12] Given any sequence we have the following. 1 We call the sequence increasing if for every n. 2 We call the sequence decreasing if for every n. 3 If is an increasing sequence or is a decreasing sequence we call it monotonic. If there exists a number m such that for every n we say the sequence is bounded below.\n[13] For example, Rudin, in his Principles of Mathematical Analysis (Definition 3.13), defines a sequence $\\{s_n\\}$ of real numbers to be: (a) monotonically increasing if $s_n \\leq s_{n+1}, (n = 1, 2, 3, \\cdots)$ [i.e., non-decreasing].o. $x(0)=0, x(1)=0, x(2)=1$ is non-decreasing, but not monotonically increasing. It is monotonically increasing if $x(1)=0.5$ instead, for example.\n[14] 1 As x increases, f(x) heads to 0. 2 As x decreases, f(x) heads to infinity. 3 It is a Strictly Decreasing function (and so is Injective). 4 It has a Horizontal Asymptote along the x-axis (y=0).\n[15] For a above 1: 1 As x increases, f(x) heads to infinity. 2 As x decreases, f(x) heads to 0. 3 it is a Strictly Increasing function (and so is Injective). 4 It has a Horizontal Asymptote along the x-axis (y=0).\n[16] 1 As x increases, f(x) heads to infinity. 2 As x decreases, f(x) heads to 0. 3 it is a Strictly Increasing function (and so is Injective). 4 It has a Horizontal Asymptote along the x-axis (y=0).\n[17] EXAMPLE 3: Problem: Graph the function. Solution: The graph is exponential decay because the base is between 0 and 1. It has a positive initial value, so the graph is always positive and has a horizontal asymptote at y=0.\n[18] So the graph of f(x)=ax when the base is smaller than 1 slopes down as. it moves to the right, but it is always positive. As it moves to the left, the. graph grows tall very quickly. One-to-one and onto. Recall that an exponential function f : R ! (0,1) has as its domain the. set R and has as its target the set (0,1). We see from the graph of f(x)=ax, if either a>1or0<a<1, that f(x) is one-to-one and onto.\n[19] The graph of the function is a straight line, the constant function f(x) = 1. The graph of the function is concave down and f(x) \u00e2\u0086\u0092 \u00e2\u0088\u009e as x \u00e2\u0086\u0092 \u00e2\u0088\u009e. If p = 1, the power function reduces to the linear function f(x) = x. This case separates the behavior of f(x) = xp for 0 < p < 1 and p > 1.\n[20] In Function 2, the graph is a straight line, so it is a linear function. Summary. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve explored a few different kinds of nonlinear functions. Like linear functions, inverse relation, quadratic, and exponential functions can help us model real world situations and understand them better.\nSearch Query: example of monotonic function.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

For a function f: R \u00e2\u0086\u0092 R, this definition merely states that for every z between x and y, the point (z, f (z)) on the graph of f is above the straight line joining the points (x, f (x)) and (y, f (y)). Any affine function is both (non-strictly) concave and convex. 2 The sine function is concave on the interval. 3 The function, where is the determinant of a nonnegative-definite matrix B, is concave. 4 Practical example: rays bending in computation of radiowave attenuation in the atmosphere.\n[2] It is the slope of the line. Since the average rate of change is positive and constant, this. tells us that the function values are increasing over the given intervals. Remember to read graphs from left to right. f(x)=2x\u00e2\u0088\u00921 is a linear function and therefore has a constant average rate of change.\n[3] Example.

In the case of the maximum, the slope of the tangent is decreasing -- it is going from positive to negative. We can see that at the points C, A, D. Example 2.\n[7] Non-linear functions Linear functions are easy to identify as increasing, decreasing, or constant because they are a straight line.

A function is monotonic on an interval I if it is only increasing or only decreasing on I. The derivative can help us determine whether a function is increasing or decreasing on an interval.

Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: example of monotonic function.\n\n[1] Monotonic Function. Monotonic functions are the functions which maintained the order of functions value. As we all know that the variation in independent value also make the variation in functions value. A suitable example for this is monotonic functions or linear polynomials. The monotonic functions maintains the straight line in linear programming graph. This is also called the monotonic nature over the domain and real numbers. A monotonic function increases and decreases over the interval.\n[2] Montonic Function. When a function is increasing on its entire domain or decreasing on its entire domain, we say that the function is strictly monotonic, and we call it a monotonic function. For example, consider the function g(x) equals x 3: Notice the graph of g is increasing everywhere. Therefore, this is a monotonic function.\n[3] Monotonic Function. A monotonic function is a function which is either entirely nonincreasing or nondecreasing. A function is monotonic if its first derivative (which need not be continuous) does not change sign.\n[4] To solidify our understanding of what a monotonic function is, let's consider what a non-monotonic function is. A non-monotonic function is a function that is increasing and decreasing on different intervals of its domain. For example, consider our initial example f(x) equals x 2.\n[5] monotonic function. Monotonic Function. (or monotone function), a function whose increments \u00ce\u0094f(x) = f(x\u00e2\u0080\u00b2) \u00e2\u0088\u0092 f(x) do not change sign when \u00ce\u0094x = x\u00e2\u0080\u00b2 \u00e2\u0088\u0092 x > 0; that is, the increments are either always nonnegative or always nonpositive. Somewhat inaccurately, a monotonic function can be defined as a function that always varies in the same direction.\n[6] Here's the definition of the monotonic function from Wikipedia: In calculus, a function f defined on a subset of the real numbers with real values is called monotonic (also monotonically increasing, increasing or non-decreasing), if for all x and y such that x \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 y one has f(x) \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 f(y), so f preserves the order.\n[7] In mathematics, a monotonic function (or monotone function) is a function between ordered sets that preserves or reverses the given order. This concept first arose in calculus, and was later generalized to the more abstract setting of order theory. 1 Monotonicity in calculus and analysis.\n[8] I've never heard of monotonic being used for two (input) variables, but I suppose it would mean that, for each fixed value of y, u is a monotonic function of x, and for each fixed value of x, u is a monotonic function of y (and I expect they'd need to be either both monotonic increasing or both monotonic decreasing).\n[9] An important application of monotonic functions is in probability theory. If is a random variable, its cumulative distribution function is a monotonically increasing function. A function is unimodal if it is monotonically increasing up to some point (the mode) and then monotonically decreasing. When is a strictly monotonic function, then is injective on its domain, and if is the range of, then there is an inverse function on for.\n[10] Figure 1.

However, recent data confirms that anyone of any age or rank. can become susceptible to suicide.\n[3] That equates to an annual suicide rate of 29.5 per 100,000 veterans, or roughly 50% higher than the rate among other civilians with similar demographic characteristics. Advertisement The issue of veteran suicide has become a political cause for activists and legislators.\n[4] For other uses, see Suicide (disambiguation). Suicide is the act of intentionally causing one's own death. Risk factors include mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, personality disorders, alcoholism, or substance misuse. Others are impulsive acts due to stress such as from financial difficulties, troubles with relationships, or from bullying.\n[5] 10 most extreme places on Earth. The most common causes of teenage suicide include depression, substance abuse, and social isolation. Teen suicide risk factors include psychological disorders, feelings of worthlessness, a family history of suicide, bullying, and physical and sexual abuse.\n[6] A large number of suicides and suicide attempts. are related to treatable emotional conditions including depression and other mood disorders as well as. alcohol and drug abuse. People often want to conceal their suicidal thoughts, depression, or alcohol and. drug abuse.\n[7] In 2006, the army stopped letting soldiers take their service weapons home on weekends. The suicide rate fell there, too, by 40 percent. The high rate of gun suicides in the United States is not a new problem. Even in the 1980s and 1990s, when violent crime rates were much higher, gun suicides were still a more common cause of death than gun murders.\n[8] DoD: Military suicide rate declining. By Patricia Kime, Staff Writer 4:01 p.m. EST January 16, 2015. The 2013 Defense Department Suicide Event Report shows the suicide rate for troops on active duty in 2013 was 18.7 percent, down 18 percent from the 2012 rate of 22.7 per 100,000.(Photo: Defense Department).he 2013 Defense Department Suicide Event Report shows the suicide rate for troops on active duty in 2013 was 18.7 percent, down 18 percent from the 2012 rate of 22.7 per 100,000.\n[9] If you are a Veteran or know a Veteran who is experiencing any of these signs, call the Veterans Crisis Line immediately. Responders are standing by to help. You can also learn to identify and understand risk factors for suicide. Identifying the Signs Many Veterans may not show any signs of intent to harm themselves before doing so, but some actions can be a sign that a Veteran needs help.\n[10] The number of suicides in the United States rose 11 percent from 2007 to 2010, the VA said. The VA did not provide raw data and acknowledged its national figures were still estimates. The new study was based on data collected from 21 states in which military status is reported on the death certificate.\n[11] The Start of the Suicide Story.

It was nine years ago \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Columbus Day, 2003 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that the first significant story on the suicides of the post-9/11 wars appeared above the fold in USA Today. Reporter Gregg Zoroya had called me that summer, when I was doing a fellowship at the Uniformed Services University at the Health Sciences.\n[12] The author also stresses that, according to statistics from different authors, it is estimated that 75% of suicide cases have. depression as their main cause. For Missel,4 women suffer twice as more from depression than men.\n[13] Stress, confusion, pressure and worries about self-worth are common problems in many teens that can trigger suicide, according to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Teens may have to go through parental divorce, moving in with a new family, living in a new location or going to a different school.\n[14] Top 10 facts about the world. The most common causes of teenage suicide include depression, substance abuse, and social isolation. Teen suicide risk factors include psychological disorders, feelings of worthlessness, a family history of suicide, bullying, and physical and sexual abuse.\n[15] SAMHSA provides suicide prevention information and other helpful resources to behavioral health professionals, the general public, and people at risk. Suicide is a serious public health problem that causes immeasurable pain, suffering, and loss to individuals, families, and communities nationwide. The causes of suicide are complex and determined by multiple combinations of factors, such as mental illness, substance abuse, painful losses, exposure to violence, and social isolation.\n[16] The new arithmetic shows that from 2006 forward \u00e2\u0080\u0094 during the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the true suicide rate across the U.S. military was actually several tenths of a percent to 1% or more higher than what was being reported.\n[17] Risk factors for suicide vary by age, gender, and ethnic group. And risk factors often occur in combinations. Over 90% of people who die by suicide have clinical depression or another diagnosable mental disorder. Many times, people who die by suicide have an alcohol or substance abuse problem. Often they have that problem in combination with other mental disorders.\n[18] Risk Factors for Suicide.

Understanding and knowledge of these conditions is vital for developing appropriate public policies and responses to protect the public.DELAIDE: Suicide bombing attacks have become a weapon of choice among terrorist groups because of their lethality and ability to cause mayhem and fear. Though depressing, the almost daily news reports of deaths caused by suicide attacks rarely explain what motivates the attackers.\n[7] And in some cases, the services relaxed age restrictions, allowing older people to enlist or rejoin the military. But as the wars dragged on and suicides, sexual assaults and other bad behavior by service members spiked, military leaders began to question whether there was a link to the relaxed enlistment standards.\n[8] New report on 2013 U.S. military suicides finds rate dropped among active duty by 18 percent.he 2013 Defense Department Suicide Event Report shows the suicide rate for troops on active duty in 2013 was 18.7 percent, down 18 percent from the 2012 rate of 22.7 per 100,000.\n[9] The Army was hit hardest by the most common and long-lasting problems \u00e2\u0080\u0094 post-traumatic stress disorder, major depression, bipolar disorder, alcohol dependence and substance dependence, according to the report.\n[10] The common stimulus (or information input) in suicide is intolerable psychological pain. Excruciating negative emotions - including shame, guilt, anger, fear, and sadness - frequently serve as the foundation for self-destructive behavior. These emotions may arise from any number of sources.\n[11] Military service members, veterans, and their families are a growing community exposed to traumatic events. Involvement in combat that causes losses and fears; injuries associated with combat; repeated deployments and/or relocations; and military sexual violence\u00e2\u0080\u0094all may exert an emotional toll on military personnel, their families, and their communities.\n[12] The Task Force found that the most typical profile for a Navy suicide involves an enlisted white. male between the ages of 17-24. However, recent data confirms that anyone of any age or rank. can become susceptible to suicide.\n[13] That equates to an annual suicide rate of 29.5 per 100,000 veterans, or roughly 50% higher than the rate among other civilians with similar demographic characteristics.

And risk factors often occur in combinations. Over 90% of people who die by suicide have clinical depression or another diagnosable mental disorder. Many times, people who die by suicide have an alcohol or substance abuse problem. Often they have that problem in combination with other mental disorders.\n[16] Risk Factors for Suicide.

The AP cites the Pentagon as saying the civilian suicide rate for males aged 17-60 was 25 per 100,000 in 2010, the latest year for which such statistics are available.\n[8] The data was then compared with a previous investigation \u00e2\u0080\u0093 primarily an estimation \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that had been conducted over the same time period, and had found a suicide rate of 18 per day. Many of these suicides involve older veterans; 69 percent of the suicides recorded were by veterans age 50 and older. But another way to look at this is that 31 percent of these suicides were by veterans 49 and younger. In other words,by men in the prime of life. And then there are the shockingly common active duty suicides. Just two weeks ago, the military released data showing that suicides among those on active duty hit a record high in 2012. There were 349 suicides among active duty personnel \u00e2\u0080\u0093 almost one a day. That means there are now more suicides among active duty soldiers than there are combat deaths.\n[9] Suicide is the act of taking one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own life. It is one of the top causes of death in America. According to the latest statistics published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), suicide was the tenth leading cause of death in 2009 (CDC, 2009). Depression is not the only risk factor for suicide. Several risk factors contribute to thoughts of suicide, attempted suicide, and actual suicide. They include: 1 previous suicide attempts. 2 depression. 3 substance abuse (often accompanying an underlying mental disorder). 4 mental disorders. 5 incarceration.\n[10] Mental illness may cause someone to feel that they do not belong and are a burden.

Suicide rate among recent veterans 50% higher than non-military civilians. Recent veterans have committed suicide at a much higher rate than people who never served in the military, according to a new analysis that provides the most thorough accounting so far of the problem.\n[2] Suicide Prevention. According to the January 2014 Veterans Health Administration report (PDF | 855 KB), the suicide rate among male and female veterans and military service members exceeds the national rate for the general population. Veterans comprise 20% of national suicides, with approximately 22 veterans dying by suicide every day.\n[3] Veteran suicide numbers have gone up in recent years with much of the attention focused on veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan killing themselves. However, almost seven out of 10 veterans who have committed suicide were over the age of 50, according to a Department of Veterans Affairs study.\n[4] Suicide itself is not a mental disorder, but one of the most important causes of suicide is mental illness \u00e2\u0080\u0093 most often Depression, Bipolar Disorder (Manic Depression), Schizophrenia, and Substance Use Disorders. In Canada approximately 200 youth between the ages of 15 and 24 years die by suicide (Statistics Canada, CANISM, table 102-0551).\n[5] Here are some key suicide risk factors: 1 A recent or serious loss. This might include the death of a family member, a friend or a pet. The separation or a divorce of parents, or a breakup with a boyfriend or a girlfriend, can also be felt as a profound loss, along with a parent losing a job, or the family losing their home.\n[6] Most of the 22 military veteran suicides that occur each day do not involve\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 (Rick Loomis / Los Angeles\u00e2\u0080\u00a6) In most discussions of suicide and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including the online buzz that followed publication of a Times analysis on how young California veterans die \u00e2\u0080\u0094 one statistic gets repeated most: 22 veterans kill themselves each day.\n[7] Suicide among males is four times higher than among females. In adults, separation or divorce raises the risk of suicide attempts. In young people, physical or sexual abuse and disruptive behavior increase vulnerability. Cut it however you want: In places where exposure to guns is higher, more people die of suicide. 1 Deborah Azrael, associate director of the Harvard Youth Violence Prevention Center. 2 Matthew Miller, associate director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center.\n[8] The highest rate of suicide completion occurs among older white males, many with a history of depression, substance abuse, or both (Bruce et al. Another contributing risk factor for suicide completion is alienation from social support (Cash & Bridge, 2009; Taylor, Gooding, Wood, & Tarrier, 2011).\n[9] One of the main causes of suicide in the socio-cultural category is the feeling of being isolated or not being accepted by others. Feelings of isolation can be caused by sexual orientation, religious beliefs, and gender identity. Other possible suicide catalysts from this category include: 1 difficulty seeking help.\n[10] Suicide Causes by Kevin Caruso Over 90 percent of people who die by suicide have a mental illness at the time of their death. And the most common mental illness is depression.

Suicide rates soared among soldiers who went to war in Iraq and Afghanistan and those who never left the United States, according to the largest study ever conducted on suicide in the military.\n[16] Among full-time soldiers, the suicide rate soared to 29.7 deaths per 100,000 in 2012, well above a 25.1-per-100,000 rate for civilians of a similar age group during 2010, the latest year available, according to a Pentagon report. Among male soldiers, the rate was 31.8-per-100,000.\n[17] Figures on the third quarters of 2015 and 2014 showed suicides in the active duty Navy increased to 11 from seven; in the active duty Air Force to 16 from 13; and in the active duty Army to 32 from 31. Through all of 2014, the number of suicides recorded for the active duty military was 273, and for the reserves it was 170, for a total of 443. Through the first three quarters of 2015, the number of suicides for active duty was 202 and the number for the reserves was 161, for a total of 363.\n[18] The data was then compared with a previous investigation \u00e2\u0080\u0093 primarily an estimation \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that had been conducted over the same time period, and had found a suicide rate of 18 per day. Many of these suicides involve older veterans; 69 percent of the suicides recorded were by veterans age 50 and older. But another way to look at this is that 31 percent of these suicides were by veterans 49 and younger. In other words,by men in the prime of life. And then there are the shockingly common active duty suicides. Just two weeks ago, the military released data showing that suicides among those on active duty hit a record high in 2012. There were 349 suicides among active duty personnel \u00e2\u0080\u0093 almost one a day. That means there are now more suicides among active duty soldiers than there are combat deaths.\n[19] That equates to an annual suicide rate of 29.5 per 100,000 veterans, or roughly 50% higher than the rate among other civilians with similar demographic characteristics.

In women, it is the second most common cause. Post-traumatic stress disorder, major depression, bipolar disorder, alcohol dependence and substance abuse are highly prevalent among former and active military personnel.\n[10] People are most driven to suicide when they view their current situation as being completely hopeless and feel as if they have no way to change things for the better. Common causes of suicide include: depression, drug abuse, financial problems, as well as difficulties with relationships.

We all realize the inherent stress and burdens placed upon our soldiers, civilians and their family members.\n[5] We suggest that moral injury is likely one of the most important factors in military suicide rates. Moral injury is not PTSD. The latter is a dysfunction of brain areas that suppress fear and integrate feeling with coherent memory; symptoms include flashbacks, nightmares, dissociative episodes and hyper-vigilance. PTSD is an immediate injury of trauma.\n[6] Most suicides happen among troops who have not seen combat.. But what about post-traumatic stress disorder? The study authors looked at PTSD as a factor but found that only nine of the 83 people who committed suicide -- about 10% -- had been diagnosed with PTSD or reported experiencing symptoms of PTSD.\n[7] Combat Fatalities not the Most Common Cause of Military Deaths.

Suicide Is Now the Leading Cause of Death Amongst Active-Duty Soldiers. In 2010, for the second year in a row, more American soldiers killed themselves than died in combat. Military officials knew they had an epidemic on their hands, but they didn't know how to mitigate the hyper-complex problem.\n[7] The largest study to date of a rising suicide rate among military personnel, published Wednesday in JAMA Psychiatry, found no connection between suicide and deployment overseas in support of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.he study found that the suicide rate for troops who left the military before completing a four-year enlistment was nearly twice that of troops who stayed. The rate for troops who were involuntarily discharged under less-than-honorable conditions for disciplinary infractions was nearly three times higher.\n[8] War was the leading cause of death in the military nearly every year between 2004 and 2011 until suicides became the top means of dying for troops in 2012 and 2013, according to a bar chart published this week in a monthly Pentagon medical statistical analysis journal.\n[9] When researchers asked 72 soldiers at Fort Carson, Colo., why they tried to kill themselves, out of the 33 reasons they had to choose from, all of the soldiers included one in particular \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a desire to end intense emotional distress.\n[10] View. comments. The number of suicides among America's troops, averaging nearly one a day this year, has become the second leading cause of death among the military at the fastest pace in the nation's decade of war.\n[11] Suicide rates in the military were traditionally lower than among civilians in the same age range, but in 2004 the suicide rate in the U.S. Army began to climb, surpassing the civilian rate in 2008. Substance use is involved in many of these suicides. The 2010 report of the Army Suicide Prevention Task Force found that 29 percent of active duty Army suicides from fiscal year (FY) 2005 to FY 2009 involved alcohol or drug use; and in 2009, prescription drugs were involved in almost one third of them.\n[12] The United States military veteran suicide epidemic is an ongoing phenomenon regarding a reported high rate of suicide among U.S. military veterans, in comparison to the general public.n 2012, 177 active-duty soldiers committed suicide, conversely 176 soldiers were killed in combat. In other words, more soldiers committed suicide compared to being killed in action. In 2012, the study concluded that Army had the highest number of suicides compared to any other service branch.\n[13] Meanwhile, a new Pentagon analysis released Tuesday shows that suicide rates in the military were highest among people divorced or separated \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with a rate of 19 per 100,000 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 24% higher than troops who are single.\n[14] We suggest that moral injury is likely one of the most important factors in military suicide rates. Moral injury is not PTSD. The latter is a dysfunction of brain areas that suppress fear and integrate feeling with coherent memory; symptoms include flashbacks, nightmares, dissociative episodes and hyper-vigilance. PTSD is an immediate injury of trauma.\n[15] Most suicides happen among troops who have not seen combat.. But what about post-traumatic stress disorder? The study authors looked at PTSD as a factor but found that only nine of the 83 people who committed suicide -- about 10% -- had been diagnosed with PTSD or reported experiencing symptoms of PTSD.\n[16] Among deployed and non-deployed active duty Veterans who served during the Iraq or Afghanistan wars between 2001 and 2007, the rate of suicide was greatest the first three years after leaving service, according to a recent study.\n[17] The number of suicide deaths in the U.S. military surged to a record 349 last year \u00e2\u0080\u0094 more than the 295 Americans who died fighting in Afghanistan in 2012. The numbers were first reported by the AP; NPR has confirmed them. The new figures show that the number of military suicides rose from 2011, when 301 such deaths were reported.\n[18] U.S. Military's Suicide Rate Surpassed Combat Deaths In 2012 : The Two-Way The number of deaths by suicide in the U.S. military surged to a record 349 last year \u00e2\u0080\u0094 more than the 295 Americans who died fighting in Afghanistan in 2012. The numbers were first reported by the AP; NPR has confirmed them.\n[19] 6,500 former military personnel killed themselves in 2012. More veterans succumbed to suicide than were killed in Iraq. In 2012, 177 active-duty soldiers committed suicide, conversely 176 soldiers were killed in combat. In other words, more soldiers committed suicide compared to being killed in action. In 2012, the study concluded that Army had the highest number of suicides compared to any other service branch.\n[20] At least 22 veterans commit suicide every day and young male veterans under the age of 30 are three times more likely to commit suicide when compared to civilian males in the same age bracket, according to a new briefing released Thursday by the Department of Veteran Affairs.\nSearch Query: causes of military suicide.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

The lifespan of a properly taken care of goldfish is 20+ years. In this kind of setup, it's impressive if they live even one.\n[4] Only about 80 percent of goldfish eggs develop. Remove any that remain cloudy since these eggs are unfertilized and will grow fungi that can spread to developing eggs. Goldfish fry typically take several days before they become free-swimming. During this time, the baby fish live off their yolk sacs.\n[5] It may come as a shock to you but, wild goldfish do not eat flakes or pellets.

Answering Girl \u00c2\u00b7 8 years ago.\n[9] Common goldfish, comet goldfish, and other single tail goldfish need ponds or huge tanks as they can grow up to a foot or more in length. Do not get single tails unless you have a 180 US gallon (681.4 liter) tank laying around or a pond into which you can transition them when they get too large. For decades goldfish were touted as being able to live in small bowls, and thus why they have a reputation of having short life spans.\n[10] Keep your common goldfish in a pond, as they are supposed to grow to a size of almost 12 inch (30 cm). Commons come in many different color varieties, including orange, yellow, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwild\u00e2\u0080\u009d color (brownish) and white. Their patterns can range from an even color to all kinds of color combinations and spots.

The female releases her eggs into the water, and the male releases his sperm to fertilize the eggs. Goldfish reach sexual maturity at approximately 1 year of age. The mating ritual of goldfish involves the male chasing the female and nudging against her to prompt her to release her eggs.\n[12] The Bubble Eye is an omnivourus goldfish species.It is very docile and is often fed vegetable/growth/protein mixtures.Bubble Eyes can grow to be up to 6 inches long, and 1 inch deep!Bubble Eyes have a fluid filled sac under each eye, which can be ruptured easily.\n[13] In the wild, goldfish can be found in slow-moving, freshwater bodies of water. As with their close relative the carp, they thrive in slightly murky water. In captivity, an aquarium with live plants and a dirt bottom is ideal. Bi-weekly water changes are a good idea as a goldfish tank is hard to keep clean.\n[14] Full Color. While goldfish are sexually mature at one year old, they may take up to two years to develop their adult coloration. Often, goldfish fry start out a brownish silver color and only later develop into their trademark gold color. Some drabber goldfish retain this darker silver coloration.\n[15] Goldfish are not toxic in any way. This myth likely stems from the large amounts of ammonia these fish excrete, but all fish excrete ammonia, not only goldfish. Goldfish do tend to be messy and eat a lot. They are also a heavy-bodied species, so they excrete more waste than other species of smaller sizes. But they can still be kept with other fish.\n[16] Koi and other goldfish can grow very large, sometimes reaching lengths of over 3 feet (0.9 m)! They're best housed in large ponds with a TON of filtration and weekly water changes.

People who say they get to be three feet long probably have goldfish confused with koi or other carp.\n[19] Common goldfish normally live for between five and 15 years. Those kept in small tanks, like Splish and Splash, are not generally expected to live for more than ten. But Splash still has a long way to go to beat the world record holder \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Tish, a goldfish which died at the grand old age of 43 in 2005.\n[20] In the wild, goldfish can be found in slow-moving, freshwater bodies of water. As with their close relative the carp, they thrive in slightly murky water. In captivity, an aquarium with live plants and a dirt bottom is ideal. Bi-weekly water changes are a good idea as a goldfish tank is hard to keep clean. Live plants must be replaced fairly regularly; goldfish enjoy eating them.

The longest lived goldfish on record lived to age 43. Improper care or life in a bowl greatly reduces the typical lifespan of a goldfish.\n[9] A goldfish can survive for a short time in an unfiltered small bowl or in a tank with poor water quality, but if he lives in unfit water for very long, his life will be shortened considerably.\n[10] Goldfish Development. Baby goldfish are born much darker than they will be as adults. This may be because dark colors helps these small, vulnerable fish escape the attention of predators. With proper husbandry, the fish gradually change color and develop orange or gold scales.

Almost all of the goldfish you see in the big box pet stores are well under a year in age.\n[5] The bigger the fishtank, the bigger the fish will grow.Not only does it matter how big your tank/pond is but it also depends greatly on what the fish is fed, the variety of the fish, and the fishes genetics. Many goldfish can grow over a foot long-here is a list of standard sizes to expect a goldfish to grow:\n[6] Goldfish are a bit meh, aren't they? They're not as popular a pet as cats or dogs, presumably due to the deplorable lack of cuddles. Really they just swim around, opening and closing their mouths, endlessly tormenting your cat with the promise of a tasty snack. That's about it. But there is more to your fishy pet than meets the eye. Here are four things you probably didn't know about goldfish.\n[7] If kept in a suitable environment, single tail goldfish normally grow to 10 inches (25cm) and can sometimes reach 12 inches (30cm). Fancy goldfish normally grow to 8 inches (20cm). The normal life expectancy of a single tail goldfish is about 20 years.\n[8] The Common Goldfish is an omnivourus goldfish species.It is very docile and is often fed vegetable food.The Common Goldfish can grow up to be 40 inches long!The Common Goldfish is the longest living goldfish, and the hardiest also!The Common Goldfish can live up to be 45 years old!It's color is orange.The Common Goldfish has a slim, long body and a ...\n[9] The goldfish food that you feed them plays a part in their growth as well. If you want your goldfish to grow fast consider feeding them a wide variety of food. Also high growth food will help as well maximizing the growth of your goldfish.\n[10] Their size is limited in the tank, but when you release it into the wild, that doesn't exist anymore, Wilson told The Post. Like other species of carp, the domestic goldfish Carassius auratus will basically keep growing as long as water temperatures and food resources support it.\n[11] Goldfish commonly grow to over 12 inches. The size of your tank would indicate that it is not really large enough for keeping goldfish in. The basic rule of fishkeeping \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 is 1 Inch of fish needs a minimum of 1 gallon of water. Goldfish should really be kept in a pond.\n[12] In actual fact, healthy goldfish should live for 10 years or over. goldfish should NOT under any circumstance be kept in a bowl. They need to be kept in a large tank (10 gallons for each fish) with a working filter, alive plants, hiding places (pots) and PH tested water.\n[13] They will relish some blanched leafy greens and frozen or live meaty foods as well as nibble at pond plants and snack on aquatic insects for additional nutrition. Kept well, goldfish can live in your pond for well over 15 to 20 years. If you have a very large pond, you can also keep goldfish and koi together.\n[14] Goldfish bowls really shouldn't exist, to be honest. Goldfish can grow very large and some have lived up to 30 years! The recommendation is that you give a goldfish 10 gallons for every inch it is. So if your goldfish is 2 inches long, ideally it would have 20 gallons. While that seems a little excessive for most people, a ten gallon tank with a filter would be a great place to start. As other people have mentioned, goldfish are considered dirty fish.\n[15] Goldfish ponds need to provide clean, well oxygenated water for its inhabitants to grow up happy and healthy. A goldfish can grow up to 12 inches(30cm) plus. The minimum size pond is 8 feet X 6 feet and 3 feet deep(2.5m X 2m X 1m).\n[16] Common goldfish, comet goldfish, and other single tail goldfish need ponds or huge tanks as they can grow up to a foot or more in length. Do not get single tails unless you have a 180 US gallon (681.4 liter) tank laying around or a pond into which you can transition them when they get too large. For decades goldfish were touted as being able to live in small bowls, and thus why they have a reputation of having short life spans.\n[17] Keep your common goldfish in a pond, as they are supposed to grow to a size of almost 12 inch (30 cm). Commons come in many different color varieties, including orange, yellow, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwild\u00e2\u0080\u009d color (brownish) and white. Their patterns can range from an even color to all kinds of color combinations and spots. Comets are quite similar to commons, the only difference being their tail \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Comets have much longer, flowier tails.\n[18] Koi and other goldfish can grow very large, sometimes reaching lengths of over 3 feet (0.9 m)! They're best housed in large ponds with a TON of filtration and weekly water changes. With the right size pond, filter and other equipment, caring for koi and goldfish can be lots of fun.\n[19] The bigger the fishtank, the bigger the fish will grow.Not only does it matter how big your tank/pond is but it also depends greatly on what the fish is fed, the variety of the fish, and the fishes genetics. Many goldfish can grow over a foot long- here is a list of standard sizes to expect a goldfish to grow:\n[20] All goldfish fry have the same physical characteristics for the first 5 weeks, so the growth rate is similar for all varieties up to that age. After 5 weeks the deep bodied varieties start to take their adult shape, so growth rates slow when compared to the slim bodied varieties such as Comets.\nSearch Query: do goldfish grow.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

As mentioned above these factors will influence the growth potential of your goldfish. For example the how clean your water is impacts how fast they will grow. If the water is too clear then lacks algae and food to feed on.\n[2] Goldfish are very large compared to many tropical fish species. Most fancy goldfish varieties grow up to 6 or 7 inches long (15 or 18 centimeters), while common and comet goldfish can grow to a foot long (30 centimeters) and even more. Though there are exceptions, tropical fish tend to stay small.\n[3] Goldfish can live for many years if properly cared for, a bowl is not large enough. My goldfish lived 10 years in a 27 gallon tank but may have lived longer in a pond. 1 liter won't be enough - goldfish can grow to 10 inches long or even larger than that. Thanks guys I was so worried but not anymore.\n[4] Baby goldfish, called fry, go through several phases of development before they look like adult fish. Each phase requires different foods and different types of care. Goldfish take about a year to reach maturity, though they may change somewhat after that.\n[5] They vary in their fin configuration, coloration and in their body size, which is directly influenced by their environment. When they are kept as pets in small fish tanks and aquariums, goldfish tend to stay about 1-2 inches long and never grow larger than 6 inches (15 centimeters), according to the DEC. However, in the wild, goldfish often reach 12 to 14 inches (30 to 35 cm) in length.\n[6] Fancy goldfish don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t grow as large as Common goldfish. A good size would be around 5 inches body length for most fancy varieties, 8 inches for Comets and 12 inches for Common Goldfish. These sizes are usually only attained by pond grown fish.\n[7] Goldfish Hanging Plant \u00e2\u0080\u0093 How To Grow Goldfish Houseplant. Goldfish plants (Columnea gloriosa) come to us from the Central and South American tropics and derive their common name from the unusual shape of their flowers, which with some imagination, resemble fish. Under ideal conditions, the goldfish hanging plant blooms prolifically in a variety of reds, oranges and yellows.\n[8] Goldfish commonly grow to over 12 inches.

Goldfish sold as tank suitable will grow to about 10 inches while those sold as pond suitable will reach a maximum of about 18 inches.\n[11] A mother claims she has to keep buying new tanks for her foot-long goldfish who is still growing - and gets 'angry and violent' if he is not fed on time. When Anne Cooper, 56, bought two goldfish from a Scarborough pet store three years ago, they were both only an inch long.\n[12] No, a fish bowl is just too small for a fish that has the potential to grow over 12 inches in length. A goldfish needs an aquarium of at least 30 gallons (with proper filtrati \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 on and aeration) to thrive. Only a betta can live in a fish bowl. Goldfish generally don't get as big as they say but they do get large.\n[13] Ensuring that Your Fish Reaches Maturity. 1 1. Consider where you purchased your fish.

But give a goldfish good quality water and lots of space and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give him every chance of growing to a good size.\n[2] Large aquariums are a definite requirement for their long-term care and survival, as goldfish can grow quite large, depending on the breed. The common goldfish, so popular on fairgrounds, are among the largest, and they are capable of reaching over 18 inches and 10 pounds.\n[3] A large tank gives your goldfish plenty of room to grow to their full potential. In a small 5-gallon aquarium, your goldfish will still grow. But growth will become stunted, and your goldfish won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to develop properly. In such an environment, goldfish usually don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t last any more than a couple of years.\n[4] So to really answer the question, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow Fast Do Goldfish Grow\u00e2\u0080\u009d really has too many factors to really answer. Also genetics plays a part in this as well. If you look at some people today some are skinny, some are large, medium, petite, tall and short. Everyone grows differently and the same goes for goldfish.\n[5] Hardly anything breeds true.. People who groom goldfish for shows take such extreme measures as daily 100% water changes and feeding every hour during daylight hours to produce big fish fast. Some of them also say that show fish aren't good breeders and don't live as long as fish that grow at a normal rate.\n[6] Goldfish are actually very complex creatures. Amazingly, they can reach lengths of 12 or more inches and live 10 to 20 years. The oldest goldfish on record was over 40 years! Goldfish are among the hardiest of fish, and can survive through the worst of conditions. They are perfectly adapted to life in a pond, just like their wild carp ancestors.\n[7] 1 Sadly, many goldfish never live long enough to even grow the 8 inches, 10 inches, or even 20 inches long their body was destined to be. Water changes can be very stressful in a small goldfish tank. Goldfish prefer water that maintains a constant temperature. A small aquarium just can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hold enough water mass.\n[8] Large aquariums are a definite requirement for their long-term care and survival, as goldfish can grow quite large, depending on the breed.

Fairground goldfish can live for years and grow to astounding proportions, and like all carp can learn to feed from a human hand. (Watch out for the teeth.) They can also be released into the wild and will happily interbreed with local carp, losing their conspicuous colouring after a few generations.\n[11] The Common Goldfish is an omnivourus goldfish species.It is very docile and is often fed vegetable food.The Common Goldfish can grow up to be 40 inches long!The Common Goldfish is the longest living goldfish, and the hardiest also!The Common Goldfish can live up to be 45 years old!It's color is orange.The Common Goldfish has a slim, long body and a ...\n[12] Their size is limited in the tank, but when you release it into the wild, that doesn't exist anymore, Wilson told The Post.

The most common goldfish in state fairs and pet shops is the \u00e2\u0080\u009ccommon goldfish.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n[3] Goldfish growth rates can be massive for their first few weeks after hatching in a perfect growing environment, as much as a 50% or more increase in body length in a week. Goldfish growth rates are totally dependent on the conditions they are kept in, and the amount of high quality food they receive.\n[4] You will see your goldfish grow fast. The goldfish food that you feed them plays a part in their growth as well. If you want your goldfish to grow fast consider feeding them a wide variety of food. Also high growth food will help as well maximizing the growth of your goldfish.\n[5] Goldfish may grow to a maximum length of 23 inches (59 cm) and a maximum weight of 9.9 pounds (4.5 kg), although this is rare; most individual goldfish grow to under half this size. In optimal conditions, goldfish may live more than 20 years (the world record is 49 years); however, most household goldfish generally only live six to eight years.\n[6] This completely depends on the species of fish. Goldfish will live 20-30 years and grow to be a foot long, if you let them. Most die within a few years because people don't look after them well. Fish need bigger tanks as they grow; it is a common misconception that fish only grow to the size of their container.\n[7] Fancy Goldfish (Ryukins, orandas, fan tail, bubble eyes) - Grow about 6 inches. Ranchus, Lion heads, Pearl Scales-grow about 3 - 4 inches. Common Goldfish (comets) - They can reach lengths of 2 feet or more. Koi-grow about 12 - 24 inches, sometimes more.\n[8] Fancy goldfish typically grow to 8 inches, while single tail goldfish grow to 10 and sometimes up to 12 inches in length.

The largest goldfish recorded is over 16 inches.\n[3] Myth. How big your goldfish will grow is determined by the animal's genetics, not by the size of his environment. If your goldfish doesn't have enough space to grow to his full size, he will likely die before you notice that the environment is not large enough.\n[4] A: The conditions goldfish are kept in plus their diet determine how large they will grow. I have seen goldfish grow ridiculously large in very small containers when their water was changed frequently. Goldfish will not grow if water conditions are poor. Fancy goldfish don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t grow as large as Common goldfish. A good size would be around 5 inches body length for most fancy varieties, 8 inches for Comets and 12 inches for Common Goldfish. These sizes are usually only attained by pond grown fish.\n[5] A Goldfish will grow quicker if you increase its metabolism slightly. This can be done by keeping the water at summer temperatures of around 65F to 70F. Goldfish kept at this higher temp will also need added space (2 gals per inch of fish), air bubbles and a really good filtration system.\n[6] If the tank is not large enough to allow the goldfish to grow, it's growth will be stunted and this can cause the fish to become unhealthy and die.

Ecological anthropology is a sub-field of anthropology and is defined as the \u00e2\u0080\u009cstudy of cultural adaptations to environments\u00e2\u0080\u009d. The sub-field is also defined as, the study of relationships between a population of humans and their biophysical environment .he first ecological anthropologists explored the idea that humans as ecological populations should be the unit of analysis, and culture became the means by which that population alters and adapts to the environment.\n[3] 1 Meaning of environment. Environment means everything around to a living being. Especially the circumstances of life of people or society in their life conditions. It comprises the set of natural, social and cultural values existing in a place and at a particular time, that influence in the life of the human being and in the generations to come.\n[4] Environmental anthropology is a sub-specialty within the field of anthropology that takes an active role in examining the relationships between humans and their environment across space and time.pplied anthropology utilizes these understandings to work with people on a local basis as well as trying to satisfy share holders working to gain a resolution for problems related to health, education, social welfare, development and environmental protection.\n[5] Definition of environment - the surroundings or conditions in which a person, animal, or plant lives or operates, the natural world, as a whole or in a partic Definition of environment - the surroundings or conditions in which a person, animal, or plant lives or operates, the natural world, as a whole or in a partic dictionary thesaurus\n[6] Definition of environment: The sum total of all surroundings of a living organism, including natural forces and other living things, which provide conditions for development and growth as well as of danger and damage.

Up to 130 vesicles can be released per bouton over a ten-minute period of stimulation at 0.2 Hz. In the human brain region V1 synaptic vesicles have an average diameter of 39.5 nanometers with a standard deviation of 5.1 nanometers.ith the advent of modern electron microscopic techniques in the early 1950s, nerve endings were found to contain a large number of electron-lucent vesicles. The term synaptic vesicle was first introduced by De Robertis and Bennett in 1954.\n[10] a slender branching process that extends from the cell body of a neuron and that is capable of being stimulated by a neurotransmitter. Each neuron usually possesses several dendrites, which receive synapses where chemical transmission occurs from axons to dendrites (or an axon, in the case of unipolar neurons).\n[11] The dendrite receives the chemical signal or neurotransmitter sodium ions axon terminal branches fire off the signal over the synaptic gap to the next neuron. The synaptic gap is less than 1 millionth of an inch! In the brain, your neurons are packed together pretty tightly.\n[12] The synapse subserves the transmission of nerve impulses, commonly from a club-shaped axon terminal (the presynaptic element) to the circumscript patch of the plasma membrane of the receiving cell (the postsynaptic element) on which the synapse occurs.\n[13] Voltage-gated sodium channels in the membrane of the soma, axon, and axon terminal allow positively charged sodium ions to enter the neuron and produce rapid (in milliseconds) conduction of the excitatory action potential to the terminal. This signal stimulates neurotransmitter release at the axon terminal.ABA B receptors also are found on presynaptic terminals of neurons in many brain regions (Bowery et al. 1990). When activated, these receptors inhibit neurotransmitter release via mechanisms that involve inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels whose function is necessary for proper release.\n[14] A neuromuscular junction is a synapse between a motoneuron and a muscle cell it innvervates. The. prejunctional nerve terminal is a transducer that converts an electrical signal (an action potential in. the prejunctional motoneuron) into a chemical signal (transmitter release).\n[15] axon. 1. that process of a neuron by which impulses travel away from the cell body; at the terminal arborization of the axon, the impulses are transmitted to other nerve cells or to effector organs.

The term dendrite is derived from the Greek dendron, which means tree. Microscopically, dendrites have a treelike appearance, are heavily branched, and have multiple boutons, terminal knobs, or synaptic knobs. These knobs give dendrites a rough appearance.\n[17] A presynaptic neuron has several specialized structures that distinguish it from a postsynaptic neuron. The terminal button of the presynaptic neuron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s axon contains mitochondria as well as microtubules that transport the neurotransmitters from the cell body (where they are produced) to the tip of the axon.\n[18] In the synaptic region, the plasma membrane of the presynaptic cell is specialized for vesicle exocytosis; synaptic vesicles, which contain a neurotransmitter, are clustered in these regions. The opposing membrane of the postsynaptic cell (in this case, a neuron) contains receptors for the neurotransmitter. Figure 21-30, Lodish 4th edition.

When an action potential is generated, it travels (propagates) the length an axon to the synapatic knobs, where it signals the synaptic vesicles to release some of the stored neurotransmitters.\n[7] The synapse consists of the synaptic terminal, or presynaptic ending, of a sending neuron, a postsynaptic ending of the receiving cell that contains receptor sites, and the space between them (the synaptic cleft). The synaptic terminal contains neurotransmitters and cell organelles including mitochondria.\n[8] The junction between the axon terminals of a neuron and the receiving cell is called a synapse. (Synapses at muscle fibers are also called neuromuscular junctions or myoneural junctions 1 .). Action potentials travel down the axon of the neuron to its end(s), the axon terminal(s). Transmission between neurons is as much as ten times faster than in chemical synapses. 2 Thus electrical synapses can mediate, for example, the very rapid escape response of crayfish that encounter a threat. 3 Electrical synapses in the CNS permit groups of interneurons to fire together.\n[9] The sequence of events at a synapse is as follows : 1) A nerve impulse reaches the axon terminal of a presynaptic neuron; the membrane is depolarised by an action potential. 2) Depolarisation of the axon terminal during the action potential causes voltage sensitive calcium ion channels to open in the terminal knob.)

Synapses are essential for homeostasis as they can either transmit or inhibit impulses.) A nerve impulse reaches the axon terminal of a presynaptic neuron; the membrane is depolarised by an action potential. 2) Depolarisation of the axon terminal during the action potential causes voltage sensitive calcium ion channels to open in the terminal knob.\n[11] An axon terminal is the structure of a neuron (a single cell of the central or peripheral nervous system) at the end of it's axon that forms a synapse with another neuron. Generally, the axon terminal is the point at which a neuron passes information to the neurons with which it is connected.\n[12] Neurotransmitters are packaged into synaptic vesicles that cluster beneath the axon terminal membrane on the presynaptic side of a synapse. The axonal terminals are specialized to release the electrical impulse of the presynaptic cell.ctivity at an axon terminal: Neuron A is transmitting a signal at the axon terminal to neuron B (receiving).

Action potentials travel down the axon of the neuron to its end(s), the axon terminal(s).xcitatory synapses. The neurotransmitter at excitatory synapses depolarizes the postsynaptic membrane (of a neuron in this diagram). 1 Binding of acetylcholine to its receptors on the postsynaptic cell opens up ligand-gated sodium channels. 2 These allow an influx of Na + ions, reducing the membrane potential.\n[15] The junction between the axon terminals of a neuron and the receiving cell is called a synapse.

When a gene is transcribed, the intervening introns are cut or \u00e2\u0080\u009cspliced\u00e2\u0080\u009d out, and the exons are strung back together to form the sequence that is then translated into protein.\n[3] Transcrition/translation - Exons and introns. In most eukaryotic genes, coding regions (exons) are interrupted by noncoding regions (introns). During transcription, the entire gene is copied into a pre-mRNA, which includes exons and introns. During the process of RNA splicing, introns are removed and exons joined to form a contiguous coding sequence. This mature mRNA is ready for translation.\n[4] Eukaryotic genes are split up into parts that are expressed as RNA products and parts that are not. The parts that are expressed are called exons. They appear in short sequences scattered throughout the gene. Exons are the parts of a eukaryotic gene that are expressed through transcription and translation.\n[5] Always happy to ask and answer questions. Exons are the coding regions which bear codons, each codon representing one amino acid. Thus exons are directly responsible for the amino acid sequence of the proteins. Introns are intervening sequences and bear no coding regions and cannot influence the protein sequence.efore the RNA leaves the nucleus, the introns are removed and the exons are joined together, producing an mRNA molecule with a continuous coding sequence. This process is cal \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 led RNA splicing.\n[6] Exons and introns are part of the mRNA. During transcription inside the nucleus, introns are removed from the mRNA because they are not coded to make a protein. Exons are then \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 joined together because that is the part required for translation.\n[7] The coding sections are called exons, and a collection of exons make up a gene. Genes can then be read by the cell's machinery in a process called transcription. A process called translation then occurs, which as the name suggests 'translates' the sequence of DNA bases into a polypeptide chain, hence making a protein.he nucleus contains chromosomes (23 pairs in human cell) the chromosomes consists of DNA molecules and proteins(histone and nonhistone proteins) the genes are specific sequence of nucleotides (the building unite of DNA) on the DNA. Little princess \u00c2\u00b7 8 years ago.\n[8] Together, all the exons in a genome are known as the exome, and the method of sequencing them is known as whole exome sequencing. This method allows variations in the protein-coding region of any gene to be identified, rather than a select few genes.\n[9] Alternative splicing (AS) therefore is a process by which exons or portions of exons or noncoding regions within a pre-mRNA transcript are differentially joined or skipped, resulting in multiple protein isoforms being encoded by a single gene.\n[10] Description: In most eukaryotic genes, coding regions (exons) are interrupted by noncoding regions (introns).

The term intron refers to both the DNA sequence within a gene and the corresponding sequence in RNA transcripts.\n[15] Introns. Introns are sequences of nucleotides present in the genes between exons. These nucleotide sequences do not code for proteins, and that means introns are not immediately important for the process of protein synthesis. Exons are found at the two ends of a gene while introns are always found inside the gene. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 When mutations take place, introns sometimes contribute nucleotides but usually not the other way around. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Both DNA and RNA contain introns and exons, but mature RNA only contain exons and not the introns.\n[16] \u00c2\u00a5Introns are intervening sequences-not expressed in proteins\u00c2\u00a5Exons are retained in the mature mRNA molecules. \u00c3\u0090expressing sequences \u00c2\u00a5Exon and intron lengths and numbers vary in various genes: \u00c3\u0090extreme example is dystrophin gene: \u00c2\u00a5Gene size: 2500 Kb\u00c2\u00a5mRNA size: 14kb\u00c2\u00a5Exons: 79/18.\n[17] An intron is a nucleotide sequence within a gene. It is a noncoding sequence. During the final maturation of the RNA product, the RNA removes it by splicing. 1 The term intron pertains to the DNA sequence within a gene as well as the corresponding sequence in the RNA transcripts. 2 It is used in contrast to the nucleotide sequences joined together in a mature RNA after splicing called exons.\n[18] (molecular biology) A noncoding, intervening sequence of DNA within a gene that is transcribed into mRNA but is removed from the primary gene transcript and rapidly degraded during maturation of the RNA product. Supplement. An intron is a nucleotide sequence within a gene.

I forgot what rRNA does but it stands for ribosomal RNA and ribosomes are used in the production of proteins.Your Knight In Shining Armor \u00c2\u00b7 8 years ago. Thumbs up.est Answer: An exon exon is a nucleic acid sequence that is represented in the mature form of an RNA molecule, not transcribed from DNA.\n[2] Genes contain exons which are regions coding for proteins and which are interrupted by the unused sequences called introns. Exons have been found to include both sequences coding for amino acids and untranslated sequences. The introns are removed and the exons are joined together to form the final functional mRNA.\n[3] These arguments lead to the conclusion that the vast majority of cellular DNA isn't functional. Genes that are expressed usually have introns that interrupt the coding sequences. A typical eukaryotic gene, therefore, consists of a set of sequences that appear in mature mRNA (called exons) interrupted by introns. The regions between genes are likewise not expressed, but may help with chromatin assembly, contain promoters, and so forth.

The exons are the portions that eventually exit the nucleus in the form of mRNA and are used in translation. The introns are removed from the mRNA shortly after transcription.There are a number of hypotheses about the function of introns.One hypothesis is that alternative splicing may allow a single gene to code for more than one version of a protein. In other words a piece of the gene may be an intron in one case and an exon in another case.Another possible explanation is that each exon codes for a module of a protein.ne hypothesis is that alternative splicing may allow a single gene to code for more than one version of a protein. In other words a piece of the gene may be an intron in one case and an exon in another case. Another possible explanation is that each exon codes for a module of a protein.\n[15] The nucleic acid sequence in the DNA, or RNA transcript following genetic splicing. Supplement. Genes contain exons which are regions coding for proteins and which are interrupted by the unused sequences called introns. Exons have been found to include both sequences coding for amino acids and untranslated sequences. The introns are removed and the exons are joined together to form the final functional mRNA. Related forms: exonic (adjective). Compare: intron. See also: DNA, RNA, translation, mRNA, protein synthesis.\n[16] The sum total of the exons in a genome, which comprise about 1% of human DNA. The exome is regarded as the most functionally relevant DNA, as it encodes proteins and gene products.\n[17] 5. Exons can be termed as DNA bases which are translated into mRNA. Introns are also DNA bases that are found in between exons. 6. Introns are very much common in the genome of higher vertebrates such as human beings and mice but unlikely to be seen in the genome of certain varieties of eukaryotic micro-organisms..

Introns are very much common in the genome of higher vertebrates such as human beings and mice but unlikely to be seen in the genome of certain varieties of eukaryotic micro-organisms.\n[18] In some genes, not all of the DNA sequence is used to make protein. Introns are noncoding sections of an RNA transcript, or the DNA encoding it, that are spliced out before the RNA molecule is translated into a protein. The sections of DNA (or RNA) that code for proteins are called exons.\n[19] Exons (expressed sequences) contain the coding regions of the protein. Introns (interspersed sequences) are removed after transcription. In vertebrates usually only 5% of the gene is made up of exons. Below is pictured what the gene structure of a gene looks like on the NCBI website.\n[20] Exons vs Introns. Exons and introns are related to genes. An exon is termed as a nucleic acid sequence which is represented in the RNA molecule. Introns, on the other hand, are termed as nucleotide sequences seen within the genes which are removed through RNA splicing for generating a mature RNA molecule.. Exons are coding areas whereas introns are non-coding areas. 2. An exon is termed as a nucleic acid sequence which is represented in the RNA molecule.

Left ventricular noncompaction can also be part of syndromes that affect multiple parts of the body. When left ventricular noncompaction is part of a syndrome, it is caused by mutations in the gene that cause that syndrome. Additionally, left ventricular noncompaction has been found to develop in a small percentage of women during their first pregnancy.\n[3] The cause of dilated cardiomyopathy often can't be determined (idiopathic).

Higher pressures within blood vessels put a strain on the ventricle, making it difficult to satisfy the body's needs. Also, narrowing of the aortic valve, or stenosis, obstructs blood flow from the left ventricle. In patients with HCM, the ventricle can become thick and stiff, which adds extra strain on the heart.\n[7] Left ventricular hypertrophy that is caused by aortic valve stenosis might require surgery to repair the narrow valve or to replace it with an artificial or tissue valve.

It causes thickening of the heart muscle (especially the ventricles, or lower heart chambers), left ventricular stiffness, mitral valve changes and cellular changes.tiffness in the left ventricle occurs as a result of cellular changes that occur in the heart muscle when it thickens. The left ventricle is unable to relax normally and fill with blood. Since there is less blood at the end of filling, there is less oxygen-rich blood pumped to the organs and muscles.\n[15] asymmetrical septal hypertrophy (ASH) hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, sometimes specifically that in which the hypertrophy is localized to the interventricular septum. benign prostatic hypertrophy see under hyperplasia. ventricular hypertrophy hypertrophy of the myocardium of a ventricle, due to chronic pressure overload. a hypertrophy denotes an increase in the size or number of constituent fibers of a muscle.

True or physiologic hypertrophy results from excessive activity of muscle.\n[16] What is Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)? Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a thickening (hypertrophy) of the muscles of the wall of the left ventricle of the heart causing the heart to be less able to relax between contractions. In some cases, this can lead to an increase in pressure in the left atrium which then enlarges.\n[17] An enlarged left ventricle is usually due to either cardiomyopathy (a weakening of the heart muscle) or valvular heart disease. Valve disease is usually treated by correcting the underlying valve problem (initially with medicines, often later with surgery). The most common cause of an enlarged left ventricle is cardiomyopathy. Initial treatment is with medications, such as diuretics, digitalis, vasodilators (ACE inhibitors and/or ARB inhibitors), and beta blockers, such as carvedilol (Coreg) or metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol XL).\n[18] In this condition, the walls of the left and/or right ventricles of the heart become thin and stretched.

Hypertrophy is usually what causes left ventricular enlargement.\n[19] What you are already having i.e. aortic stenosis and cardiac stiffness ( most probably due to cardiac amyloidosis ) may cause the left ventricle to work harder to pump blood into the aorta and deposits of an abnormal protein (amyloid) in the heart tissue, which make it hard for the heart to work effectively.\n[20] If this happens, the condition is called obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Sometimes the septum, the wall that divides the left and right sides of the heart, thickens and bulges into the left ventricle. This can block blood flow out of the left ventricle. Then the ventricle must work hard to pump blood. Symptoms can include chest pain, dizziness, shortness of breath, or fainting.

The most common cause of an enlarged left ventricle is cardiomyopathy. Initial treatment is with medications, such as diuretics, digitalis, vasodilators (ACE inhibitors and/or ARB inhibitors), and beta blockers, such as carvedilol (Coreg) or metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol XL).\n[15] Right ventricular hypertrophy. Description, Causes and Risk Factors: Abbreviation: RVH. Right ventricular hypertrophy is the increase or the enlargement in the size of the right ventricle of the heart. The right ventricle is responsible for pumping blood towards the lungs. In the lungs, blood is mixed with oxygen and then pumped back to the left ventricle to be eventually distributed to the brain and to other parts of the body. There are several possible causes of right ventricular hypertrophy.\n[16] Right ventricular hypertrophy is a form of ventricular hypertrophy affecting the right ventricle. Blood travels through the right ventricle to the lungs via the pulmonary arteries. If conditions occur which decrease pulmonary circulation, meaning blood does not flow well from the heart to the lungs, extra stress can be placed on the right ventricle. This can lead to right ventricular hypertrophy. It can affect electrocardiography findings. An ECG with right ventricular hypertrophy may or may not\n[17] Right ventricular hypertrophy. Right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) is a form of ventricular hypertrophy affecting the right ventricle. Blood travels through the right ventricle to the lungs via the pulmonary arteries. If conditions occur which decrease pulmonary circulation, meaning blood does not flow well from the heart to the lungs, extra stress can be placed on the right ventricle. This can lead to right ventricular hypertrophy.\n[18] In this condition, the walls of the left and/or right ventricles of the heart become thin and stretched. The result is an enlarged heart. In the other types of cardiomegaly, the heart's large muscular left ventricle becomes abnormally thick. Hypertrophy is usually what causes left ventricular enlargement.\n[19] Glossary of Terms. Cardiac Hypertrophy. Cardiac hypertrophy is a thickening of the heart muscle (myocardium) which results in a decrease in size of the chamber of the heart, including the left and right ventricles. A common cause of cardiac hypertrophy is high blood pressure (hypertension) and heart valve stenosis.\n[20] As enlargement progresses, though, the heart's pumping ability declines. Dilated cardiomyopathy is the main type of cardiomegaly. In dilated cardiomyopathy, the walls of both the left and right side of the heart (ventricles) become thin and stretched. The result is an enlarged heart. In the other types of enlarged heart, the heart's muscular left ventricle becomes abnormally thick. High blood pressure usually causes left ventricular enlargement (hypertrophy), while hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is an inherited condition.\nSearch Query: causes of left ventricular hypertrophy.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Left ventricular hypertrophy as a predictor of cardiovascular risk.\n[7] What is left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)? The right and left sides of your heart do different jobs. The right side takes in blood that has travelled round the body and pumps it to the lungs. From here, the blood enters the left side of the heart from where it is pumped all round your body. Because the left side of the heart has to work harder to get blood round your body, it is usually this side that becomes enlarged when your blood pressure is too high. This is sometimes called left ventricular hypertrophy or LVH for short. In other words, it is another name for an enlarged heart. People with high blood pressure and an enlarged left side of the heart have four times the risk of a heart attack than someone with the same blood pressure but a normal-sized heart.\n[8] Hypertrophic heart disease is the abnormal thickening of the walls of the left ventricle. This can be congenital, related to valvular heart disease, autoimmune, or, most commonly, related to elevated blood pressure. The hypertrophy initially causes diastolic abnormalities. Because the thickened heart muscle is not as compliant as normal, the pressure inside the left ventricle may become elevated, and blood can back-up in the lungs.\n[9] Over time, this can cause the heart muscle to thicken. As the heart pumps against elevated pressure in the blood vessels, the left ventricle becomes enlarged and the amount of blood pumped by the heart each minute (cardiac output) goes down, a condition called left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).

These diseases destroy blood vessels in the lung, causing increased pressure in the remaining vessels.\n[2] As was described above, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is abnormal thickening of the heart muscle. However, it is important to put this in context of the rest of the history and examination, and why the ECG was obtained in the first place; the ECG result should not be taken by itself.\n[3] Patient Information. Left Ventricular Hypertrophy on ECG. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) means that the muscle of the left pumping chamber of the heart (left ventricle) is thickened. The left ventricle's job is to pump blood to the body, and conditions that increase the work the left ventricle has to do can lead to thickening of the muscle.\n[4] Definition and Etiology. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is defined as hypertrophy of the myocardium more than 1.5 cm, without an identifiable cause (Figure 1). Other causes of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, such as long-standing hypertension, amyloidosis, and aortic stenosis must first be excluded before HCM can be diagnosed.\n[5] The treatment for left ventricular hypertrophy depends on the cause of the condition. Doctors will aim to eliminate the cause of the heart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enlargement in order to normalize the heart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts and prevent incapacitation of the heart muscles.\n[6] Lifestyle changes can help lower your blood pressure and improve left ventricular hypertrophy signs. Consider: Weight loss. Left ventricular hypertrophy is often found in obese people regardless of blood pressure. Losing weight has been shown to reverse left ventricular hypertrophy. Limiting salt in your diet.\n[7] Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is serious when the muscle is very thick (max thickness >3 cm), or if the increased muscle mass is impeding blood flow through the heart (defined as increased outflow pressure gradient).\n[8] Ventricular hypertrophy. Ventricular hypertrophy (VH) is thickening of the walls of a ventricle (lower chamber) of the heart. Although left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is more common, right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) can also occur, as can hypertrophy of both ventricles, that is, biventricular hypertrophy (BVH). Ventricular hypertrophy can be part of various syndromes caused by any of various underlying diseases.\n[9] While ventricular hypertrophy occurs naturally as a reaction to aerobic exercise and strength training, it is most frequently referred to as a pathological reaction to cardiovascular disease, or high blood pressure. It is one aspect of ventricular remodeling.\n[10] Causes of Right Ventricular Hypertrophy. There are four usual causes of right ventricular hypertrophy. The first one is pulmonary hypertension. As stated earlier, pulmonary hypertension is a condition wherein the blood pressure increases in the pulmonary artery. And this can lead to shortness of breath, dizziness and fainting.\n[11] However, high blood pressure, or hypertension, is the most common cause by far. Higher pressures within blood vessels put a strain on the ventricle, making it difficult to satisfy the body's needs. Also, narrowing of the aortic valve, or stenosis, obstructs blood flow from the left ventricle. In patients with HCM, the ventricle can become thick and stiff, which adds extra strain on the heart.\n[12] High blood pressure forces your heart to work harder than necessary in order to pump blood to the rest of your body.

In hypertrophy the heart muscle becomes thicker. This can have different causes. Left ventricular hypertrophy results from an increase in left ventricular workload, e.g., during hypertension or aortic valve stenosis. Right ventricular hypertrophy results from an increase in right ventricular workload, e.g., emphysema or pulmonary embolization. These causes are fundamentally different from hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HCM), which is a congenital misalignment of cardiomyocytes, resulting in hypertrophy.\n[7] The most common ventricular hypertrophy occurs on the left side, but a recent study published in the journal Circulation found that right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) is associated with an increased risk of heart failure and cardiovascular death in patients without clinically diagnosed heart disease at the start of the study.\n[8] Left ventricular hypertrophy is more common in people who have uncontrolled high blood pressure. But no matter what your blood pressure is, developing left ventricular hypertrophy puts you at higher risk for a heart attack and stroke. Treating high blood pressure can help ease your symptoms and may reverse left ventricular hypertrophy.\n[9] Heart-Healthy Living.

Left ventricular hypertrophy is enlargement and thickening (hypertrophy) of the walls of your heart's main pumping chamber (left ventricle).\n[10] Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is thickening of the heart muscle of the left ventricle of the heart, that is, left-sided ventricular hypertrophy.\n[11] Over time, this can cause the heart muscle to thicken. As the heart pumps against elevated pressure in the blood vessels, the left ventricle becomes enlarged and the amount of blood pumped by the heart each minute (cardiac output) goes down, a condition called left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Without treatment, this can lead to heart failure.\n[12] As the heart pumps against elevated pressure in the blood vessels, the left ventricle becomes enlarged and the amount of blood pumped by the heart each minute (cardiac output) goes down, a condition called left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Without treatment, this can lead to heart failure.\n[13] What is left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)? The right and left sides of your heart do different jobs. The right side takes in blood that has travelled round the body and pumps it to the lungs. From here, the blood enters the left side of the heart from where it is pumped all round your body. Because the left side of the heart has to work harder to get blood round your body, it is usually this side that becomes enlarged when your blood pressure is too high. This is sometimes called left ventricular hypertrophy or LVH for short. In other words, it is another name for an enlarged heart. People with high blood pressure and an enlarged left side of the heart have four times the risk of a heart attack than someone with the same blood pressure but a normal-sized heart.\n[14] High blood pressure forces your heart to work harder than necessary in order to pump blood to the rest of your body. This causes the left ventricle to thicken or stiffen (left ventricular hypertrophy). These changes limit the ventricle's ability to pump blood to your body.\n[15] What is Left Ventricular Hypertrophy? Left ventricular hypertrophy is a disorder of the heart involving the enlargement or thickening of the wall of cardiac muscle situated in the chamber of the heart known as the left ventricle.\n[16] Patient Information. Left Ventricular Hypertrophy on ECG. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) means that the muscle of the left pumping chamber of the heart (left ventricle) is thickened. The left ventricle's job is to pump blood to the body, and conditions that increase the work the left ventricle has to do can lead to thickening of the muscle.\n[17] Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is serious when the muscle is very thick (max thickness >3 cm), or if the increased muscle mass is impeding blood flow through the heart (defined as increased outflow pressure gradient).\n[18] Hypertrophic heart disease is the abnormal thickening of the walls of the left ventricle. This can be congenital, related to valvular heart disease, autoimmune, or, most commonly, related to elevated blood pressure. The hypertrophy initially causes diastolic abnormalities. Because the thickened heart muscle is not as compliant as normal, the pressure inside the left ventricle may become elevated, and blood can back-up in the lungs.\n[19] However, high blood pressure, or hypertension, is the most common cause by far. Higher pressures within blood vessels put a strain on the ventricle, making it difficult to satisfy the body's needs. Also, narrowing of the aortic valve, or stenosis, obstructs blood flow from the left ventricle. In patients with HCM, the ventricle can become thick and stiff, which adds extra strain on the heart.\n[20] (Page 2) The most common causes of right ventricle hypertrophy (RVH) are diseases that damage the lung like emphysema and cystic fibrosis. These diseases destroy blood vessels in the lung, causing increased pressure in the remaining vessels.\nSearch Query: causes of left ventricular hypertrophy.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Factors that can cause your heart to work harder include: High blood pressure (hypertension). This is the most common cause of left ventricular hypertrophy. More than one-third of people show evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy at the time of their diagnosis with hypertension. Aortic valve stenosis.\n[2] By Mayo Clinic Staff. Left ventricular hypertrophy can occur when some factor makes your heart work harder than normal to pump blood to your body. Factors that can cause your heart to work harder include: High blood pressure (hypertension). This is the most common cause of left ventricular hypertrophy. More than one-third of people show evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy at the time of their diagnosis with hypertension.\n[3] Left ventricular hypertrophy can develop in response to some factor \u00e2\u0080\u0094 such as high blood pressure or a heart condition \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that causes the left ventricle to work harder. As the workload increases, the muscle tissue in the chamber wall thickens, and sometimes the size of the chamber itself also increases.\n[4] Factors that can cause your heart to work harder include: 1 High blood pressure (hypertension). This is the most common cause of left ventricular hypertrophy. More than one-third of people show evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy at the time of their diagnosis with hypertension. Aortic valve stenosis.\n[5] Left ventricular hypertrophy may cause or facilitate many cardiac complications of hypertension, including congestive heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and sudden death. Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, which may present with all of the symptoms and signs of congestive heart failure, is common in patients with long-standing hypertension.\n[6] Left ventricular hypertrophy can occur as an inborn disease in infants and children, due to an underlying condition known as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or HCM is a hereditary disease that involves an inborn abnormality of the cardiac muscles.\n[7] Left ventricular hypertrophy is enlargement and thickening (hypertrophy) of the walls of your heart's main pumping chamber (left ventricle).

LVH is often caused by high blood pressure or other heart problems and can lead to serious complications, such as heart disease, heart attack and heart failure.\n[9] Left ventricular hypertrophy is a thickening of the wall of the heart's main pumping chamber. This thickening may result in elevation of pressure within the heart and sometimes poor pumping action. The most common cause is high blood pressure.\n[10] Several underlying conditions can contribute to or influence the enlargement of the heart muscle in the left ventricle. Hypertension is the most common cause, setting the stage for left ventricular hypertrophy once a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blood pressure exceeds the normal level of 140/90 mm Hg. Aside from hypertension, the condition known as aortic valve stenosis is also a common cause of the hypertrophic changes in the heart.\n[11] See the Mayo Clinic webpage Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the thickening of the muscle of the left ventricle, usually because pumping against a higher resistance (hypertension, aortic valve defects) or as part of a hereditary heart muscle disease (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s correlated with more heart failure, more heart attacks, more deaths.\n[12] Left ventricular hypertrophy is thought to be the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in the adult population. This is most commonly the result of longstanding high blood pressure which has caused secondary damage to the wall of the main pumping chamber of the heart, the left ventricle.\n[13] Patients who present with a thickened left ventricle are likely suffering from left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). There are a few different causes of LVH. It is a strong indicator of potential coronary complications, and there is a strong correlation between certain types of LVH and morbidity and mortality.\n[14] Over time, this can cause the heart muscle to thicken.

However, even though this brand was created by a doctor, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean that the products are the right choice for everyone.\n[4] Theraderm Skin Renewal System. Theraderm Skin Renewal System is described as a total skincare system that may produce younger looking skin. This 5-product system is said to reduce fine lines, take care of rough skin and address sun damage. However, this system has received some low scores on consumer-driven websites that rate anti-aging products, which makes us wonder if this system does not live up to expectations.\n[5] The main ingredient in this Theraderm cream is lanolin, which is a chemical obtained from sheep\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wool. Lanolin is often used in skin care products because of its ability to boost the natural moisture barrier, as well as the ability to draw moisture to the application site.\n[6] Nowadays there are many skin care brands, like Theraderm, which are actively promoted by doctors and dermatologists. This is an interesting approach, because it boosts the image of the products through the associated skin care expertise of a doctor.\n[7] Thermi-Gen\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 is a non-surgical procedure that uses Radiofrequency (RF) energy to stimulate collagen for tightening and smoothing the skin of the face and neck. This procedure provides tighter, smoother, more youthful looking skin for all skin types (safe for light and dark complexions).hermi-Gen\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 technology is more effective because it has an internal probe that enables the doctor to apply the treating energy BELOW the skin surface \u00e2\u0080\u0093 directly to the targeted collagen layer. Another unique feature of Thermi-Gen\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 is its continuous temperature monitor located on the internal probe.\n[8] With ThermiTight, your physician applies a controlled amount of thermal energy to targeted tissue. The tip of the tiny probe provides constant feedback of the actual temperature during treatment. In addition, an infrared camera is used to monitor skin temperature to ensure that your treatment is both safe and effective.\n[9] Thermi-RF is a unique treatment that has the potential to lift and smooth sagging skin almost anywhere on your body. There are two modes: One on the skin surface, and one acting below your skin. Thermi-RF is thermistor controlled radio frequency.The simple description is that it offers very localized controlled heating of your skin and subcutaneous tissue. With continuous temperature monitoring, the risk of unplanned injury is minimized.hermi-RF is thermistor controlled radio frequency.

These cells assist in the transport of sugar and nutrients produced during photosynthesis from the leaves to other parts of the plant.\n[2] The vascular tissues and supporting tissues constitute the stele. Several kinds of vascular bundles are recognized. In the collateral pattern, the phloem lies only on one side of the xylem, usually toward the stem exterior. This arrangement is typical of the dicots, the majority of flowering plants, such as roses, apples, oaks, pines, etc.\n[3] The most distinctive cells found in xylem are the tracheary elements, that is tracheids and vessel elements.

The ferns, gymnosperms, and flowering plants are all vascular plants.\n[6] A tissue in vascular plants that conducts food from the leaves and other photosynthetic tissues to other plant parts. Phloem consists of several different kinds of cells: sieve elements, parenchyma cells, sclereids, and fibers. In mature woody plants it forms a sheathlike layer of tissue in the stem, just inside the bark.\n[7] It is in the diploid sporophyte that vascular tissue develops. Although some mosses have quite complex water-conducting vessels, bryophytes lack true vascular tissue. Like the vascular plants, bryophytes do have differentiated stems, and although these are most often no more than a few centimeters tall, they do provide mechanical support. Most bryophytes also have leaves, although these typically are one cell thick and lack veins. Unlike the vascular plants, bryophytes lack true roots or any deep anchoring structures. Some species do grow a filamentous network of horizontal stems, but these have a primary function of mechanical attachment rather than extraction of soil nutrients (Palaeos 2008).\n[8] Guard cells usually have chloroplasts. Cells in xylem and phloem tissue also usually lack chloroplasts. Xylem and phloem provide structural support and internal transport of water, minerals and organic compounds in plant organs.ieve tube elements are living cells without plastids or nuclei (they are run by their companion cells, which house the nuclei and necessary organelles).

The nonliving portion of a plant's vascular system that provides support and conveys water from the roots to the rest of the plant. It is made up of vessel elements and/or tracheids, water-conducting cells.\n[17] Xylem consists of three different types of cells: Xylem parenchyma cells and xylem fiber cells, which simply provide structural support for the most important xylem cells, the tracheary elements (TE). The TE are completely dead at maturity, and act like pipes to allow water and dissolved minterals to flow through them. There are two types of tracheary elements: vessel elements and tracheids.

You might think that large trees would have wide vessels and tracheids, so that water filters fast through the tree, but actually its the opposite. Trees have narrow vessels and tracheids so that water filters slowly up the tree. This indeed is less efficient at carrying water, but wider vessels are more likely to cavitate.

Water is constantly lost through transpiration from the leaf. When one water molecule is lost another is pulled along by the processes of cohesion and tension.\n[14] This is the only type of xylem found in the earliest vascular plants, and this type of cell continues to be found in the protoxylem (first-formed xylem) of all living groups of plants.

Tracheids are one of the two types of tracheary elements of vascular plants. (The other being the vessel elements). A tracheid cell loses its protoplast at maturity. Thus, at maturity, it becomes one of the non-living components of the xylem.\n[2] Tracheid. a dead lignified plant cell that functions in water conduction. Tracheids are found in the xylem of all higher plants except certain angiosperms, such as cereals and sedges, in which the water-conducting function is performed by vessels, or tracheae.Tracheids are usually polygonal in cross section; their walls have annular, spiral, or scalene thickenings or rimmed pores.racheids are found in the xylem of all higher plants except certain angiosperms, such as cereals and sedges, in which the water-conducting function is performed by vessels, or tracheae.

Tracheids are less specialized than the vessel members and are the only type of water-conducting cells in most gymnosperms and seedless vascular plants.\n[4] Woody angiosperms have also vessels. The mature tracheids form a column of superposed, cylindrical dead cells whose end walls have been perforated, resulting in a continuous tube called vessel (trachea) . Tracheids are found in all vascular plants and are the only conducting elements in gymnosperms and ferns.Tracheids have Pits on their end walls.

It is longer than a vessel element and has no perforation plates. Tracheids are elongated cells in the xylem of vascular plants that serve in the transport of water and mineral salts.Tracheids are one of two types of tracheary elements, vessel elements being the other. Tracheids, unlike vessel elements, do not have perforation plates.racheids provide most of the structural support in softwoods, where they are the major cell type. Because tracheids have a much higher surface to volume ratio compared to vessel elements, they serve to hold water against gravity (by adhesion) when transpiration is not occurring.\n[8] Tracheids and vessel elements form tube-shaped structures that provide pathways for water and minerals to travel from the roots to the leaves. While tracheids are found in all vascular plants, vessels are found only in angiosperms. Phloem is composed mostly of cells called sieve-tube cells and companion cells.

Picea glauca, the white spruce,[2] is a species of spruce native to the northern temperate and boreal forests in North America. Picea glauca was originally native from central Alaska all through the east, across southern/central Canada to the Avalon Peninsula in Newfoundland.\n[2] Sitka spruce, (Picea sitchensis,) known also as tideland spruce, coast spruce, and yellow spruce, is the largest of the world's spruces and is one of the most prominent forest trees in stands along the northwest coast of North America. Alaska didn't become a state, officially, until 1959. House Bill No. 325 proposed the Sitka spruce, the most valuable tree species in Alaska, as the official state tree of Alaska.\n[3] A taxonomic variety of white spruce, densata, can be found in the Black Hills of South Dakota and is often sold commercially as Black Hills spruce. The variety albertiana is sold as western white spruce or Alberta white spruce, although some experts believe it may be a form of densata.\n[4] Even the common dwarf forms such as `Dwarf Alberta, `Birds Nest and `Montgomery (at right) tend to grow much larger than many of us anticipate! As a reminder, spruce are easy to identify as theyre the only evergreen that has needles held individually on the stem that are square in cross section.\n[5] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping, however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe.runk of a black spruce. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (to 2.5 cm).\n[6] Picea sitchensis. Picea sitchensis, the Sitka spruce, is a large, coniferous, evergreen tree growing to almost 100 m (330 ft) tall,[1] and with a trunk diameter at breast height that can exceed 5 m (16 ft) (see List of superlative trees).\n[7] Product Description. Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On the average it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant , the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted on to.\n[8] Examine the cones. The cones of a spruce tree are also a good way to identify the tree. Cones grow from tree branches and contain the seeds of a tree. Spruces, pines and firs all contain cones, as do other conifers like cedars and hemlock trees. Spruce cones have smooth, thin scales, and are quite flexible and easy to bend.\n[9] Pinaceae -- Pine family. Gilbert H. Fechner. Blue spruce (Picea pungens) is also called Colorado blue spruce, Colorado spruce, silver spruce, and pino real. It is a slow-growing, long-lived tree of medium size that, because of its symmetry and color, is planted extensively as an ornamental.n its northern range (northern Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana), blue spruce is found only in scattered locations under established stands of narrowleaf cottonwood and among scattered ponderosa pine, with Engelmann spruce and white spruce (Picea glauca) associated with the species in the extreme north (64,84).\n[10] Fir needles, on the other hand, are softer, flat and cannot be rolled between your fingers. Spruce needles are attached to small, stalk-like woody projections. When needles are shed, these projections remain. As a result, the branches of spruce trees feel rough.\n[11] Members of the Picea Genus. Spruce trees and shrubs are classified in the genus Picea, which includes 35 species.

One of our most popular ornamental conifers, the Colorado blue spruce (or simply, blue spruce) is a truly magnificent sight. Perhaps Donald Culrose Peattie described it best in A Natural History of Western Trees. This insistently pretty tree displays its charms of tier on tier of branches graduated in perfect symmetry from the longest boughs that sweep the ground to the slender but strong top..\n[14] Spruce and fir trees have their needles attached individually to the branches. To tell spruce and fir trees apart, it helps to know that spruce needles are sharply pointed, square and easy to roll between your fingers. Fir needles, on the other hand, are softer, flat and cannot be rolled between your fingers. Spruce needles are attached to small, stalk-like woody projections. When needles are shed, these projections remain. As a result, the branches of spruce trees feel rough.\n[15] Uses: 1 The wood of white spruce is light, soft, and straight grained. Its primary uses have been for pulpwood, lumber, furniture, and boxes and crates. More elegant uses include sounding boards for pianos and violins. The tough, pliable roots were once used by Indians to lace birchbark canoes and to make woven baskets.\n[16] The Caucasian spruce can live in a wide variety of soil types. It will need to be sheltered from winds. This tree works well as a specimen conifer. If you want one with yellow needles, look for the 'Skylands', 'Aureospicata' and 'Aurea' cultivars. 'Barnes' and 'Nana' are dwarf cultivars, while 'Gowdy' is columnar.n fact, you should be able to identify a spruce tree just by looking at its needles. Anoher notable characteristic for identification is that unlike the fascicles of pine trees, each pulvinus only holds one spruce needle. The pulvini are arranged in a whorl around the branch.\n[17] White Spruce -----Picea Glauca. It will grow up to 60+ ft tall and 20+ ft wide it is very wind firm with the large spreading root system and flexible tough wood. It can live 80+ years in windbreaks and most do. Due to its shape, heavy snow and ice storms cause little damage. Deer will not normally eat this species unless there is nothing else.\n[18] The general white spruce growing to be 40\u00e2\u0080\u00b2-60\u00e2\u0080\u00b2 high and 10\u00e2\u0080\u00b2-20\u00e2\u0080\u00b2 wide, and the Black Hills spruce 20\u00e2\u0080\u00b2-40\u00e2\u0080\u00b2 high with a little narrower spread. Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 This spruce is native to the southwestern United States and is one of the most widely planted ornamental evergreens in South Dakota.\n[19] Common Name: Blue Spruce, Colorado Spruce. Picea abies Common Name: Norway Spruce . About the Spruce Tree . Spruce trees are coniferous (needle-leafed) evergreens. There are about 35 species in the genus Picea, native to the northern hemisphere. The name spruce is from the Latin pix, meaning pitch. These trees often live to a very old age. The oldest spruce on record is a Picea engelmannii that reached 852 years and is still thriving.\n[20] The leaves of conifers are of course their needles. On true pine trees, the needles are arranged and attached to the branches in clusters of two (red pine group), three (yellow pine group), or five (white pine group) needles per cluster. Spruce and fir trees have their needles attached individually to the branches. To tell spruce and fir trees apart, it helps to know that spruce needles are sharply pointed, square and easy to roll between your fingers. Fir needles, on the other hand, are softer, flat and cannot be rolled between your fingers. Spruce needles are attached to small, stalk-like woody projections.

While spruce needles tend to be shorter than those of pines -- roughly 1-inch long -- it's their notable stiffness that really gives them away.\n[5] Spruce Tree Scientific Name, Picea. Spruce trees are cone bearing trees and can therefore be classified as coniferous. Other coniferous trees include pine trees, Douglas Fir trees, redwood trees and cedar trees. Spruce Tree Types: List of Different Type of Spruce. Bird's Nest Spruce, dwarf variety of Norway Spruce.\n[6] Differences Between Spruce & Fir Trees. Spruce and fir trees are biologically close cousins that belong to the family of evergreens known as conifers, or cone-bearing trees. Both species inhabit northern or high-altitude regions where the weather is typically cold during winter. At one time both species were referred to as fir trees.\n[7] Overview. Alberta spruce trees (Picea glauca Conica) are small dwarf trees that are characterized by their vibrant green, tight, dense foliage, which gives the trees a slightly fuzzy appearance. They are evergreen conifers that grow to a maximum of 4 to 6 feet in height.Alberta spruce trees can be grown in many regions of the United States (between USDA hardiness zones 2 and 8). They are very popular landscape trees.verview.

It too is a tall tree that can reach up to 30 meters high. Some of its adaptations are branches that are shaped as a pyramid. This shape promotes the snow to slide of the branches to prevent branches being broken from the weight.\n[9] Overview. The white spruce is a tree native to extreme northern parts of the United States and grows in much of Canada. The Norway spruce is an introduced species that hails from Europe. Both of these spruce trees are fashionable landscaping species planted extensively for their attributes.\n[10] Picea abies 'Cupressina' - Columnar Norway Spruce. The species Norway Spruce originates from the mountains of central Europe, where it can be found at elevations as high as 6,000 ft. This cultivar, the Cupressina Norway Spruce, is fastigiate, meaning it is very narrow with a tight branching habit.Because of it's growth habit it's a prized selection on urban and suburban properties and in gardens where a strong, evergreen vertical element is required.Though it's classified as a dwarf, this conifer can be expected to grow to a height of 30'-40' in height and 8'-10' in diameter.ecause of it's growth habit it's a prized selection on urban and suburban properties and in gardens where a strong, evergreen vertical element is required. Though it's classified as a dwarf, this conifer can be expected to grow to a height of 30'-40' in height and 8'-10' in diameter.\n[11] Picea glauca. Picea glauca, the white spruce,[2] is a species of spruce native to the northern temperate and boreal forests in North America. Picea glauca was originally native from central Alaska all through the east, across southern/central Canada to the Avalon Peninsula in Newfoundland.\n[12] Sitka spruce, (Picea sitchensis,) known also as tideland spruce, coast spruce, and yellow spruce, is the largest of the world's spruces and is one of the most prominent forest trees in stands along the northwest coast of North America. Alaska didn't become a state, officially, until 1959. House Bill No. 325 proposed the Sitka spruce, the most valuable tree species in Alaska, as the official state tree of Alaska.\n[13] A taxonomic variety of white spruce, densata, can be found in the Black Hills of South Dakota and is often sold commercially as Black Hills spruce. The variety albertiana is sold as western white spruce or Alberta white spruce, although some experts believe it may be a form of densata.\n[14] Even the common dwarf forms such as `Dwarf Alberta, `Birds Nest and `Montgomery (at right) tend to grow much larger than many of us anticipate! As a reminder, spruce are easy to identify as theyre the only evergreen that has needles held individually on the stem that are square in cross section.\n[15] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping, however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe.runk of a black spruce. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (to 2.5 cm).\n[16] Picea sitchensis. Picea sitchensis, the Sitka spruce, is a large, coniferous, evergreen tree growing to almost 100 m (330 ft) tall,[1] and with a trunk diameter at breast height that can exceed 5 m (16 ft) (see List of superlative trees).\n[17] Product Description. Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On the average it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. Since it is a grafted plant , the growth rate can vary depending on the rootstock (understock) that it is grafted on to.\n[18] Examine the cones. The cones of a spruce tree are also a good way to identify the tree. Cones grow from tree branches and contain the seeds of a tree. Spruces, pines and firs all contain cones, as do other conifers like cedars and hemlock trees. Spruce cones have smooth, thin scales, and are quite flexible and easy to bend.\n[19] Pinaceae -- Pine family. Gilbert H. Fechner. Blue spruce (Picea pungens) is also called Colorado blue spruce, Colorado spruce, silver spruce, and pino real. It is a slow-growing, long-lived tree of medium size that, because of its symmetry and color, is planted extensively as an ornamental.n its northern range (northern Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana), blue spruce is found only in scattered locations under established stands of narrowleaf cottonwood and among scattered ponderosa pine, with Engelmann spruce and white spruce (Picea glauca) associated with the species in the extreme north (64,84).\n[20] Fir needles, on the other hand, are softer, flat and cannot be rolled between your fingers. Spruce needles are attached to small, stalk-like woody projections. When needles are shed, these projections remain. As a result, the branches of spruce trees feel rough.\nSearch Query: what is physical description of spruce.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

The needles, or leaves, of spruce trees are attached singly to the branches in a spiral fashion, each needle on a small peg-like structure called a pulvinus.hey are also used by the larvae of gall adelgids (Adelges species). In the mountains of western Sweden scientists have found a Norway spruce tree, nicknamed Old Tjikko, which by reproducing through layering has reached an age of 9,550 years and is claimed to be the world's oldest known living tree.\n[2] There is an isolated native population in the Black Hills that differs slightly from the general species. This population is known as Black Hills spruce (Picea glauca var. densata). Both have a dense pyramidal form with short (1/2\u00e2\u0080\u00b3-3/4\u00e2\u0080\u00b3), four sided, single, evergreen needles. The foliage of Black Hills spruce is a little more dense and darker green. They both can be adapted to many different planting sites with the Black Hills spruce being a little more adapted to harsher soil conditions.\n[3] Seeds. The white spruce is a large coniferous evergreen tree which grows normally to 15 to 30 metres (49 to 98 ft) tall, but can grow up to 40 m (130 ft) tall with a trunk diameter of up to 1 m (3.3 ft). The bark is thin and scaly, flaking off in small circular plates 5 to 10 centimetres (2.0 to 3.9 in) across.he bark of mature white spruce is scaly or flaky, gray-brown (Brayshaw 1960) or ash-brown (Harlow and Harrar 1950), but silvery when freshly exposed. Resin blisters are normally lacking, but the Porsild spruce Picea glauca var.\n[4] Spruces are large trees, from about 20\u00e2\u0080\u009360 metres (about 60\u00e2\u0080\u0093200 feet) tall when mature, and can be distinguished by their whorled branches and conical form. The needles, or leaves, of spruce trees are attached singly to the branches in a spiral fashion, each needle on a small peg-like structure.\n[5] Pine scales are noticeably thick, rigid and tough. Spruce bark typically feels rough when you run your hand across it, with a thin and scaly look that grows more furrowed as the tree ages. Pine bark in general is smooth when the tree is young but with age often develops a reddish-brown color and starts to flake.\n[6] Generally, they do, but look closer. Feel the needles. Spruces have stiff, prickly needles, while Douglas-firs and true firs have soft, flexible needles. Each spruce needle springs from a tiny, woody peg; in fact, this peg is one of the best ways to identify a spruce. Spruce cones hang down from the branches like those of Douglas-fir while true fir cones stand up, but spruce cones do not have Douglas-fir's pitchfork bracts. The scales of most spruce cones are papery thin--yet another difference. And spruce bark is scaly--Douglas-fir and the true firs have smooth or ridged bark. There are approximately 40 different species of spruce in the world, but only 3 are native to the Pacific Northwest--and only 2 of those are common. Location is probably the best clue to their identity. : grows only along the Pacific coast, from northern California through southeastern Alaska, and only near sea level.\n[7] Comments: Spruce Pine is one of the least common species of pine found in the southeastern United States, and is usually only found in scattered groups or as isolated trees within a mixed forest.

There are about 35 species of Spruce known in the northern temperate and boreal (taiga) regions of earth.\n[9] Spruce trees belong to the genus Picea and can grow up to heights that exceed 100 feet tall. Leaves: Spruce trees feature stiff needles which range in color from silvery-green to blue-green depending on the type of specimen. The needles often curve inward and measure about three quarters of an inch long.\n[10] Picea pungens, commonly called Colorado spruce (also blue spruce), is a medium to large, narrow, pyramidal conifer with horizontal branching to the ground.

Anoher notable characteristic for identification is that unlike the fascicles of pine trees, each pulvinus only holds one spruce needle. The pulvini are arranged in a whorl around the branch.\n[17] Full Definition of SPRUCE. 1. a: any of a genus (Picea) of evergreen trees of the pine family with a conical head of dense foliage, flat or 4-sided needles, pendulous cones, and soft light wood b: any of several coniferous trees (as Douglas fir) of similar habit. 2. : the wood of a spruce.\n[18] Firs are often distinguished from their spruce cousins through the characteristics of their needles. Those of spruce trees are rather firm and rectangular when cut in cross section, while fir-tree needles are softer, flatter, and two-sided. The cones of fir trees are erect and have scales that fall off in autumn.\n[19] Noteworthy Characteristics. Picea abies, commonly called Norway spruce, is a large pyramidal evergreen conifer that is native to the mountains of northern and central Europe east to the Urals. In its native European habitat, it typically matures to 100-150' (occasionally to 200') tall.\n[20] Picea abies, the Norway spruce, is a species of spruce native to Northern, Central and Eastern Europe.

It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age.\n[7] For other uses, see Spruce (disambiguation).

Customer margins are established individually based on the amount of risk Exposure and the size of the contract. Browse by Subjects.\n[3] Although they are the trailing edge of the continents, passive continental margins currently exist in the middle of plates, not at plate boundaries. Erosion is the primary force acting on them, having continually deposited sediment from dry land since their formation.\n[4] A margin balance occurs when the amount of a purchase or withdrawal is greater than the amount shown in your cash balance. 1 Zero balance: A zero margin balance means that you either aren't borrowing any money from TD Ameritrade or that you hold a positive or zero cash balance.\n[5] Profile illustrating the shelf, slope and rise. The continental margin is the zone of the ocean floor that separates the thin oceanic crust from thick continental crust.Together, the continental shelf, continental slope, and continental rise are called continental margin. Continental margins constitute about 28% of the oceanic area.arthquakes and volcanic eruptions are common on the west coast of North America, but there are no active volcanoes on the east coast and large magnitude earthquakes are rare. Geologists refer to the west coast as (tectonically) active continental margin and the east coast a passive continental margin.\n[6] The term margin, when used in accounting and financial reporting, refers to any of three profit lines on the income statement. A margin, specifically, is a profit figure expressed as a percentage of the company's net sales revenues.\n[7] DEFINITION of 'Maintenance Margin'. Maintenance margin is the minimum amount of equity that must be maintained in a margin account.\n[8] Answer by Santosh Nair. Confidence votes 91. An active cell is a cell presently been selected by the user, which is highlighted with a black colored border. An active cell is a cell presently been selected by the user, which is highlighted with a black colored border.\n[9] The maintenance margin is one such rule, and it stipulates the minimum amount of equity that must be in a margin account at all times. Equity, in the context of margin trading, is the total value of securities in the margin account minus what has been borrowed from the brokerage firm.\n[10] A diagram displaying equal margins of width 25mm on an A4 page. In typography, a margin is the area between the main content of a page and the page edges. The margin helps to define where a line of text begins and ends. When a page is justified the text is spread out to be flush with the left and right margins.\n[11] Active continental margins, i.e., when an oceanic plate subducts beneath a continent, represent about two-thirds of the modern convergent margins. Their cumulated length has been estimated to 45,000 km (Lallemand et al.,\n[12] A continental margin is the edge of a continent: A plate margin is the edge of a plate. Continents and plates are not the same thing. Continental margins are relevant because many people live near coasts. Plate margins are relevant becuase that's where plate interact.\n[13] Volcanic margins are usually distinguished from non-volcanic (or magma-poor) margins (e.g. the Iberian margin, Newfoundland margin) which do not contain large amounts of extrusive and/or intrusive rocks and may exhibit crustal features such as unroofed, serpentinized mantle .\n[14] There are four different perspectives needed to classify passive margins: 1 map-view formation geometry (rifted, sheared, and transtensional), 2 nature of transitional crust (volcanic and non-volcanic),\n[15] If a cost object such as a product or customer has a positive yellow margin, then: its red margin will be negative. its red margin will be zero. its red margin will be positive. its red margin may be either positive, negative, or zero. its red margin may be either positive, negative, or zero.\n[16] Phase margin and its important companion concept, gain margin, are measures of stability in closed-loop, dynamic-control systems. Phase margin indicates relative stability, the tendency to oscillate during its damped response to an input change such as a step function. Gain margin indicates absolute stability and the degree to which the system will oscillate, without limit, given any disturbance. The output signals of all amplifiers exhibit a time delay when compared to their input signals. This delay causes a phase difference between the amplifier's input and output signals.\n[17] Active management. Active management (also called active investing) refers to a portfolio management strategy where the manager makes specific investments with the goal of outperforming an investment benchmark index. In passive management, investors expect a return that closely replicates the investment weighting and returns of a benchmark index and will often invest in an index fund\n[18] To margin, also called buying on margin, refers to the practice of buying an asset where the buyer pays only a percentage of the asset's value and borrows the rest from the bank or broker. The broker acts as a lender, and he uses the funds in the securities account as collateral on the loan's balance.\n[19] The margin is the client's equity in the value of the portfolio or trading position. The client's trading limit is set at a multiple of the margin deposit. Margins can be in the form of cash and/or shares. However, margin shares must be on our list of marginable stocks.\n[20] Maintenance margin is the minimum amount of equity that must be maintained in a margin account.

Volcanoes, earthquakes, and topography reveal whether a continental margin is active or passive. In this activity, students use the GeoMapApp tool to work with earthquake, volcano, and topographic data to identify active and passive margins. 1 Utilize earthquake data to locate subducting slabs.\n[7] A continental margin that has a broad continental shelf, a gentle continental slope, and a pronounced continental rise is known as a passive continental margin. This type of margin experiences little, if any, volcanic or earthquake activity. The build-up of sediment is the primary activity affecting a passive margin.he continental shelf is the region that extends seaward from the shoreline to a sharp drop-off that marks the beginning of the continental slope. That drop-off is known as the continental shelf break. Continental shelves vary in width from 3 to 930 miles (5 to 1,500 kilometers).\n[8] Passive Continental Margins-A passive continental margin occurs in the interior of plate, far away from any plate boundary. Present examples of passive continental margins are the Atlantic coast of North and South America, Europe, and Africa.\n[9] the overall rate may be extremely slow one to ten centimeters per year but the long term effect is a continual re shaping of the surface of our planet an active continental margin is found on the leading edge of the continent where it is crashing into an oceanic platean excellent example is the west coast of south america active margins are commonly the sites of tectonic activity earthquakes volcanoes mountain building and the formation of new igneous rockhis is an easy one the earth s crust is broken into sections called plates there are two 2 basic types oceanic plates which are composed of basalt and continental plates which are mostly granite\n[10] All three margins are seismically active, with volcanic activity at constructive and destructive margins.

The main difference is that active margins are the main sites where tectonic activity takes place (lik \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 e earthquakes). This is because the continental shelf of active continental margins collide with an oceanic plate, creating subduction.\n[6] Cases of continental margins that are on or very close to a plate margin. Most continental margins around the Pacific are active. Key characteristics of active continental margins include the activity of volcanoes and earthquakes, narrow continental shelves, large coastal mountains, and much more.\n[7] 2 types of Continental Margins: Active continental margin and Passive continental margin \u00e2\u0080\u00a2Active Continental Margin \u00e2\u0080\u0093occur along plate boundaries (where plates are actively moving) \u00e2\u0080\u0093This is where mountain building takes place!! \u00e2\u0080\u0093Ex.)

A continental margin that has a very narrow, or even nonexistent, continental shelf and a narrow and steep continental slope is known as an active continental margin. Instead of ending in a continental rise, the continental slope of this type of margin often plunges into a deep-ocean trench, which may be filled with sediment.\n[9] A continental margin that has a broad continental shelf, a gentle continental slope, and a pronounced continental rise is known as a passive continental margin. This type of margin experiences little, if any, volcanic or earthquake activity. The build-up of sediment is the primary activity affecting a passive margin.\n[10] 1 A Continental Margin is a boundary between continental crust and oceanic crust. 2 Active continental margins occur along plate boundaries, while passive continental margins occur at the boundary that marks a continent and the oceanic crust. 3 Mountain building takes place along active continental margins only.\n[11] is an actual plate boundary, where oceanic crust and continental crust crash into each other.

The trench marks the deepest seaward termination of the active continental margin. It coincides with the surface trace of the subduction fault marking the boundary between the converging plates.\n[16] Active continental margins, i.e., when an oceanic plate subducts beneath a continent, represent about two-thirds of the modern convergent margins.

Nature of transitional crust Transitional crust, separating true oceanic and continental crusts, is the foundation of any passive margin.\n[18] In places along passive margins in the Atlantic Ocean, the sediment measures more than 6 miles (10 kilometers) deep. Because they are built seaward by the sediment, passive margins may also be called constructive margins.\n[19] passive continental margins currently exist in the middle of plates, not at plate boundaries. active continental margins form primarily along the boundaries of plates that are actively converging and where one plate is sinking beneath the other. Elizabeth H \u00c2\u00b7 6 years ago. Thumbs up.\n[20] A continental margin that has a broad continental shelf, a gentle continental slope, and a pronounced continental rise is known as a passive continental margin. This type of margin experiences little, if any, volcanic or earthquake activity. The build-up of sediment is the primary activity affecting a passive margin.he continental shelf is the region that extends seaward from the shoreline to a sharp drop-off that marks the beginning of the continental slope. That drop-off is known as the continental shelf break. Continental shelves vary in width from 3 to 930 miles (5 to 1,500 kilometers).\nSearch Query: what is a active margin.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: what is a active margin.\n\n[1] Best Answer: An active margin is a tectonic plate boundary, a passive margin is a compositional transition within a tectonic plate. As you probably know the theory of plate tectonics posits the outer layer of the Earth consist of plates which move relative to each other driven by convection in the Mantle.\n[2] An active plate margin is an actual plate boundary, where oceanic crust and continental crust crash into each other. Active plate margins are often the site of earthquakes and volcanoes. Oceanic crust created by seafloor spreading in the East Pacific Rise, for instance, may become part of the Ring of Fire, the horseshoe-shaped pattern of volcanoes and earthquake zones around the Pacific ocean basin.\n[3] An active continental margin refers to the submerged edge of a continent overriding an oceanic lithosphere at a convergent plate boundary by opposition with a passive continental margin which is the remaining scar at the edge of a continent following continental break-up.\n[4] \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Pacific = Active Margin geologic activity 11 The ocean floor can be classified as (a) Continental Margins \u00e2\u0080\u0093the submerged outer edge of a continent (b) Ocean Basin \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the deep seafloor beyond the continental margin There are two types of continental Margins (a)passive or trailing margins: margin of continent that moves away from spreading center \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Atlantic-style margins (also Artic Ocean, Antarctica and Indian Ocean). Very little volcanic or earthquake activity is associated with passive margins. (b) active or leading margins: plate boundary located along a continental margin \u00e2\u0080\u0093 ocean trenches where there is subduction of oceanic lithosphere \u00e2\u0080\u0093 narrow, steep, with volcanic mountains (West Coast of the Americas). Active margins are the site of volcanic and earthquake activity. 12 Continental Margins\n[5] An active continental margin is found on the leading edge of the continent where it is crashing into an oceanic plate. An excellent example is the west coast of South America. Active margins are commonly the sites of tectonic activity: earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain building, and the formation of new igneous rock.\n[6] rating newest oldest best answer an active continental margin is found on the leading edge of the continent where it is crashing into an oceanic plate an excellent example is the west coast of south americaactive margins are commonly the sites of tectonic activity earthquakes volcanoes mountain building and the formation of new igneous rockn excellent example is the west coast of south america active margins are commonly the sites of tectonic activity earthquakes volcanoes mountain building and the formation of new igneous rock\n[7] best answer an active continental margin is found on the leading edge of the continent where it is crashing into an oceanic platean excellent example is the west coast of south americaactive margins are commonly the sites of tectonic activity earthquakes volcanoes mountain building and the formation of new igneous rockn excellent example is the west coast of south america active margins are commonly the sites of tectonic activity earthquakes volcanoes mountain building and the formation of new igneous rock\n[8] The overall rate may be extremely slow (one to ten centimeters per year), but the long term effect is a continual re-shaping of the surface of our planet. An active continental margin is found on the leading edge of the continent where it is crashing into an oceanic plate. An excellent example is the west coast of South America. Active margins are commonly the sites of tectonic activity: earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain building, and the formation of new igneous rock.\n[9] Passive margin. A passive margin is the transition between oceanic and continental lithosphere that is not an active plate margin. A passive margin forms by sedimentation above an ancient rift, now marked by transitional lithosphere. Continental rifting creates new ocean basins.\n[10] Making the world better, one answer at a time. Passive continental margins are not areas of convergence. There is little volcanic and earthquake activity on passive margins. Active margins are areas of convergence where one plate is descending beneath another. They are associated with volcanic and earthquake activity.\n[11] Two types of continental margins exist: active margins and passive margins. Active margins form primarily along the boundaries of plates that are actively converging. Passive margins currently exist in the middle of plates, not at plate boundaries.\n[12] Active continental margins form primarily along the boundaries of plates that are actively converging and where one plate is sinking beneath the other. Active margins mark the continents that border the Pacific Ocean where oceanic plates are subducting beneath continental plates.assive continental margin: A continental margin that has a broad continental shelf, a gentle continental slope, and a pronounced continental rise; it is marked by a lack of earthquake and volcanic activity. Plates: Large sections of Earth's lithosphere separated by deep fault zones.\n[13] Active Margins. occur where oceanic lithosphere is being subducted beneath the edge of the continent. the result is a relatively narrow margin that consists of highly deformed sediment that was scraped from the decending lithospheric slab and plastered against the margin of the overriding continent.\n[14] Both passive and active continental margins are located near coastlines. The main difference is that active margins are the main sites where tectonic activity takes place (lik \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 e earthquakes). This is because the continental shelf of active continental margins collide with an oceanic plate, creating subduction.\n[15] Cases of continental margins that are on or very close to a plate margin. Most continental margins around the Pacific are active. Key characteristics of active continental margins include the activity of volcanoes and earthquakes, narrow continental shelves, large coastal mountains, and much more.\n[16] 2 types of Continental Margins: Active continental margin and Passive continental margin \u00e2\u0080\u00a2Active Continental Margin \u00e2\u0080\u0093occur along plate boundaries (where plates are actively moving) \u00e2\u0080\u0093This is where mountain building takes place!! \u00e2\u0080\u0093Ex.)

The basic method of reducing wind erosion is to keep the soil protected. with surface residues. While applicable to all areas, surface residues are. more widely accepted in cropping areas where they do not cause planting or. harvesting problems.\n[17] Bare fields are especially at risk of wind erosion in late winter and spring at the end of the fallow period, and immediately after seeding of the next crop. The best way to conserve soil moisture and prevent wind erosion is to leave as much crop residue cover as possible during the fallow period. The crop residue cover reduces evaporation, and standing stubble traps snow for extra spring soil moisture.\n[18] Soil and water[edit] No-till farming improves soil quality (soil function), carbon, organic matter, aggregates, protecting the soil from erosion, evaporation of water, and structural breakdown. A reduction in tillage passes helps prevent the compaction of soil.\n[19] The deep plow is used for working soil to a depth of 40 cm in vineyards, orchards, and forest stands. The orchard disk plow is used for plowing the soil between the rows in orchards and is equipped with a device that enables it to be shifted to the side. This makes it possible to work the soil beneath mature trees.\n[20] A lack of consistent positive yield response may be due to: 1 Insufficient depth of subsoiling. 2 Ineffective removal of compacted layer due to high soil moisture levels. 3 Recompaction of loosened soil by subsequent wheel traffic. 4 Deterioration of some soil properties by the subsoiling operation.\nSearch Query: what can contour plowing reduce.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Though the soil does stay cooler until a little later in the spring because of the insulating layer of residue, the day/night soil temperature fluctuations are smaller.\n[2] The chisel plough is a common tool to get deep tillage (prepared land) with limited soil disruption. The main function of this plough is to loosen and aerate the soils while leaving crop residue at the top of the soil. This plough can be used to reduce the effects of compaction and to help break up ploughpan and hardpan.\n[3] roads, coverage tends to be reduced or eliminated at night, and salt is mixed with abrasives to reduce salt use by at least 25 percent. These policies generally do not limit the frequency of application.\n[4] Plowing allows water and air to enter the soil, it also allows humus (organic matter) to be plowed into the soil so that earthworms can have access to.\n[5] Therefore, even though the soil may contain sufficient moisture and nutrients, the plant can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t extract them. The study notes that compaction reduced crop yields by as much as 50% in some areas. Compacted and uncompacted plots in spring 2011 and installation process of soil temperature sensors.\n[6] As opposed to the traditional and ancient ard, the plough with its mouldboard, share and coulter was able to cut through the clay soils of Northern and Central Europe. Thus the introduction of the plough \u00e2\u0080\u0093 according to White \u00e2\u0080\u0093 made an extensive cultivation of the Northern and Eastern wilderness possible.\n[7] At the plot scale, vegetation helps reduce soil loss not only by reducing runoff volume, but also by changing the runoff-sediment yield relationship, resulting that the sediment-reduction rate is higher than the runoff-reduction rate. At the watershed scale, gully erosion and mass wasting process are dominant.\n[8] cultivation or grazing on soils susceptible to gully erosion. increased runoff from land use changes such as tree clearing in a catchment or construction of new residential areas. runoff concentration caused by furrows, contour banks, waterways, dam bywashes, stock pads, fences, tracks or roads.\n[9] Cultivator teeth work near the surface, usually for weed control, whereas chisel plow shanks work deep beneath the surface, breaking up hardpan. Consequently, cultivating also takes much less power per shank than does chisel plowing.mall tilling equipment, used in small gardens such as household gardens and small commercial gardens, can provide both primary and secondary tillage. For example, a rotary tiller does both the plowing and the harrowing, preparing a smooth, loose seedbed.\n[10] Higher plant populations, no-till soybeans, and genetically modified crops with tougher stalks and stems that don't deteriorate as fast over winter as conventional hybrids do are all to blame for increased amounts of residue. Farmers like the Koenigs are finding that a disc harrow can be their best defense. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are customers out there saying, \u00e2\u0080\u0098There was way too much residue last year, and I don't want to deal with it again this spring,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Matt Weinheimer, marketing manager for tillage, John Deere Des Moines Works.\n[11] Soil and water[edit] No-till farming improves soil quality (soil function), carbon, organic matter, aggregates, protecting the soil from erosion, evaporation of water, and structural breakdown.

Conservation tillage is especially suitable for erosion-prone cropland. In some agricultural regions it has become more common than traditional moldboard plowing. Conservation tillage methods include no-till, strip-till, ridge-till and mulch-till. Each method requires different types of specialized or modified equipment and adaptations in management. No-till and strip-till involve planting crops directly into residue that either hasn't been tilled at all (no-till) or has been tilled only in narrow strips with the rest of the field left untilled (strip-till).\n[2] Best management practices that encourage infiltration of surface water into the soil will be most effective in reducing atrazine losses in runoff. Research shows that light incorporation, or tillage, increases infiltration and can reduce offsite movement of atrazine.\n[3] Enhanced Canola Helps Farmers Conserve Soil and Save Fuel. Thanks to new canola varieties improved through biotechnology, farmers can more frequently practice conservation tillage \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a method of weed control that reduces their need to plow. Less plowing means less erosion, less run-off and fewer trips across the field.\n[4] The basic principle behind preventing any erosion is find a way to lessen the impact of the cause, such as rain and wind. For prevention of rain-driven erosion, it is important to anchor the dirt down, such as with grass, or prevent water from collecting and picking up dirt as it flows down slope. A common way to prevent this is contour ploughing. What is... Making slopes into steps so that rain cannot run down a hill carrying soil off. When building terraces, it is important to stabilize the slope. -The easiest way to do this is to plant grass. If there is enough rock around it may be possible to construct a wall out of them. Contour Ploughing- Similar to terracing, except that it follows the contours of a hill more closely than terracing, possibly even encircling a hill top The contours are not wide like terraces.\n[5] With a one-bottom plow you'll make one furrow at a time, with a two-bottom plow two at a time, and so on. Since a two-bottom plow will cut the number of passes you have to make up and down the field by 50 percent, it's well worth getting if you can. But again, don't buy a bigger plow than your tractor can handle.low. You may find your first major tractor attachment, the plow, comes with the tractor. This is because of the two major types, trailer plows and mounted plows ... the latter, as its name implies, comes mounted on the tractor. If they don't come as a combination, you'll probably have to get a trailer plow.\n[6] Federal rule could impose wetland permit mandates on plowing a field.

When farmers plow their land, it produces grooves called \u00e2\u0080\u009cfurrows,\u00e2\u0080\u009d bordered by small ridges of dirt.\n[7] 1 waterlogged soil, which bans the use of tractors and other motor vehicles on waterlogged land, in order to maintain soil structure and prevent compaction. burning of crop residues, which bans the burning of many combinable crop residues, in order to maintain soil organic matter and protect landscape features.\n[8] 1 Tillage erosion moves soil down slope to areas where water erosion is most intense, so tillage erosion is linked to water contamination. 2 Maximum tolerable loss: 5 tons/acre/year (10 tonnes/hectare/year) = 0.03 inches (0.75 millimetres) thickness of topsoil on a well-developed soil.\n[9] In general, land management practices that retain vegetation cover (such as trees, crop residue or pasture) and involve minimal soil disturbance tend to lower the potential for wind erosion. Adequate crop residue (shown left) prevents wind erosion that can occur when there is inadequate crop residue (shown right).\n[10] General-purpose plows are used for the primary plowing of soil to a depth of 20\u00e2\u0080\u009330 cm. For inthrow and outthrow plowing, plow bottoms that turn the soil to the right are mounted on the plow frames. Flat plowing is done with reversible, pickup, and shuttle plows.\n[11] One of the best ways to prevent soil erosion is to increase vegetation, which locks in the soil particles and breaks up damaging winds.

Though the soil does stay cooler until a little later in the spring because of the insulating layer of residue, the day/night soil temperature fluctuations are smaller.\n[17] Therefore, even though the soil may contain sufficient moisture and nutrients, the plant can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t extract them. The study notes that compaction reduced crop yields by as much as 50% in some areas. Compacted and uncompacted plots in spring 2011 and installation process of soil temperature sensors.\n[18] The objective of tillage (mechanical manipulation of the soil) is to improve tilth, thereby increasing crop production; in the long term, however, conventional tillage, especially plowing, often has the opposite effect, causing the soil to break down and become compacted.\n[19] The chisel plough is a common tool to get deep tillage (prepared land) with limited soil disruption. The main function of this plough is to loosen and aerate the soils while leaving crop residue at the top of the soil. This plough can be used to reduce the effects of compaction and to help break up ploughpan and hardpan.\n[20] Cultivator teeth work near the surface, usually for weed control, whereas chisel plow shanks work deep beneath the surface, breaking up hardpan. Consequently, cultivating also takes much less power per shank than does chisel plowing.mall tilling equipment, used in small gardens such as household gardens and small commercial gardens, can provide both primary and secondary tillage. For example, a rotary tiller does both the plowing and the harrowing, preparing a smooth, loose seedbed.\nSearch Query: what can contour plowing reduce.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Since atrazine moves from treated fields dissolved in runoff water, conservation tillage practices that increase water infiltration into the soil profile may help slow herbicide runoff into surface water.\n[2] Conservation tillage systems (described below) can be an important part of a sustainable agricultural system, in that they can be used to decrease soil erosion losses ordinarily associated with typical US agricultural practices.onservation tillage is basically any system of cultivating that reduces soil or water loss when compared to conventional moldboard plowing, which turns over the soil completely.\n[3] 1 Root crop harvesting can cause more tillage erosion than plowing. 2 The majority of soil moved by tillage is only moved 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 centimetres), but some soil will be dragged as far as 6 to 10 feet (2 to 3 metres) and greater distances when tilling down slope.\n[4] Soil conservation practices include minimum and no-tillage, which maintain high levels of crop residues on the soil surface and reduce heavy machinery traffic. Crop rotation and periodic use of clover or alfalfa hay crops increase soil organic matter and lead to improved soil structure and fewer compaction problems.\n[5] Contour farming, Minimum-tillage farming (Conservation tillage), No-till farming, Terracing, Strip cropping, Cover crops, Alley cropping (agroforestry), Grassed waterways & gully control, Planting perennial crops, Using drip irrigation vs conventional irrigation, Windbreaks, Shelterbelts, Land classifications that establish what lands are farmable due to slope, Stubble mulching, Snow management.\n[6] Ploughing. The influence of the plough on the soil is relatively slight. It is not necessary to lower the groundwater table when this method is used.

It is not necessary to lower the groundwater table when this method is used. This procedure is therefore extremely environmentally friendly, due not least of all to the only slight ground damage caused.\n[7] Reducing the velocity of water moving across the soil surface will reduce water erosion. This may be accomplished by using strip cropping. In strip cropping a row crop such as corn is planted in strips that alternate with strips of a forage crop such as alfalfa or grass hay.\n[8] With conventional tillage (complete turning over of the soil), the bare soil is exposed to the erosive action of water, which, in many areas is the major route of soil loss. Under conservation tillage, the crop residue buffers the raindrops' energy, so water has less erosive force when it reaches the soil.onservation tillage is basically any system of cultivating that reduces soil or water loss when compared to conventional moldboard plowing, which turns over the soil completely.\n[9] Plowing and planting across the changing slope of land, rather than in straight lines, to help retain water and reduce soil erosion. Method for reducing soil erosion; plant stalks are left in the field after harvesting and the next year's crop is planted within the stalks without plowing.\n[10] Another study estimated a reduction in labor by as much as 50 percent compared to tillage. Climate change benefits. The benefits in reducing farming\u00e2\u0080\u0099s global warming footprint are immense. Fuel costs saved by running the tractor less, one estimate suggests, no-till can reduce fuel usage by as much as 80 percent. In addition to the reduced carbon emissions from mechanical equipment used in no-till farming, there are several other benefits to the environment.\n[11] The basic principle behind preventing any erosion is find a way to lessen the impact of the cause, such as rain and wind. For prevention of rain-driven erosion, it is important to anchor the dirt down, such as with grass, or prevent water from collecting and picking up dirt as it flows down slope. A common way to prevent this is contour ploughing. What is... Making slopes into steps so that rain cannot run down a hill carrying soil off. When building terraces, it is important to stabilize the slope. -The easiest way to do this is to plant grass. If there is enough rock around it may be possible to construct a wall out of them. Contour Ploughing- Similar to terracing, except that it follows the contours of a hill more closely than terracing, possibly even encircling a hill top The contours are not wide like terraces.\n[12] One of the best ways to prevent soil erosion is to increase vegetation, which locks in the soil particles and breaks up damaging winds. Terracing is an option for controlling erosion on sloped land by cutting in flat surfaces.\n[13] Bare fields are especially at risk of wind erosion in late winter and spring at the end of the fallow period, and immediately after seeding of the next crop. The best way to conserve soil moisture and prevent wind erosion is to leave as much crop residue cover as possible during the fallow period. The crop residue cover reduces evaporation, and standing stubble traps snow for extra spring soil moisture.\n[14] Some conservation tillage methods forego traditional tillage entirely and leave 70% residue or more. Conservation tillage is especially suitable for erosion-prone cropland. In some agricultural regions it has become more common than traditional moldboard plowing. Conservation tillage methods include no-till, strip-till, ridge-till and mulch-till. Each method requires different types of specialized or modified equipment and adaptations in management. No-till and strip-till involve planting crops directly into residue that either hasn't been tilled at all (no-till) or has been tilled only in narrow strips with the rest of the field left untilled (strip-till).\n[15] Best management practices that encourage infiltration of surface water into the soil will be most effective in reducing atrazine losses in runoff. Research shows that light incorporation, or tillage, increases infiltration and can reduce offsite movement of atrazine.\n[16] Enhanced Canola Helps Farmers Conserve Soil and Save Fuel. Thanks to new canola varieties improved through biotechnology, farmers can more frequently practice conservation tillage \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a method of weed control that reduces their need to plow. Less plowing means less erosion, less run-off and fewer trips across the field.\n[17] In general, land management practices that retain vegetation cover (such as trees, crop residue or pasture) and involve minimal soil disturbance tend to lower the potential for wind erosion. Adequate crop residue (shown left) prevents wind erosion that can occur when there is inadequate crop residue (shown right).\n[18] A problem that occurs in some fields is water saturation in soils. Switching to no-till farming will correct the drainage the because of the qualities of soil under continuous no-till include a higher water infiltration rate.\n[19] Soil and water[edit] No-till farming improves soil quality (soil function), carbon, organic matter, aggregates, protecting the soil from erosion, evaporation of water, and structural breakdown. A reduction in tillage passes helps prevent the compaction of soil.\n[20] In many agricultural regions it can reduce or eliminate soil erosion.

Direction. Tillage implements like a plow or disc throw soil either up or down slope, depending on the direction of tillage.\n[9] Deep, frequent tillage creates a layer of compact soil vulnerable to water erosion, topped by loose soil easily removed by wind. Consider a zero-tillage approach using a coulter or other deep planting device. If this is not feasible, try a ridge-till or mulch-till system that leaves the lower soil levels untouched.\n[10] Further, in terms of the size of the crop, the plough \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in contrast to the ard \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not only turns the soil and buries the weed, it also brings the lower soil, where the nutrients have been trapped, to the surface.\n[11] The basic principle behind preventing any erosion is find a way to lessen the impact of the cause, such as rain and wind.

Contour plowing (or contour ploughing) or contour farming is the farming practice of plowing across a slope following its elevation contour lines. The rows form slow water run-off during rainstorms to prevent soil erosion and allow the water time to settle into the soil.\n[2] In contour ploughing, the ruts made by the plow run perpendicular rather than parallel to slopes, generally resulting in furrows that curve around the land and are level. This method is also known for preventing tillage erosion. Tillage erosion is the soil movement and erosion by tilling a given plot of land. A similar practice is contour bunding where stones are placed around the contours of slopes.\n[3] However, when the compacted layer is tilled with a moldboard or chisel plow, the resulting rough, cloddy surface can decrease runoff and erosion. While it sounds contradictory, both effects are possible, depending on the soil and soil conditions encountered.\n[4] Crop rotation, strip farming, terracing and contour plowing became tools for better land and water resource management.

Contour ploughing or contour farming is the farming practice of ploughing and/or planting across a slope following its elevation contour lines.\n[8] Best Answer: The benefits of plowing are primarily weed control, turning under crop residues so that it breaks down faster, and preparing a good clean area for planting seed. These same benefits of the plow have been shown over the years to have a negative effect on the soil environment. The plow is quickly becoming an implement of the past.\n[9] Both contour plowing and terrace farming are suitable for cultivating lands on sloping hills. Both are used to reduce soil erosion from tilled fields on slopes. In terrace farming, physical barriers (trenches, stone bunds, live hedges, or natural strips) are created along the contours to retain rain water and make it infiltrate into the soil and to minimize soil erosion.\n[10] Safeopedia explains Contour Plowing. Contour farming is done in hilly and sloped areas. Farmers who practice contour farming start by cutting levels into the hill or contoured area. This creates a series of steps on the hill on which crops are grown.\n[11] Conservation tillage can be an economical option for farmers, plus provides a number of potential environmental benefits: 1 Reduced plowing makes cropland much less vulnerable to soil erosion: conservation tillage reduces soil erosion by as much as 90 percent, compared to systems using intensive tillage.\n[12] Contour plowing, Pennsylvania, 1938. Contour bunding, Catalonia, 2007. Contour ploughing or contour farming or Contour bunding is the farming practice of plowing and/or planting across a slope following its elevation contour lines.\n[13] \u00e2\u0080\u0098Educators need the equivalent of the tractor, contour plowing, and hybridization.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Crop rotation, contour plowing, and the careful use of fertilizers and pest controls increased productivity, but the same techniques made it easier for bigger farms to become even more productive.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n[14] Tilling the field at right angles to the natural slope after drawing up the elevation contour lines is called contour ploughing in soil, prevents and reduces soil erosion. Terrace Farming In terracing, wide steps are cut around the slopes of hills to prevent soil erosion. Contour ploughing follows the \u00e2\u0080\u009cnatural shape\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the slope without altering it. Terrace farming alters the shape of the slope to produce flat areas that provide a catchment for water.\n[15] Contour Plowing & Terraces The Soil Erosion Service was one of the federal programs started in the 1930s to save the land that had been destroyed by years of wind erosion, over plowing, and over grazing. The commission taught farmers how to use terracing and contour plowing techniques to preserve the soil.\n[16] Develop practices sustainable management of soils with the use of green roofs, paths, contour plowing and incorporation of natural barriers and minimum tillage. This may include a good system of farmer extension services, better nutrient management, contour plowing, improved seed varieties or simple irrigation.\n[17] Contour plowing and terracing are both types of farming techniques.Contour plowing follows the natural shape of the land form withoutchanging it whereas terracing changes the shape of the slope todevelop flat areas for crop growth.\n[18] For prevention of rain-driven erosion, it is important to anchor the dirt down, such as with grass, or prevent water from collecting and picking up dirt as it flows down slope. A common way to prevent this is contour ploughing. images with permission by Dr. J. Floor Anthoni. What is...\n[19] Tillage and planting practices that reduce erosion include contour cultivation and strip-cropping. Contour cultivation is cultivation that follows the contours of a field, producing furrows that run perpendicular or at angles to the slope-line of a field.heet erosion is caused by raindrops. Sheet erosion is defined as the uniform removal of soil in thin layers from sloping land. This, of course, is nearly impossible; in reality the loose soil merely runs off with the rain.\n[20] Freebase(0.00 / 0 votes)Rate this definition: Contour plowing.

Furrows that do not follow the lay of the land cause rapid runoff during rainfall by forming a convenient channel for the water to flow downhill.\n[2] In contour plowing, the land is plowed across the slopes and along the contour lines. This will also reduce soil erosion and make rainwater infiltrate into the soil more than on land plowed along the slope. Terraces are more effective than contour plowing alone in minimizing soil erosion and facilitating infiltration f rainfall into the soil.\n[3] Contour plowing was a method of plowing furrows that follow the curves of the land rather than straight up and down slopes. Furrows that run up and down a slope form a channel that can quickly carry away seeds and topsoil. Contour plowing forms ridges, slows the water flow and helps save precious topsoil. LeRoy Hoffman rented farmland for his entire farming career and remembers when the government urged farmers to change their plowing methods.\n[4] Contour plowing is the act of farming on a hill or a contoured area. The plow follows the contours of the land horizontally helping to reduce runoff of water. This practice helps to prevent soil erosion in hilly and contoured areas by capturing the water runoff using water breaks to keep water contained. Contour plowing is also known as contour farming, and is a sustainable form of agriculture.\n[5] Contour plowing is also promoted in countries with similar rainfall patterns to the United States such as western Canada and Australia. The practice is effective only on slopes with between 2% and 10% gradient and when rainfall does not exceed a certain amount within a certain period.\n[6] Contour plowing. Contour ploughing or contour farming is the farming practice of ploughing and/or planting across a slope following its elevation contour lines. These contour lines create a water break which reduces the formation of rills and gullies during times of heavy water run-off; which is a major cause of top soil loss and soil erosion.\n[7] Contour plowing Contour ploughing or contour farming is the farming practice of ploughing and/or planting across a slope following its elevation contour lines.

These contour lines create a water break which reduces the formation of rills and gullies during times of heavy water run-off; which is a major cause of soil erosion.\n[10] One of the earliest methods of conservation tillage came to be known as contour plowing, or plowing on the contour. Tilling the soil along the gentle slopes of a piece of cropland, instead of up and down the gradient, prevents fertile topsoil from being carried downhill by flowing rainwater.\n[11] Contour bunding, Catalonia, 2007. Contour plowing (or contour ploughing) or contour farming is the farming practice of plowing across a slope following its elevation contour lines. The rows form slow water run-off during rainstorms to prevent soil erosion and allow the water time to settle into the soil.\n[12] In contour ploughing, the ruts made by the plow run perpendicular rather than parallel to slopes, generally resulting in furrows that curve around the land and are level. This method is also known for preventing tillage erosion. Tillage erosion is the soil movement and erosion by tilling a given plot of land. A similar practice is contour bunding where stones are placed around the contours of slopes.\n[13] Both contour plowing and terrace farming are suitable for cultivating lands on sloping hills. Both are used to reduce soil erosion from tilled fields on slopes. In terrace farming, physical barriers (trenches, stone bunds, live hedges, or natural strips) are created along the contours to retain rain water and make it infiltrate into the soil and to minimize soil erosion.\n[14] Tilling the field at right angles to the natural slope after drawing up the elevation contour lines is called contour ploughing in soil, prevents and reduces soil erosion.

Each year, an estimated 10,000 to 18,000 people are infected with the Legionella bacteria in the United States.\n[11] Legionella bacteria tend to grow in the lower temperatures at the bottom of water heater; such bacteria can cause a form of pneumonia. The organism is generally transmitted when people inhale contaminated water droplets from whirlpool baths, showers or building air conditioning systems.\n[12] Legionellosis is an infection that is caused by the bacterium Legionella pneumophila. Legionnaires' disease is the more severe form of the infection, which may involve pneumonia. The onset of this form of the disease is usually two to 10 days after infection but can occur up to 16 days later.\n[13] What Is Legionnaires' Disease. Legionnaires\u00e2\u0080\u0099 disease, or Legionellosis, is a severe infection caused by Legionella species, primarily L. pneumophila.

Jefferson, Adams, Franklin, Sherman, and Livingston formed a commitee to form a list of complaints that declared a want for independence from England. It was finished and signed on July 2nd, 1776, which is when Declaration was actually declared. July 4th, 1776, it was made known to the public, and ever since then, people have celebrated Independence on the 4th of July.

The United States of America was never truly founded as much as it was declared independent from the Kingdom of Great Britain on July 4, 1776.

As with somatic pain, pain receptors called nociceptors send signals to the spinal cord and brain when damage is detected. Unlike somatic pain, however, visceral pain is harder to pinpoint in terms of location within the body. Some types of pelvic pain and abdominal pain, such as those caused by bladder disorders or irritable bowel syndrome, are considered to be visceral pain disorders.\n[2] The visceral layer is usually thin, delicate, and not apparently separate, but instead seems to be the outer surface of the structure itself. See also: serosa.\n[3] Visceral pain is pain that originates from an organ within the body. The organs in the body lack other types of receptors for the different stimuli like touch and heat. This allows the organs to continue with various involuntary activities without the person being aware of it.\n[4] Visceral Pain. Visceral pain is the pain we feel when our internal organs are damaged or injured and is by far the most common form of pain. Viscera refers to the internal areas of the body that are enclosed in a cavity. Visceral pain is caused by the activation of pain receptors in the chest, abdomen or pelvic areas.t is much more subjective and not easily described as acute pain. The three pain types can be felt at the same time or singly and at different times. The different types of pain respond differently to the various pain medications.
