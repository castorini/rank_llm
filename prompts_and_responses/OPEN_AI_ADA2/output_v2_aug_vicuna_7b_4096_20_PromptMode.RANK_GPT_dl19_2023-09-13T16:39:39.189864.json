Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: how long is life cycle of flea.\n\n[1] The total flea life cycle can range from a couple weeks to several months, depending on environmental conditions. ADULT: The adult flea is very flat side to side. There are hair-like bristles on the flea body and legs to aid in their navigation through pet hair.\n[2] The life cycle of a flea can last anywhere from 20 days to an entire year. It depends on how long the flea remains in the dormant stage (eggs, larvae, pupa). Outside influences, such as weather, affect the flea cycle. A female flea can lay around 20 to 25 eggs in one day.\n[3] The life cycle of a flea can last anywhere from 20 days to an entire year. It depends on how long the flea remains in the dormant stage (eggs, larvae, pupa). Outside influences, such as weather, affect the flea cycle. A female flea can lay around 20 to 25 eggs in one day. The flea egg stage is the beginning of the flea cycle. This part of the flea cycle represents a little more than one third of the flea population at any given time. Depending on the temperature and humidity of the environment the egg can take from two to six days to hatch.\n[4] Life Cycle (Back to Top). The cat flea life cycle is one of complete metamorphosis, involving the stages of an egg, larva, pupa, and adult. This cycle usually lasts 30 to 75 days, yet may vary due to external factors, such as temperature and humidity.\n[5] Stickfast flea life history. The complete life cycle of the flea takes about four weeks, varying according to the temperature. The female fleas lay at night while attached to the bird, and the very small eggs fall to the ground. In about four days, small wormlike larvae emerge from the eggs. The larvae feed on organic material, mainly the dried blood excreted by the adult fleas, and shelter in the surface dust and litter on the soil. After several moults, they grow to about 3 mm, cease to feed and burrow down into the soil to a depth of about 15 cm.\n[6] There are four stages in a flea's life: egg, larva (maggoty-like-thing), pupa (in a cocoon) and adult. Egg-to-egg life cycle is usually two to four weeks. Under the right conditions this can be a little shorter (12 days), or much longer (8 months).\n[7] Stickfast flea life history. The complete life cycle of the flea takes about four weeks, varying according to the temperature. The female fleas lay at night while attached to the bird, and the very small eggs fall to the ground. In about four days, small wormlike larvae emerge from the eggs. The larvae feed on organic material, mainly the dried blood excreted by the adult fleas, and shelter in the surface dust and litter on the soil.\n[8] Under ideal conditions, the cat flea life cycle takes just 18 days, from egg to adult. Adult fleas (both male and female) require a blood meal prior to mating. They prefer blood from your pet, but in the absence of a canine or feline host, fleas will bite people.\n[9] The time it takes to complete the life cycle from egg to adult varies from two weeks to eight months, depending on the temperature, humidity and the amount of food available. A typical flea population consists of 50 per cent eggs, 35 per cent larvae, ten per cent pupae and only five per cent adults.\n[10] When it comes to eliminating fleas from your pet and from your home, there are some key things to consider. One of the most important things is life cycle of the flea, which depending on the environmental temperature and humidity levels can take between a couple of week to many months. There are four stages in the life cycle of a flea: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Here we will discuss all four\u2026.\n[11] Completion of the life cycle from egg to adult varies from two weeks to eight months. Normally the female flea lays about 15 to 20 eggs per day up to 600 in a lifetime. Usual hosts for fleas are dogs, cats, rats, rabbits, mice, squirrels, chipmunks, raccoons, opossums, foxes, chickens, and humans.\n[12] The life cycle depends on the humidity and temperature of your house: The eggs hatch in 1-6 days. They will be in the carpet, the furniture and are in highest numbers where she spends most of her time. The eggs hatch to become larvae. They molt and have 3 stages. The total time for this stage is 6-36 days. The pupae is a cocoon that the larvae goes into. The cocoon takes about 7-10 days to develop but then can be dormant for a long time until a host enters the situation (such as a cat). The adult flea is really only on the pet for about 2 weeks. The rest of the time is spent off the pet.\n[13] The flea life cycle has four stages: Egg: An adult female flea can lay up to 40 eggs a day. The eggs are laid on the host \u200bbut will dry and fall off that host into the environment (pet bedding, carpet, etc). Eggs typically hatch within about two days.\n[14] 1 Completion of the life cycle from egg to adult varies from two weeks to eight months. Normally the female flea lays about 15 to 20 eggs per day up to 600 in a lifetime.\n[15] The cat flea's life cycle is one of complete metamorphosis: an egg stage, larval (grub) stage, pupal (cocoon) stage and adult stage. The cat flea's life cycle usually lasts from about 1 to 2 \u00bd months and depends on the temperature and humidity of their habitat. Adults are the only stage that lives on the host, and the female adult cat flea must have a fresh blood meal in order to produce a new batch of eggs.\n[16] There are four stages in the life cycle of a flea: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Depending on the environmental temperature and humidity levels, the total life cycle will take anywhere from a couple weeks to many months. Optimal conditions for fleas are between 70-85\u00b0F and 70 percent humidity.\n[17] The lifecycle of a flea. 5% of fleas live in the environment as an adult, 95 % of fleas live as eggs, larvae or pupae. For effective flea control it is essential to break the lifecycle in the environment. 1 Adult Fleas-jump onto your dog or cat, feed on its blood and then start laying eggs. One flea broke a record with a four-foot vertical jump. 2 Undisturbed and without a blood meal, a flea can live more than 100 days. 3 On average, they live two to three months. 4 Female fleas cannot lay eggs until after their first blood meal and begin to lay eggs within 36-48 hours after that meal.\n[18] 1 Completion of the life cycle from egg to adult varies from two weeks to eight months. 2 Normally the female flea lays about 15 to 20 eggs per day up to 600 in a lifetime. Usual hosts for fleas are dogs, cats, rats, rabbits, mice, squirrels, chipmunks, raccoons, opossums, foxes, chickens, and humans.\n[19] The flea life cycle. Adult fleas spend most of their time on your dog or cat. They can live up to two years and a female will start laying eggs within two days of finding a host. The eggs that are laid by females fall off the cat or dog into the environment along with 'flea dirts' (flea excrement).\n[20] Fleas have four life stages, lasting weeks or months, depending on the environment. An adult flea can live up to two weeks without a host.

A declaratory judgment may only be granted in justiciable controversies\u2014that is, in actual, rather than hypothetical, controversies that fall within a court's jurisdiction.\n[8] A declaratory judgment does not provide for any enforcement, however. In other words, it states the court's authoritative opinion regarding the exact nature of the legal matter without requiring the parties to do anything.\n[9] The declaratory judgment is generally considered a statutory remedy and not an equitable remedy in the United States, and is thus not subject to equitable requirements, though there are analogies that can be found in the remedies granted by courts of equity.\n[10] An action or proceeding is not open to objection on the ground that a declaratory judgment or decree is prayed for.

Source: Flickr/Dana Spiegel. Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are both methods that provide wireless communication, but the difference between the two mainly stems from what they are designed to do and how they are used. The main difference is that Bluetooth is primarily used to connect devices without using cables, while Wi-Fi provides high-speed access to the internet. Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard that is used to exchange data over short distances (less than 30 feet), usually between personal mobile devices.\n[2] Bluetooth and WiFi are different standards for wireless communication. Bluetooth technology is useful when transferring information between two or more devices that are near each other when speed is not an issue, such as telephones, printers, modems and headsets.\n[3] Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are to some extent complementary in their applications and usage. Wi-Fi is usually access point-centered, with an asymmetrical client-server connection with all traffic routed through the access point, while Bluetooth is usually symmetrical, between two Bluetooth devices.\n[4] The choice of Bluetooth or WiFi is clear. Bluetooth is a universal standard and easy to use. But, its range is quite limited and sound quality is restricted. WiFi systems have a wider range and can offer excellent fidelity. But, different systems that use WiFi are incompatible, and setup may be difficult.\n[5] Stockbyte/Stockbyte/Getty Images. Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are both wireless networking technologies. They transmit information via radio signals broadcast through the air rather than over wires, allowing devices to communicate with each other and share information.\n[6] Bluetooth 4.0 vs. Wi-Fi Direct: Speed. Wi-Fi Direct promises device-to-device transfer speeds of up to 250Mbps, while Bluetooth 4.0 promises speeds similar to Bluetooth 3.0 of up to 25Mbps. Both Bluetooth 4.0 and Wi-Fi Direct use the 802.11 networking standard to reach their maximum speeds.\n[7] Bluetooth 4.0 vs. Wi-Fi Direct: Speed Wi-Fi Direct promises device-to-device transfer speeds of up to 250Mbps, while Bluetooth 4.0 promises speeds similar to Bluetooth 3.0 of up to 25Mbps. Both Bluetooth 4.0 and Wi-Fi Direct use the 802.11 networking standard to reach their maximum speeds.\n[8] Bluetooth vs. WiFi - Range: Maximum range for Bluetooth based wireless connections is 30m while for Wi-Fi, it can extend well upto 100m. In Wi-Fi, range depends on the version of Wi-Fi protocol applied and addition of antennas in the communication system while no such concerns of range or extra antenna are much known in Bluetooth. . Bluetooth vs. WiFi - Devices Connected: In Bluetooth, upto 7 devices can be connected to each other (piconet) while in Wi-Fi, the maximum connections depend on Wi-Fi router which can accommodate 1 to several communicating devices at a time.\n[9] Bluetooth or Wi-Fi: what's the difference? Here's the biggest difference: With Bluetooth, you stream music from your phone to a speaker. A Wi-Fi speaker accesses music from the internet, or from a computer on your home network. You can control a Wi-Fi speaker with your smartphone. You just have to stay within range of your Wi-Fi router's signal.\n[10] Wi-Fi is used for creating wireless local area networks, linking devices within about 100 meters of a central wireless access point. Bluetooth has a much smaller range and is used to create personal area networks of devices that are within about 10 meters of each other.\n[11] Bluetooth and Wi-Fi (the brand name for products using IEEE 802.11 standards) have some similar applications: setting up networks, printing, or transferring files. Wi-Fi is intended as a replacement for high speed cabling for general local area network access in work areas.\n[12] Best Answer: Radio.Bluetooth is a high-speed, low-power microwave wireless link technology, designed to connect phones, laptops, PDAs and other portable equipment together with little or no work by the user. Unlike infra-red, Bluetooth does not require line-of-sight positioning of connected units.\n[13] Bluetooth is a wireless technology developed by Ericsson that is designed to be a cable replacement. It operates on the 2.4GHz frequency band, like WiFi, and is officially known as IEEE standard 802.15.1.\n[14] Also like WiFi, Bluetooth is \"fairly\" secure. Unlike WiFi, tethering via Bluetooth isn't all that common. Sure, people do it, but it's a little more involved to set up than WiFi, and a little more involved every time you want to use Bluetooth tethering. If power consumption is a concern, Bluetooth is probably the way to go, if you're willing to configure it.\n[15] No brainer here. Wi-Fi Direct offers speeds of up to 250Mbps while Bluetooth 4.0 lags behind at a paltry-seeming 25Mbps. While I'm somewhat skeptical that it'll come close to the touted maximum speed, there's no doubt it's significantly faster than the current Bluetooth High Speed standard.\n[16] Both specifications tout security as one of their main benefits. Bluetooth 4.0 uses AES 128-bit encryption to protect your data as it is transmitted between devices. Wi-Fi Direct, on the other hand, uses WPA2 security, and its AES 256-bit encryption. The winner is clear, but it should be stated that even Bluetooth 4.0 is remarkably secure.\n[17] Bluetooth 4.0 is using AES 128-bit encryption, while Wi-Fi Direct relies on WPA2 security, which uses AES 256-bit encryption. Both forms use key-based encryption and authentication methods, and both offer enough security for the average consumer.\n[18] Bluetooth is another wireless technology you're probably familiar with. You can connect your devices--laptop, phone, printer, hands-free headsets, and smart devices (such as smart bathroom scales)--that are in close proximity to each other to transmit data and let your devices communicate without wires.\n[19] Both specifications tout security as one of their main benefits. Bluetooth 4.0 uses AES 128-bit encryption to protect your data as it is transmitted between devices. Wi-Fi Direct, on the other hand, uses WPA2 security, and its AES 256-bit encryption.\n[20] Bluetooth 4.0, on the other hand, is said to have a range of at least 200 feet and it transfers data faster than NFC. NFC and Bluetooth are both ways to wirelessly connect devices.\nSearch Query: what is wifi vs bluetooth.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

It boils and vaporises at -252.125 \u00b0C Just cooling or compressing Hydrogen won't liquefy or freeze it.\n[8] Hydrogen can exist as a liquid under high pressure and an extremely low temperature of 20.28 kelvin (\u2212252.87\u00b0C, \u2212423.17 \u00b0F). Hydrogen is often stored in this way as liquid hydrogen takes up less space than hydrogen in its normal gas form. Liquid hydrogen is also used as a rocket fuel.ydrogen is found in large amounts in giant gas planets and stars, it plays a key role in powering stars through fusion reactions. Hydrogen is one of two important elements found in water (H 2 O). Each molecule of water is made up of two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom.\n[9] At STP (standard temperature and pressure) hydrogen is a gas. It cools to a liquid at -423 \u00b0F, which is only about 37 degrees above absolute zero. Eleven degrees cooler, at \u2026 -434 \u00b0F, it starts to solidify.\n[10] Confidence votes 11.4K.

Eleven degrees cooler, at -434 \u00b0F, it starts to solidify.\n[11] 1 Liquid metallic hydrogen: Helium is a liquid at normal pressure and temperatures near absolute zero, a result of its high zero-point energy (ZPE), the lowest possible energy.\n[12] Hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless gas. Its density is the lowest of any chemical element, 0.08999 grams per liter. By comparison, a liter of air weighs 1.29 grams, 14 times as much as a liter of hydrogen. Hydrogen changes from a gas to a liquid at a temperature of -252.77\u00b0C (-422.99\u00b0F) and from a liquid to a solid at a temperature of -259.2\u00b0C (-434.6\u00b0F). It is slightly soluble in water, alcohol, and a few other common liquids.\n[13] Hydrogen gas has the molecular formula H 2. At room temperature and under standard pressure conditions, hydrogen is a gas that is tasteless, odorless and colorless. Hydrogen can exist as a liquid under high pressure and an extremely low temperature of 20.28 kelvin (\u2212252.87\u00b0C, \u2212423.17 \u00b0F). Hydrogen is often stored in this way as liquid hydrogen takes up less space than hydrogen in its normal gas form. Liquid hydrogen is also used as a rocket fuel.\n[14] As it is a gas, Hydrogen is neither shiny or dull. It can be liquified at temperatures around 14 degK (about -435 degF) Gaseous Hydrogen will conduct electricity only when ionized, as such it is classed as an insulator. Astrobuf.\n[15] What is the temperature of the gas turn to liquid? Every gas has a different liquidation temperature based on what element it is. Hydrogen has a liquidation point of 423.17 degrees below zero F.\n[16] Hydrogen's state of matter is gas at standard conditions of temperature and pressure. Hydrogen condenses into a liquid or freezes solid at extremely cold... Hydrogen's state of matter is gas at standard conditions of temperature and pressure. Hydrogen condenses into a liquid or freezes solid at extremely cold temperatures. Hydrogen's state of matter can change when the temperature changes, becoming a liquid at temperatures between minus 423.18 and minus 434.49 degrees Fahrenheit. It becomes a solid at temperatures below minus 434.49 F.Due to its high flammability, hydrogen gas is commonly used in combustion reactions, such as in rocket and automobile fuels.\n[17] Liquid hydrogen or slush hydrogen may be used, as in the Space Shuttle. However liquid hydrogen requires cryogenic storage and boils around 20.268 K (\u2212252.882 \u00b0C or \u2212423.188 \u00b0F). Hence, its liquefaction imposes a large energy loss (as energy is needed to cool it down to that temperature).\n[18] At room temperature hydrogen is a gas. It is a colorless, tasteless and odorless gas. It is the lightest gas. It is insoluble in water. It is highly inflammable and burns with blue flame forming water. Liquefication temperature of hydrogen is -252oC. Bond energy of H-H is 431 Kj/mole. Electro negativity of hydrogen is 2.1.\n[19] Answer The boiling point of liquid hydrogen is 20.268 K (-252.88 \u00b0C or -423.184 \u00b0F) The freezing point of hydrogen is 14.025 K (-259.125 \u00b0C or -434.\n[20] A further temperature decrease below the boiling point eventually results in mixtures of liquid and solid hydrogen or slush hydrogen, SLH 2. Slush offers the advantages of a higher density and a prolongation of the storage time of the cryogen as the solid melts and absorbs heat.

These factors may be biological, socioeconomic, psychosocial, behavioral, or social in nature. Scientists generally recognize five determinants of health of a population [2, 3]: 1 Genes and biology: for example, sex and age.\n[10] Social determinants of health reflect the social factors and physical conditions of the environment in which people are born, live, learn, play, work, and age. Also known as social and physical determinants of health, they impact a wide range of health, functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes. Examples of social determinants include: Availability of resources to meet daily needs, such as educational and job opportunities, living wages, or healthful foods.\n[11] The social determinants of health (SDH) are the social and economic factors that influence people's health. These are apparent in the living and working conditions that people experience every day. The SDH influence health in many positive and negative ways.he social gradient not only represents the effects of income on health but also the importance of income as a means of gaining access to other social determinants of health such as education, food, housing, recreational activities, and other societal resources.\n[12] Social determinants of health are economic and social conditions that influence the health of people and communities (1).

Some causes are always short-term (acute), and others can become long-lasting (chronic) unless successfully treated.\n[2] The most common urgent causes of pelvic pain are pelvic inflammatory disease, ruptured ovarian cyst, and appendicitis; however, many other diagnoses in the differential may mimic these conditions, and imaging is often needed.\n[3] Causes of Pelvic Pain. Acute pelvic pain is pain that starts over a short period of time anywhere from a few minutes to a few days. This type of pain is often a warning sign that something is wrong and should be evaluated promptly. Pelvic pain can be caused by an infection or inflammation. An infection doesn't have to affect the reproductive organs to cause pelvic pain. Pain caused by the bladder, bowel, or appendix can produce pain in the pelvic region; diverticulitis, irritable bowel syndrome, kidney or bladder stones, as well as muscle spasms or strains are some examples of non-reproductive causes of pelvic or lower abdominal pain.\n[4] Some of the less common causes of Pelvic pain may include: 1 Fibroids. 2 Radiculitis. 3 Lyme disease. 4 Abdominal cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome. 5 Tabes dorsalis. 6 Hepatitis.\n[5] Although pelvic pain often refers to pain in the region of women's internal reproductive organs, pelvic pain can be present in men, too, and can stem from multiple causes. Pelvic pain may be a symptom of infection or may arise from pain in the pelvic bone or in non-reproductive internal organs, such as the bladder or colon. In women, however, pelvic pain can very well be an indication that there may be a problem with one of the reproductive organs in the pelvic area (uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix, or vagina). What Causes Pelvic Pain? Possible causes of pelvic pain in both men and women may include: Appendicitis; Bladder disorders; Sexually transmitted diseases\n[6] Cause.

Female pelvic pain is typically caused by a medical condition involving the reproductive organs, urinary tract, lower gastrointestinal tract, or muscles of the abdominal wall. Some causes are always short-term (acute), and others can become long-lasting (chronic) unless successfully treated.\n[7] Some of the more common sources of acute pelvic pain, or pain that occurs very suddenly, may include: 1 ectopic pregnancy: a pregnancy that occurs outside the uterus. 2 pelvic inflammatory disease: an infection of the reproductive organs.3 twisted or ruptured ovarian cyst. 4 miscarriage or threatened miscarriage.elvic pain may have multiple causes, including: 1 inflammation or direct irritation of nerves caused by acute or chronic trauma, fibrosis, pressure or intraperitoneal inflammation. 2 muscular contractions or cramps of both smooth and skeletal muscles. 3 psychogenic factors, which can cause or aggravate pain.\n[8] This type of pain may be a warning that something is wrong. Some causes of acute pelvic pain include: An infection of your uterus, fallopian tubes, or ovaries; this condition is called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). An infection of the urethra, bladder, or kidneys.\n[9] Some of the possible common medical causes of Pelvic pain may include: 1 Pelvic abscess. 2 Ovarian cyst. 3 Ovarian cancer. 4 Endometriosis. 5 Sequelae of acute PID. 6 Chronis pancreatitis. 7 Renal calculi. 8 Inflammatory bowel disease. 9 Irritable bowel syndrome. 10 Microscopic colitis. 11 Left renal vein entrapment. 12 Muscular infection.\n[10] Pelvic pain is pain in the lowest part of your abdomen and pelvis. In women, pelvic pain may refer to symptoms arising from the reproductive or urinary systems or from musculoskeletal sources. Depending on its source, pelvic pain may be dull or sharp; it may be constant or off and on (intermittent); and it may be mild, moderate or severe. Pelvic pain can sometimes radiate to your lower back, buttocks or thighs. Pelvic pain can occur suddenly, sharply and briefly (acute) or over the long term (chronic). Chronic pelvic pain refers to any constant or intermittent pelvic pain that has been present for more than a few months. Sometimes, you may notice pelvic pain only at certain times, such as when you urinate or during sexual activity. 1 Causes.\n[11] In this article. Although pelvic pain often refers to pain in the region of women's internal reproductive organs, pelvic pain can be present in men, too, and can stem from multiple causes. Pelvic pain may be a symptom of infection or may arise from pain in the pelvic bone or in non-reproductive internal organs, such as the bladder or colon.\n[12] Pelvic pain can be a sign that there is a problem with one of the organs in your pelvic area, such as the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix or vagina. It could also be a symptom of infection, or a problem with the urinary tract, lower intestines, rectum, muscle or bone.\n[13] Other causes in women or men Examples of other possible causes of pelvic pain \u2014 in women or men \u2014 include: 1 Appendicitis. 2 Colon cancer. 3 Chronic constipation. 4 Crohn's disease. 5 Diverticulitis.\n[14] Some causes of acute pelvic pain include: 1 An infection of your uterus, fallopian tubes, or ovaries; this condition is called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). 2 An infection of the urethra, bladder, or kidneys. 3 Ovarian cysts - may go away on their own or may need to be surgically removed. Ectopic pregnancy.\n[15] Acute (or sharp) pain starts suddenly and often has a single cause. This type of pain may be a warning that something is wrong. Some causes of acute pelvic pain include: An infection of your uterus, fallopian tubes, or ovaries; this condition is called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). An infection of the urethra, bladder, or kidneys.\n[16] Pain caused by the bladder, bowel, or appendix can produce pain in the pelvic region; diverticulitis, irritable bowel syndrome, kidney or bladder stones, as well as muscle spasms or strains are some examples of non-reproductive causes of pelvic or lower abdominal pain.\n[17] Causes of Pelvic pain. Pelvic pain has numerous causes, may be mild or severe and include: pelvic inflammatory disease, ovarian cysts/polycystic ovarian syndrome, endometriosis, adenomyosis, fibroids, ectopic pregnancy, appendicitis, bladder/kidney infection, irritable bowel syndrome and diverticulitis.1 Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).elvic pain has numerous causes, may be mild or severe and include: pelvic inflammatory disease, ovarian cysts/polycystic ovarian syndrome, endometriosis, adenomyosis, fibroids, ectopic pregnancy, appendicitis, bladder/kidney infection, irritable bowel syndrome and diverticulitis. 1 Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).\n[18] Pelvic pain may be a symptom of infection or may arise from pain in the pelvic bone or in non-reproductive internal organs, such as the bladder or colon.\n[19] Pelvic pain may arise from your digestive, reproductive or urinary system. Recently, doctors have recognized that some pelvic pain, particularly chronic pelvic pain, may also arise from muscles and connective tissue (ligaments) in the structures of the pelvic floor.ther causes in women or men Examples of other possible causes of pelvic pain \u2014 in women or men \u2014 include: 1 Appendicitis. 2 Colon cancer. 3 Chronic constipation. 4 Crohn's disease. 5 Diverticulitis.\n[20] Pelvic pain may arise from your digestive, reproductive or urinary system.

Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: how are some sharks warm blooded.\n\n[1] Most sharks are cold-blooded. Some, like the Mako and the Great white shark, are partially warmblooded (they are endotherms). Cold blooded although if you've ever seen a Great White Shark hunt sea lions you'd be thinking they would have to be hotblooded. Actually the Salmon Shark is a warm blooded shark.\n[2] Most sharks are cold-blooded. Some, like the Mako and the Great white shark, are partially warmblooded (they are endotherms). These sharks can raise their temperature about the temperature of the water; they need to have occasional short bursts of speed in hunting.\n[3] Are sharks cold-blooded or warm-blooded? Sharks have a reputation as \"cold-blooded killers\" and despite how negative that term is, it's not entirely inaccurate. Sharks are by no means evil, vicious killers like that quote suggests. Nonetheless, sharks are, for the most part anyways, efficient ectothermic predators. Endo vs Ecto.\n[4] These sharks are unique in their ability to elevate and maintain body temperatures as much as 13 C above the ambient water temperature. One striking feature of these warm-bodied sharks is that their flanks and viscera are warm, while the heart and gills are at environmental temperatures.\n[5] These sharks can raise their temperature about th\u2026e temperature of the water; they need to have occasional short bursts of speed in hunting Cold blooded although if you've ever seen a Great White Shark hunt sea lions you'd be thinking they would have to be hotblooded. Actually the Salmon Shark is a warm blooded shark.\n[6] Are White Sharks warm-blooded or cold-blooded? White sharks are part of the fish family, so they must be 'cold-blooded', right? Actually, white sharks are much more complex than you may think. An animal that is 'cold-blooded' means their inside body temperature is dependent on the environment they are in. For example, a snake is cold blooded, so its body temperature fluctuates with the day or even whether or not they are in the sun.\n[7] Sharks' blood gives them turbo speed. Several species of shark and tuna have something special going on inside their bodies. For a long time, scientists have known that some fish species appear warm-blooded. Salmon sharks can elevate their body temperatures by up to 20 degrees compared to the surrounding water, for example.\n[8] More on Warm-Bodied Sharks. Shortfin Mako (Isurus oxyrinchus) A question came across SHARK-L concerning makos being considered warm-blooded and various replies touch upon aspects of the topic. I responded to the original query and went onto expand upon or correct some of those responses.\n[9] Great white sharks are some of the only warm blooded sharks. This allows them to swim in colder waters in addition to warm, tropical waters. Great White sharks can be found as\u2026 north as Alaska and as south as the southern tip of South America. They exist worldwide, everywhere in-between. 5 people found this useful.\n[10] A question came across SHARK-L concerning makos being considered warm-blooded and various replies touch upon aspects of the topic. There are currently two species of mako recognized, the Longfin (Isurus paucus) and the Shortfin (I. oxyrinchus).\n[11] White sharks are part of the fish family, so they must be 'cold-blooded', right? Actually, white sharks are much more complex than you may think. An animal that is 'cold-blooded' means their inside body temperature is dependent on the environment they are in. For example, a snake is cold blooded, so its body temperature fluctuates with the day or even whether or not they are in the sun.\n[12] White sharks have a unique system called a \"counter current heat exchange\", which keeps their body tempreture +/- 7C above the surrounding water temperature. All sharks have an incredibly unique system on the tip of their nose called the \"ampillae of Lorenzini\". These are small pores filled with a gel that transmits the electrical currents in the water to the shark's brain so that it can assess its environment.\n[13] Some fish are ectothermic such as the Blue shark whereas others are endothermic such as swordfish and Lamnid sharks.ndothermic = warm-blooded Ectothermic = cold-blooded Endotherms are able to maintain their own body temperature, whereas Ectotherms rely on their environment to regulate body \u2026 temperature.\n[14] Gruber: Mackerel sharks, including great whites, makos, threshers, and porbeagles, have a heat-conserving mechanism known as the rete mirabile (wonderful net), a structure for warming blood passing over the gills.\n[15] The Salmon Shark is one of the warmest of the warm-bodied sharks. Measurements of its epaxial (upper back) muscles indicate that this species is able to maintain a body temperature 14 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit (8 to 11 degrees Celsius) above the ambient water temperature.\n[16] But the advantages of endothermy are costly. To maintain a warm body in cold water, a mackerel shark must burn fuel like a blast furnace. A warm-bodied shark may need more than ten times as much food as a cold-bodied shark of the same size.\n[17] For many people, sharks are the epitome of the 'cold-blooded killer'. The warm-bodied mackerel sharks are spectacular reminders that many of our stereotypes are inaccurate. As apex predators, sharks are absolutely essential to the health and vigor of marine ecosystems.\n[18] Large sharks that living in temperate waters include the great white shark, the shortfin mako shark, and the basking shark. These large temperate sharks can generate their own body heat and are therefore able to travel farther than smaller temperate sharks, which cannot.lthough large temperate sharks will travel into tropical waters, they will swim only at depths where the temperature is in their preferred range. Smaller sharks are much more affected by heat and cold and stay within their limits. Sandbar sharks like water temperature between about 15\u00b0-30\u00b0C (59&deg-86&degF).\n[19] Certain lamnid sharks, tuna and billfishes are also endothermic. In common parlance, endotherms are characterized as warm-blooded .. The opposite of endothermy is ectothermy, although there is no absolute or clear separation between the nature of endotherms and ectotherms in general.\n[20] Regardless sharks are cold blooded, they live either in warm, temperate and cold waters. Some species live mainly in cold waters, while some others prefer warmer waters. SHARK MIGRATION. One thing is for sure; sharks migrate to find new sources of food and they can travel up to hundreds of miles to do that. Most species of sharks live in the oceans. However, some of them are known to dwell in bodies of freshwater, like the bull shark which travels up to 4,000 Km up the Amazon River. Sometimes, sharks reach freshwater bodies; this could be the result of the destruction of their habitat by human activities.\nSearch Query: how are some sharks warm blooded.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

The most important thing to remember is that a midpoint bisects a line (cuts a line into two equal halves). The midsegment of a trapezoid is the segment that joins the midpoints of the nonparallel sides of a trapezoid. In the trapezoid below, the midpoints of the non-parallel sides are points S and V. The midsegment is the red line segment from S to V.

The length of the midsegment is calculated by finding the average length of each of the parallel sides. The formula for this length is the sum of the length of side A plus the length of side B, divided by two. The midsegment is also used to calculate the area of a trapezoid. Learn more about Shapes.\n[5] A line segment which joins mid points of two leg of trapezoid is called midline or mid segment. Theorem: According to this theorem mid segment of a trapezoid is equal to half of sum of its two parallel sides. Proof of theorem: Proof: let P is middle point of line segment AC. In triangle ABC M is mid point of AB and P is midpoint of AC. so MP is mid segment of triangle ABC.\n[6] The midsegment (also called the median or midline) of a trapezoid is the segment that joins the midpoints of the legs. It is parallel to the bases. Its length m is equal to the average of the lengths of the bases a and b of the trapezoid, The midsegment of a trapezoid is one of the two bimedians (the other bimedian divides the trapezoid into equal areas). The height (or altitude) is the perpendicular distance between the bases.\n[7] Extended Conjecture: (Trapezoid Midsegment Conjecture): The midsegment of a trapezoid is parallel to the bases and is equal in length to the average of the lengths of the two bases. Explanation: A midsegment of a trapezoid is a segment that connects the midpoints of the two non-parallel sides of a trapezoid. This segment has two special properties. It is parallel to the bases of the trapezoid. The length of the midsegment is the average of the lengths of the two bases. Remember that the bases of a trapezoid are parallel. Key Curriculum Press can provide demo versions of Geometer's Sketch Pad.\n[8] A trapezoid midsegment connects the midpoints of the two congruent sides of the trapezoid, and is parallel to the pair of parallel sides. The length of the midsegment is the sum of the two bases divided by 2. Remember that the bases of a trapezoid are the two parallel sides. To find angles within a trapezoid, remember that since there are two sides are parallel, the other sides can be seen as transversals, forming corresponding angles and same side interior angles.\n[9] The midsegment of a trapezoid has two special properties: 1 The midsegment of a trapezoid is parallel to each base. 2 The length of the midsegment of a trapezoid is equal to half the sum of the lengths of its bases.\n[10] The midsegment (also called the median or midline) of a trapezoid is the segment that joins the midpoints of the legs. It is parallel to the bases. Its length m is equal to the average of the lengths of the bases a and b of the trapezoid,\n[11] The segment that connects the midpoints of the legs of a trapezoid is called the midsegment. This segment's length is always equal to one-half the sum of the trapezoid's bases, or. Consider trapezoid ABCD shown below.\n[12] The midsegment (also called the median or midline) of a trapezoid is the segment that joins the midpoints of the legs. It is parallel to the bases. Its length m is equal to the average of the lengths of the bases a and b of the trapezoid,n obtuse trapezoid with two pairs of parallel sides is a parallelogram. A parallelogram has central 2-fold rotational symmetry (or point reflection symmetry). There is some disagreement whether parallelograms, which have two pairs of parallel sides, should be regarded as trapezoids.\n[13] According to this theorem mid segment of a trapezoid is equal to half of sum of its two parallel sides. In triangle ABC M is mid point of AB and P is midpoint of AC. so MP is mid segment of triangle ABC. similarly just apply this rule in triangle ACD the PN is midsegment of triangle ACD.\n[14] In the trapezoid below, the midpoints of the non-parallel sides are points S and V. The midsegment is the red line segment from S to V. The midsegment below can be found by. calculating the lengths of the bases 35-16 = 9 (length of upper base) 45-0 =45 (length of lower base) calculating the sum of the bases 9+45 = 54.\n[15] This segment's length is always equal to one-half the sum of the trapezoid's bases, or. Consider trapezoid ABCD shown below. The midsegment, EF, which is shown in red, has a length of. The measurement of the midsegment is only dependent on the length of the trapezoid's bases.\n[16] In the trapezoid below, the midpoints of the non-parallel sides are points S and V. The midsegment is the red line segment from S to V. The midsegment below can be found by. 1 calculating the lengths of the bases. 35-16 = 9 (length of upper base)\n[17] The side of the triangle that the midsegment does not intersect is the base of the triangle. The midsegment of a trapezoid is the segment formed by connecting the midpoints of the two legs of a trapezoid. Although the midsegment of a trapezoid is also useful in mathematics, we will not discuss it here.\n[18] Median of a Trapezoid The median (also called a midline or midsegment) is a line segment half-way between the two bases. The median's length is the average of the two base lengths: m = a+b2\n[19] The top and bottom sides of the trapezoid run parallel to each other, so they are the trapezoid's bases. The other sides of the trapezoid will intersect if extended, so they are the trapezoid's legs. The segment that connects the midpoints of the legs of a trapezoid is called the midsegment.\n[20] Median: The median of a trapezoid is a line joining the midpoints of the two legs.

The McDouble contains gristle and carry's a different flavor than the Double Cheeseburger. The double cheeseburger tastes more like beef. The McDouble tastes of whatever meat filler they use to fill the gap.\n[2] At first glance, the double cheeseburger looks a lot like the McDouble, but it is not exactly the same thing. The main difference that you will notice is the amount of cheese that is on this sandwich. There are two slices of cheese on the double cheeseburger instead of just the one slice of cheese that comes on the McDouble. Even though it comes with two slices of cheese, it still has the onions, pickles, ketchup and mustard that come on the other burgers.\n[3] A double cheesburger has 2 slices of cheese with 2 meat patties. A mcdouble on the other hand only had 1 slice of cheese, but still 2 pieces of meat. I say had because mcdoubles arent sold in Australia (maybe a few stores but not a regular menu item) anymore. Other countries might be different but that's the difference in Australia.\n[4] The McDouble is listed as a slice of American cheese between two 100% beef patties, topped with pickles, onions, ketchup and mustard. mcdonalds.com.

The price differences between a McDonald's Cheeseburger, the beefier McDouble and the cheesier Double Cheeseburger now all fall within 50-cents of one another.\n[6] But I did it for you. With McDonald's recent release of the McDouble, they now have three basic, sub-$2 cheeseburgers: the cheeseburger, McDouble (two patties with one slice of cheese), and double cheeseburger (two patties with two slices of cheese).\n[7] The difference is that the Mighty Kid's Meal provides more food than what is typically found in a Happy Meal, providing a McDouble (a cheeseburger consisting of two patties and one slice of cheese) instead of a cheeseburger or a hamburger, and more Chicken McNuggets (6 versus 4), plus a larger drink (16oz vs 12oz).\n[8] Although we previously reported that the McDouble would be on the Dollar Menu, in Manhattan the cheeseburger appears on the Dollar Menu while the McDouble is $1.39 and the double cheeseburger is $1.49.\n[9] The Double Cheeseburger is priced at $1.49 and my Triple Cheeseburger was priced at $2.19. I just don't understand the point of paying 70-cents for an extra burger patty when you can just get two McDoubles for $2.00.

Summary: RN is a Registered Nurse, while BSN is a graduate program in nursing.\n[4] Comparing the RN and BSN: What's the Difference? Many people are unfamiliar with the different types of nursing credentials. Nurses may hold one of several types of degrees ranging from the licensed practical nurse (LPN) to a Master of Nursing (MSN) or doctorate (DNP). One of the most commonly confused comparisons is that of the Registered Nurse (RN) and the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) prepared nurse.\n[5] What Is the Difference Between RN and BSN Degrees? A registered nurse (RN) is a nurse who has passed the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX-RN) after completing an accredited training program. These programs come in the form of an Associate of Science in Nursing (ASN) or a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN).\n[6] You might be interested to know that both the ASN graducate and the BSN graduate both get the RN and have the same duties as an RN when they graduate.

Getting your BSN isn't just something you do for yourself, though. It also benefits your patients. Studies have shown that BSNs have lower patient mortality rates and lower failure to rescue rates.\n[11] Short version: All BSNs are RNs, but not all RNs are BSNs. RN is registered nurse. You can get there via a diploma program, an associates degree (ADN) program or a bachelors degree (BSN) program. A BSN RN is just an RN with a bachelor's degree--basically, they have the most schooling and it (usually) takes the longest to achieve.\n[12] An alternate path involves further education, resulting in a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree.

Speech impairments in spastic dysarthria involves four major abnormalities of voluntary movement: spasticity, weakness, limited range of motion and slowness of movement.\n[2] Sensorimotor impairments such as muscle weakness, incoordination, reduced or excessive movement, involuntary muscle activity, and altered tone occur across multiple dysarthria types, so clinicians must identify particular configurations of these abnormalities in order to differentiate among the disorders (3).\n[3] Dysarthria is a feature of many neurological diseases including cerebral palsy, stroke, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson s disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis. Dysarthria is a relatively common symptom of multiple sclerosis and can take many forms.Episodic paroxysmal dysarthria, which is where the dysarthria lasts for up to a minute or so and recurs several times a day, is particulary common in MS.ysarthria refers to speech problems that are caused by the muscles involved with speaking or the nerves controlling them. Both muscle weakness and incoordination can give rise to dysarthria. Speech problems that result from cognitive dysfunction are not dysarthria.\n[4] Some of the types of speech impairments include: 1 Dysarthria, a physical weakness or paralysis of the speech muscles caused by nerve or brain damage. 2 Dysprosody, characterized by changes in the intensity of volume, timing of words, and rhythm and intonation of words while speaking.\n[5] The types of cerebral palsy are: 1 spastic: the most common type of cerebral palsy; reflexes are exaggerated and muscle movement is stiff. 2 dyskinetic: dyskinetic cerebral palsy is divided into two categories.ther Types of Cerebral Palsy. Symptoms of other types of cerebral palsy may also include floppy muscle tone and lack of muscle coordination. Tremors or an unsteady gait are also common.\n[6] The ability to speak may be impaired as a result of physical, not intellectual, impairment. Non-spastic cerebral palsy is divided into two groups, ataxic and dyskinetic. Together they make up 20% of cerebral palsy cases.

The following factors, alone or in combination, may account for the speech delay: hearing loss, incoordination or spasticity of the muscles of the tongue, coexisting mental retardation or a defect in the cerebral cortex.\n[12] 1 Developmental verbal dyspraxia also known as childhood apraxia of speech. 2 Dysarthria is a weakness or paralysis of speech muscles caused by damage to the nerves and/or brain. 3 Dysarthria is often caused by strokes, parkinsons disease, ALS, head or neck injuries, surgical accident, or cerebral palsy.\n[13] Other Types of Cerebral Palsy. Symptoms of other types of cerebral palsy may also include floppy muscle tone and lack of muscle coordination. Tremors or an unsteady gait are also common. People who have cerebral palsy may have difficulty with speech, chewing, and swallowing, drooling and irregular breathing.\n[14] Motor disability types of CP. Spastic: Spastic cerebral palsy causes movements to be stiff or difficult to execute. In these types of cerebral palsy the muscles may not be able to relax properly. Ataxic: In Ataxic cerebral palsy, balance and coordinated movements are difficult to achieve.\n[15] Dysarthria is a motor speech disorder. It results from impaired movement of the muscles used for speech production, including the lips, tongue, vocal folds, and/or diaphragm.The type and severity of dysarthria depend on which area of the nervous system is affected.ysarthria is caused by damage to the brain.

Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: medicare's definition of mechanical ventilation.\n\n[1] Mechanical ventilation is the medical term for artificial ventilation where mechanical means is used to assist or replace spontaneous breathing.\n[2] Medical Definition of Mechanical ventilation. Mechanical ventilation: Use of a machine called a ventilator or respirator to improve the exchange of air between the lungs and the atmosphere. Last Editorial Review: 5/13/2016.\n[3] Mechanical ventilation. For the use in architecture and climate control, see Ventilation (architecture). Mechanical ventilation is the medical term for artificial ventilation where mechanical means is used to assist or replace spontaneous breathing.\n[4] Mechanical ventilation is a life support treatment. A mechanical. ventilator is a machine that helps people breathe when they are not. able to breathe enough on their own. The mechanical ventilator is. also called a ventilator, respirator, or breathing machine. Most. patients who need support from a ventilator because of a severe. illness are cared for in a hospital's intensive care unit (ICU).\n[5] Mechanical ventilation may be defined as the use of a mechanical device to provide. ventilator support for patients. There are 2 types of mechanical ventilation: positive and. negative pressure ventilation. Positive pressure ventilation delivers a positive pressure to. inflate the lungs. Expiration is passive.\n[6] What Is Mechanical Ventilation? Mechanical ventilation, in the healthcare setting or home, helps patients breathe by assisting the inhalation of oxygen into the lungs and the exhalation of carbon dioxide. Depending on the patient's condition, mechanical ventilation can help support or completely control breathing.\n[7] Mechanical ventilation is indicated when the patient's spontaneous ventilation is inadequate to maintain life. It is also indicated as prophylaxis for imminent collapse of other physiologic functions, or ineffective gas exchange in the lungs.his may involve a machine called a ventilator or the breathing may be assisted by a registered nurse, physician, physician assistant, respiratory therapist, paramedic, or other suitable person compressing a bag or set of bellows.\n[8] What Is Mechanical Ventilation? Mechanical ventilation, in the healthcare setting or home, helps patients breathe by assisting the inhalation of oxygen into the lungs and the exhalation of carbon dioxide.Depending on the patient's condition, mechanical ventilation can help support or completely control breathing.oncerns how much inspiratory or \"trigger\" effort is required from the ventilator to recognize that the patient is trying to inhale; this can refer to a ventilator setting, but can also be used to describe the ventilator's responsiveness to the patient's breathing effort. Flow of breaths.\n[9] Mechanical ventilation, applied either invasively through a tracheotomy tube or non-invasively via a mask, is increasingly used for the long-term management of many forms of severe chronic respiratory failure in the home setting [1\u20133].\n[10] Mechanical ventilation is the use of a mechanical device (machine) to inflate and deflate the lungs. Mechanical ventilation provides the force needed to deliver air to the lungs in a patient whose own ventilatory abilities are diminished or lost. Breathing requires the movement of air into and out of the lungs. This is normally accomplished by the diaphragm and chest muscles. A variety of medical conditions can impair the ability of these muscles to accomplish this task, including: muscular dystrophies.\n[11] 1. Continuous mandatory ventilation. 2. A mode of mechanical respiration in which all breaths are mandatory and are either patient or machine triggered, and machine cycled; a minimum breathing rate is set but the patient can trigger breaths at a faster pace.\n[12] Mechanical ventilation is termed invasive if it involves any instrument penetrating through the mouth (such as an endo tracheal tube) or the skin (such as a tracheostomy tube).his may involve a machine called a ventilator or the breathing may be assisted by a registered nurse, physician, physician assistant, respiratory therapist, paramedic, or other suitable person compressing a bag or set of bellows.\n[13] Mechanical ventilation is indicated when the patient's spontaneous ventilation is inadequate to maintain life. It is also indicated as prophylaxis for imminent collapse of other physiologic functions, or ineffective gas exchange in the lungs.\n[14] Mechanical ventilation, in the healthcare setting or home, helps patients breathe by assisting the inhalation of oxygen into the lungs and the exhalation of carbon dioxide. Depending on the patient's condition, mechanical ventilation can help support or completely control breathing.\n[15] Summary Mechanical ventilation, applied either invasively through a tracheotomy tube or noninvasively via a mask, is increasingly used for long-term management of many forms of severe chronic respiratory failure in the home setting.\n[16] Mechanical ventilation. Assisted ventilation could be defined as the movement of gas into and out of lungs by an external source connected directly to the patient. The external source could be the resuscitation bag, continuous distending pressure device or a mechanical ventilator.\n[17] Ventilators are medical devices that provide mechanical ventilation to assist with or replace patients' spontaneous breathing. Mechanical ventilation is often categorized based on the interface used, such as a tracheostomy tube for invasive ventilation, or a mask for non-invasive ventilation.\n[18] Mechanical ventilation is indicated when the patient's spontaneous ventilation is inadequate to sustain life. In addition, it is indicated as a measure to control ventilation in critically ill patients and as prophylaxis for impending collapse of other physiologic functions. second possible advantage of this mode of mechanical ventilation is that cycling the ventilator into the inspiratory phase maintains normal ventilatory activity and, therefore, prevents atrophy of the respiratory muscles.\n[19] Mechanical ventilation can be noninvasive, involving various types of face masks, or invasive, involving endotracheal intubation (see Airway Establishment and Control : Endotracheal tubes). Selection and use of appropriate techniques require an understanding of respiratory mechanics.\n[20] Nasotracheal intubation In medicine, mechanical ventilation is a method to mechanically assist or replace spontaneous breathing. Mechanical ventilation is typically used after an invasive intubation, a procedure wherein an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube is inserted into the airway.\nSearch Query: medicare's definition of mechanical ventilation.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: example of monotonic function.\n\n[1] Monotonic Function. Monotonic functions are the functions which maintained the order of functions value. As we all know that the variation in independent value also make the variation in functions value. A suitable example for this is monotonic functions or linear polynomials. The monotonic functions maintains the straight line in linear programming graph. This is also called the monotonic nature over the domain and real numbers. A monotonic function increases and decreases over the interval.\n[2] Montonic Function. When a function is increasing on its entire domain or decreasing on its entire domain, we say that the function is strictly monotonic, and we call it a monotonic function. For example, consider the function g(x) equals x 3: Notice the graph of g is increasing everywhere. Therefore, this is a monotonic function.\n[3] Monotonic Function. A monotonic function is a function which is either entirely nonincreasing or nondecreasing. A function is monotonic if its first derivative (which need not be continuous) does not change sign.\n[4] To solidify our understanding of what a monotonic function is, let's consider what a non-monotonic function is. A non-monotonic function is a function that is increasing and decreasing on different intervals of its domain. For example, consider our initial example f(x) equals x 2.\n[5] monotonic function. Monotonic Function. (or monotone function), a function whose increments \u0394f(x) = f(x\u2032) \u2212 f(x) do not change sign when \u0394x = x\u2032 \u2212 x > 0; that is, the increments are either always nonnegative or always nonpositive. Somewhat inaccurately, a monotonic function can be defined as a function that always varies in the same direction.\n[6] Here's the definition of the monotonic function from Wikipedia: In calculus, a function f defined on a subset of the real numbers with real values is called monotonic (also monotonically increasing, increasing or non-decreasing), if for all x and y such that x \u2264 y one has f(x) \u2264 f(y), so f preserves the order.\n[7] In mathematics, a monotonic function (or monotone function) is a function between ordered sets that preserves or reverses the given order. This concept first arose in calculus, and was later generalized to the more abstract setting of order theory. 1 Monotonicity in calculus and analysis.\n[8] I've never heard of monotonic being used for two (input) variables, but I suppose it would mean that, for each fixed value of y, u is a monotonic function of x, and for each fixed value of x, u is a monotonic function of y (and I expect they'd need to be either both monotonic increasing or both monotonic decreasing).\n[9] An important application of monotonic functions is in probability theory. If is a random variable, its cumulative distribution function is a monotonically increasing function. A function is unimodal if it is monotonically increasing up to some point (the mode) and then monotonically decreasing. When is a strictly monotonic function, then is injective on its domain, and if is the range of, then there is an inverse function on for.\n[10] Figure 1. A monotonically increasing function (it is strictly increasing on the left and right while just non-decreasing in the middle.). Figure 2. A monotonically decreasing function. In calculus, a function f defined on a subset of the real numbers with real values is called monotonic (also monotonically increasing, increasing or non-decreasing), if for all x and y such that x \u2264 y one has f (x) \u2264 f (y), so f preserves the order (see Figure 1).\n[11] The term monotonic may also be used to describe set functions which map subsets of the domain to non-decreasing values of the codomain. In particular, if is a set function from a collection of sets to an ordered set , then is said to be monotone if whenever as elements of , .\n[12] In calculus, a function defined on a subset of the real numbers with real values is called monotonic if and only if it is either entirely increasing or decreasing. It is called monotonically increasing (also increasing or nondecreasing), if for all and such that one has, so preserves the order (see Figure 1). Likewise, a function is called monotonically decreasing (also decreasing or nonincreasing) if, whenever, then, so it reverses the order (see Figure 2).\n[13] In calculus, a function defined on a subset of the real numbers with real values is called monotonic if and only if it is either entirely increasing or decreasing. It is called monotonically increasing (also increasing or nondecreasing), if for all and such that one has, so preserves the order (see Figure 1).\n[14] In calculus, a function f {\\displaystyle f} defined on a subset of the real numbers with real values is called monotonic if and only if it is either entirely increasing or decreasing.\n[15] And, a function is known as decreasing if y-value decreases when x is increases and denoted as if x 1 2 $\\Rightarrow$ f(x 1 2). A function that either increases or decreases everywhere in an Interval is called monotonic on the Interval.\n[16] Note that just monotonic transformation of a concave function isnot necessarily concave: consider, for example f (x) = x and g (z) = z 3 .Thus the concavity of a function is not ordinal, it is cardinal property.Economic ExampleSuppose production function f (x) is concave and the cost function c (x) is convex.ote that just monotonic transformation of a concave function isnot necessarily concave: consider, for example f (x) = x and g (z) = z 3 .Thus the concavity of a function is not ordinal, it is cardinal property.Economic ExampleSuppose production function f (x) is concave and the cost function c (x) is convex.\n[17] Likewise, a function is called monotonically decreasing (also decreasing or non-increasing) if, whenever x \u2264 y, then f (x) \u2265 f (y), so it reverses the order (see Figure 2). If the order \u2264 in the definition of Monotonicity is replaced by the strict order strictly increasing.\n[18] And, a function is known as decreasing if y-value decreases when x is increases and denoted as if x 1 2 $\\Rightarrow$ f(x 1 2). A function that either increases or decreases everywhere in an Interval is called monotonic on the Interval.hen the function is increasing, the graph of the function rises from left to right. On the other hand, while the function is decreasing, its graph falls from left to right. The function y = x 2 is decreasing in the interval (-$\\infty$,0) and is increasing in the interval (0, $\\infty$).\n[19] In calculus, a function defined on a subset of the real numbers with real values is called monotonic if and only if it is either entirely increasing or decreasing. It is called monotonically increasing (also increasing or nondecreasing), if for all and such that one has, so preserves the order (see Figure 1).Likewise, a function is called monotonically decreasing (also decreasing or nonincreasing) if, whenever, then, so it reverses the order (see Figure 2).If the order in the definition of monotonicity is replaced by the strict order, then one obtains a stronger requirement.A function with this property is called strictly increasing. Again, by inverting the order symbol, one finds a corresponding concept called strictly decreasing.wo facts about these functions are: 1 if is a monotonic function defined on an interval, then is differentiable almost everywhere on, i.e. the set of numbers in such that is not differentiable in has Lebesgue measure zero.\n[20] Quite similarly, a function is termed as monotonically decreasing or a decreasing function if Y axis values do decrease as the X axis values are decreasing. The nature of increasing or decreasing function is to either increase or decrease throughout the function.\nSearch Query: example of monotonic function.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

The study's authors and others cautioned, however, that the findings do not rule out combat exposure as a reason for the increase in suicides, adding that more information was needed.he study found that the suicide rate for troops who left the military before completing a four-year enlistment was nearly twice that of troops who stayed. The rate for troops who were involuntarily discharged under less-than-honorable conditions for disciplinary infractions was nearly three times higher.\n[2] Suicide surpassed war as the military's leading cause of death. War was the leading cause of death in the military nearly every year between 2004 and 2011 until suicides became the top means of dying for troops in 2012 and 2013, according to a bar chart published this week in a monthly Pentagon medical statistical analysis journal.\n[3] Of the deaths, 83 were suicides -- just less than 13%. Mental health in the military: Share your story. Those who had committed suicide generally had been deployed for fewer days in a row than other study participants; being deployed for longer than a year was actually associated with a lower risk of suicide.\n[4] Suicide surpassed war as the military's leading cause of death.

Suicide Is Now the Leading Cause of Death Amongst Active-Duty Soldiers. In 2010, for the second year in a row, more American soldiers killed themselves than died in combat. Military officials knew they had an epidemic on their hands, but they didn't know how to mitigate the hyper-complex problem.\n[7] The largest study to date of a rising suicide rate among military personnel, published Wednesday in JAMA Psychiatry, found no connection between suicide and deployment overseas in support of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.he study found that the suicide rate for troops who left the military before completing a four-year enlistment was nearly twice that of troops who stayed. The rate for troops who were involuntarily discharged under less-than-honorable conditions for disciplinary infractions was nearly three times higher.\n[8] War was the leading cause of death in the military nearly every year between 2004 and 2011 until suicides became the top means of dying for troops in 2012 and 2013, according to a bar chart published this week in a monthly Pentagon medical statistical analysis journal.\n[9] When researchers asked 72 soldiers at Fort Carson, Colo., why they tried to kill themselves, out of the 33 reasons they had to choose from, all of the soldiers included one in particular \u2014 a desire to end intense emotional distress.\n[10] View. comments. The number of suicides among America's troops, averaging nearly one a day this year, has become the second leading cause of death among the military at the fastest pace in the nation's decade of war.\n[11] Suicide rates in the military were traditionally lower than among civilians in the same age range, but in 2004 the suicide rate in the U.S. Army began to climb, surpassing the civilian rate in 2008. Substance use is involved in many of these suicides. The 2010 report of the Army Suicide Prevention Task Force found that 29 percent of active duty Army suicides from fiscal year (FY) 2005 to FY 2009 involved alcohol or drug use; and in 2009, prescription drugs were involved in almost one third of them.\n[12] The United States military veteran suicide epidemic is an ongoing phenomenon regarding a reported high rate of suicide among U.S. military veterans, in comparison to the general public.n 2012, 177 active-duty soldiers committed suicide, conversely 176 soldiers were killed in combat. In other words, more soldiers committed suicide compared to being killed in action. In 2012, the study concluded that Army had the highest number of suicides compared to any other service branch.\n[13] Meanwhile, a new Pentagon analysis released Tuesday shows that suicide rates in the military were highest among people divorced or separated \u2014 with a rate of 19 per 100,000 \u2014 24% higher than troops who are single.\n[14] Suicide is detrimental to the readiness of the Army and is a personal tragedy for all those affected. Therefore, suicide has no place in our professional force! 2. We all realize the inherent stress and burdens placed upon our soldiers, civilians and their family members.\n[15] We suggest that moral injury is likely one of the most important factors in military suicide rates. Moral injury is not PTSD. The latter is a dysfunction of brain areas that suppress fear and integrate feeling with coherent memory; symptoms include flashbacks, nightmares, dissociative episodes and hyper-vigilance. PTSD is an immediate injury of trauma.\n[16] Most suicides happen among troops who have not seen combat.. But what about post-traumatic stress disorder? The study authors looked at PTSD as a factor but found that only nine of the 83 people who committed suicide -- about 10% -- had been diagnosed with PTSD or reported experiencing symptoms of PTSD.\n[17] Combat Fatalities not the Most Common Cause of Military Deaths. Suicide was the third leading cause of Canadian military deaths after motor vehicle accidents and cancerin a newly published study of 25 years of death records.

There is an element of truth to this, but it is not as innocent as it sounds and is related more to water quality than tank size. When properly cared for, goldfish will not stop growing.\n[3] Depending on his type and his environment, goldfish have the capacity to grow anywhere from around 6 to 15 inches within a very short period of time. If they are kept in tiny aquariums or little bowls, they will still grow, but much more slowly. Those conditions are somewhat cramped for the fish and that will show in ...\n[4] In clean, uncrowded conditions in tanks or ponds, goldfish grow fast. They can grow to a few inches (1 to 4 inches) within the first year. It really depends on their genetics and living situation. It may take a year or two before they change color from brown to gold or whatever color their parents were.\n[5] 'Goldfish usually grow with their environment so if they are in a large space and are fed enough, they do sometimes just keep growing.

If you keep your goldfish in a small tank and you limit his feeding, he will grow fairly slowly and may not grow to more than 3 or 4 inches before he succumbs to poor health and dies.\n[7] Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: Goldfish do not grow to the size of their tank, that is a myth. Goldfish grow until they are at their mature size, but being in a tank too small for them to grow properly can cause stunting.

If the tank is not large enough to allow the goldfish to grow, it's growth will be stunted and this can cause the fish to become unhealthy and die.\n[11] Common Goldfish can grow over 90 centimeters and take more than 2 years to max out. I've been told that they don't stop growing, but I don't know how true that is. Fancy Goldfish can grow to about 20 centimeters ant take about 2 years to max out I hope the Goldfish aren't Fancy, Koi can get very nasty.\n[12] pond goldfish like comets, shubunkins, and wakins can grow well over 12inches. fancier varieties like ranchus,lionhead,and orandas can grow over 10 inches. other fancy varieties like ryukins,black moors, fantails, etc. can grow over 6-7 inches. The largest goldfish recorded is over 16 inches.\n[13] Myth. How big your goldfish will grow is determined by the animal's genetics, not by the size of his environment. If your goldfish doesn't have enough space to grow to his full size, he will likely die before you notice that the environment is not large enough.\n[14] A: The conditions goldfish are kept in plus their diet determine how large they will grow. I have seen goldfish grow ridiculously large in very small containers when their water was changed frequently. Goldfish will not grow if water conditions are poor. Fancy goldfish don't grow as large as Common goldfish. A good size would be around 5 inches body length for most fancy varieties, 8 inches for Comets and 12 inches for Common Goldfish. These sizes are usually only attained by pond grown fish.\n[15] A Goldfish will grow quicker if you increase its metabolism slightly. This can be done by keeping the water at summer temperatures of around 65F to 70F. Goldfish kept at this higher temp will also need added space (2 gals per inch of fish), air bubbles and a really good filtration system.\n[16] If the tank is not large enough to allow the goldfish to grow, it's growth will be stunted and this can cause the fish to become unhealthy and die. The fancy goldfish do not get as large as the common/comet/shubunkin/feeder goldfish. The more room you can give your goldfish, the faster it will grow.\n[17] Goldfish grow much more slowly than some other fish. Many species are not able to breed until they are 1 year old, and most goldfish are not considered adults until they are about 2 or 3. Fish fry gradually change color over the first year of life, and most fish will be orange or gold by the time they are 1.\n[18] How big your goldfish will grow is determined by the animal's genetics, not by the size of his environment. If your goldfish doesn't have enough space to grow to his full size, he will likely die before you notice that the environment is not large enough.\n[19] When goldfish are in a tiny bowl, they still grow, but much more slowly. It's best to provide at least one gallon of water per full grown fish. This gives goldfish room to swim and explore their home. Plan the aquarium space according to how big the fish can become, not how big he is at the time of purchase.\n[20] I read somewhere totally scientific that goldfish will grow to a size commensurate with the size of their environment. So what if I filled a swimming pool with fresh water and all the bells and whistles they need to survive: filters, feeders, temperature regulators, aerators and what not, would I end up with dog-sized goldfish?\nSearch Query: do goldfish grow.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Any type of meat\u2014such as beef, pork, lamb, game, or poultry\u2014is ideal for sous vide. It works especially well with fish and seafood, ensuring that these delicate foods are not overcooked. Almost any vegetable can also be cooked sous vide with delicious results, as can eggs and many fruits. You can even use it to make custard-style ice cream base, b\u00e9arnaise sauce, cr\u00e8me Anglaise, custards, cheese, yogurt, and even cakes.\n[2] What kind of foods can you cook sous vide? Sous vide is traditionally seen as an alternative method for cooking meats.

Eggs come in their own wrappers\u2014their shells\u2014and we can sous vide foods that set as they cook, like custard, yogurt, and chicken liver p\u00e2t\u00e9, in glass canning jars.)\n[5] To cook sous vide, first prepare your food of choice \u2014 it can be anything from a steak or a chicken breast to corn on the cob \u2014 then place it in a plastic vacuum-sealed or zipper lock bag. Attach your immersion circulator to a pot of water and set the desired time and temperature.\n[6] Beef Index Beef Pork Poultry Fish Misc. Beef is highly recommended for Sous Vide. You can produce some astonishing results with chewy and tough cuts like for instance brisket. Beef must not exceed 60 degrees c. This will result in meat that is gray, chewy and in general bland.\n[7] Sous-vide cooking involves cooking food in sealed plastic bags immersed in hot water for long periods of time. Depending on the cut, type, and thickness of the meat or the type of food in question, cooking sous-vide for several hours is not out of the ordinary. The key is managing the temperature of the water so it stays hot enough to cook the food thoroughly and evenly, and long enough to kill any food-borne pathogens that may be in the bag along with the food.\n[8] Here's a simple, no-nonsense guide to the tools you'll need and some basic foods and techniques that should be at the top of any first-time sous vide cook's list. These are the dishes that will show you results beyond anything you've ever been able to achieve through more traditional cooking methods.\n[9] Roasts: Sear briefly on a hot cast iron skillet, vacuum pack and submerge in waterbath.

It's the easiest, most consistent way to get delicious results in the kitchen, from succulent steaks to flavor-packed veggies and fork-tender salmon. To prepare food sous vide (say: sue veed), we pick our desired doneness, then set a water bath to the appropriate time-and-temperature settings.\n[11] Sous vide is a culinary technique in which vacuum-sealed food is immersed in a water bath and cooked at a very precise, consistent temperature. This cooking technique typically involves cooking food for longer periods of time at a lower temperature.\n[12] Steak is one of the most popular foods to cook for first-time sous-vide enthusiasts, and with good reason. Cooking steak in a skillet or on the grill the traditional way leaves lots of room for error and an over- or undercooked steak is a big mistake to make when there's a Prime-grade dry-aged ribeye on the line.\n[13] Cooking sous vide is easier than its fancy name might suggest.

Sous vide recipes. From the French for 'under vacuum', sous vide is a method of cooking where ingredients are sealed in an airtight bag and submerged in a water bath. This method not only ensures a constant cooking temperature, but allows the food to cook for long periods of time without losing any of its flavour or moisture.\n[17] How to Cook Using Sous Vide. Sous-vide, which is French for \"under vacuum\", also called cryovacing, is a method of cooking that is intended to maintain the integrity of ingredients by heating them for an extended period of time at relatively low temperatures. It was developed by Georges Pralus in the mid-1970s.\n[18] Sous-vide\u2014French for \"under-vacuum\"\u2014is an innovative cooking technique in which food is vacuum sealed and slow-cooked in water at constant low temperatures until it's perfectly cooked through.\n[19] sous vide means cooking under a vacuum. You vacuum bag it, and then you stick it in an Thermal Immersion Circulator to precisely control the temperature. All the juices are sealed in the bag and the food should cook perfectly.\n[20] What is sous vide?

Exons are the nucleotide sequences of genes that are expressed, and those are found at either sides of an intron. In simple terms, it could be stated that exons really hit the ground in the expression of genes or in the protein synthesis.The polypeptide strand is formed based on the nucleotide sequence in exons. Exons are found at the two ends of a gene while introns are always found inside the gene. \u2022 When mutations take place, introns sometimes contribute nucleotides but usually not the other way around. \u2022 Both DNA and RNA contain introns and exons, but mature RNA only contain exons and not the introns.\n[13] By definition, exons and introns are sequences in a protein-coding gene region of a double-stranded DNA molecule (dsDNA) that are expressed as proteins, or intervening sequences not so expressed.

Factors that can cause your heart to work harder include: High blood pressure (hypertension). This is the most common cause of left ventricular hypertrophy. More than one-third of people show evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy at the time of their diagnosis with hypertension. Aortic valve stenosis.\n[2] By Mayo Clinic Staff. Left ventricular hypertrophy can occur when some factor makes your heart work harder than normal to pump blood to your body. Factors that can cause your heart to work harder include: High blood pressure (hypertension). This is the most common cause of left ventricular hypertrophy. More than one-third of people show evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy at the time of their diagnosis with hypertension.\n[3] Left ventricular hypertrophy can develop in response to some factor \u2014 such as high blood pressure or a heart condition \u2014 that causes the left ventricle to work harder. As the workload increases, the muscle tissue in the chamber wall thickens, and sometimes the size of the chamber itself also increases.\n[4] Factors that can cause your heart to work harder include: 1 High blood pressure (hypertension). This is the most common cause of left ventricular hypertrophy. More than one-third of people show evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy at the time of their diagnosis with hypertension. Aortic valve stenosis.\n[5] Left ventricular hypertrophy may cause or facilitate many cardiac complications of hypertension, including congestive heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and sudden death. Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, which may present with all of the symptoms and signs of congestive heart failure, is common in patients with long-standing hypertension.\n[6] Left ventricular hypertrophy can occur as an inborn disease in infants and children, due to an underlying condition known as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or HCM is a hereditary disease that involves an inborn abnormality of the cardiac muscles.\n[7] Left ventricular hypertrophy is enlargement and thickening (hypertrophy) of the walls of your heart's main pumping chamber (left ventricle). Left ventricular hypertrophy can develop in response to some factor \u2014 such as high blood pressure or a heart condition \u2014 that causes the left ventricle to work harder. As the workload increases, the muscle tissue in the chamber wall thickens, and sometimes the size of the chamber itself also increases.\n[8] Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) occurs when the muscle tissue in the heart's main pumping chamber becomes enlarged. LVH is often caused by high blood pressure or other heart problems and can lead to serious complications, such as heart disease, heart attack and heart failure.\n[9] Left ventricular hypertrophy is a thickening of the wall of the heart's main pumping chamber. This thickening may result in elevation of pressure within the heart and sometimes poor pumping action. The most common cause is high blood pressure.\n[10] Several underlying conditions can contribute to or influence the enlargement of the heart muscle in the left ventricle. Hypertension is the most common cause, setting the stage for left ventricular hypertrophy once a person's blood pressure exceeds the normal level of 140/90 mm Hg. Aside from hypertension, the condition known as aortic valve stenosis is also a common cause of the hypertrophic changes in the heart.\n[11] See the Mayo Clinic webpage Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). It's the thickening of the muscle of the left ventricle, usually because pumping against a higher resistance (hypertension, aortic valve defects) or as part of a hereditary heart muscle disease (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). It's correlated with more heart failure, more heart attacks, more deaths.\n[12] Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a condition in which the muscle wall of heart's left pumping chamber (ventricle) becomes thickened (hypertrophy). Learn more about symptoms, diagnosing and treatment options from the experts at Cleveland Clinic.\n[13] Left ventricular hypertrophy is thought to be the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in the adult population. This is most commonly the result of longstanding high blood pressure which has caused secondary damage to the wall of the main pumping chamber of the heart, the left ventricle.\n[14] While ventricular hypertrophy occurs naturally as a reaction to aerobic exercise and strength training, it is most frequently referred to as a pathological reaction to cardiovascular disease, or high blood pressure. It is one aspect of ventricular remodeling. While LVH itself is not a disease, it is usually a marker for disease involving the heart.\n[15] Patients who present with a thickened left ventricle are likely suffering from left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). There are a few different causes of LVH. It is a strong indicator of potential coronary complications, and there is a strong correlation between certain types of LVH and morbidity and mortality.\n[16] Chamber Hypertrophy and Enlargment. In hypertrophy the heart muscle becomes thicker. This can have different causes. Left ventricular hypertrophy results from an increase in left ventricular workload, e.g., during hypertension or aortic valve stenosis. Right ventricular hypertrophy results from an increase in right ventricular workload, e.g., emphysema or pulmonary embolization. These causes are fundamentally different from hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HCM), which is a congenital misalignment of cardiomyocytes, resulting in hypertrophy.\n[17] The most common ventricular hypertrophy occurs on the left side, but a recent study published in the journal Circulation found that right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) is associated with an increased risk of heart failure and cardiovascular death in patients without clinically diagnosed heart disease at the start of the study.\n[18] Left ventricular hypertrophy is more common in people who have uncontrolled high blood pressure. But no matter what your blood pressure is, developing left ventricular hypertrophy puts you at higher risk for a heart attack and stroke. Treating high blood pressure can help ease your symptoms and may reverse left ventricular hypertrophy.\n[19] Heart-Healthy Living.

This medication is used as a moisturizer to treat or prevent dry, rough, scaly, itchy skin and minor skin irritations (e.g., diaper rash, skin burns from radiation therapy). Emollients are substances that soften and moisturize the skin and decrease itching and flaking. Some products (e.g., zinc oxide, white petrolatum) are used mostly to protect the skin against irritation (e.g., from wetness). Dry skin is caused by a loss of water in the upper layer of the skin.\n[3] In the case of Theraderm, this is taken even further, as the brand was founded by a plastic surgeon, Dr. James Beckman.

Tracheids are found in the xylem of all higher plants except certain angiosperms, such as cereals and sedges, in which the water-conducting function is performed by vessels, or tracheae.Tracheids are usually polygonal in cross section; their walls have annular, spiral, or scalene thickenings or rimmed pores.racheids are found in the xylem of all higher plants except certain angiosperms, such as cereals and sedges, in which the water-conducting function is performed by vessels, or tracheae. Tracheids are usually polygonal in cross section; their walls have annular, spiral, or scalene thickenings or rimmed pores.\n[3] The xylem tracheary elements consist of cells known as tracheids and vessel members, both of which are typically narrow, hollow, and elongated. Tracheids are less specialized than the vessel members and are the only type of water-conducting cells in most gymnosperms and seedless vascular plants.\n[4] Woody angiosperms have also vessels. The mature tracheids form a column of superposed, cylindrical dead cells whose end walls have been perforated, resulting in a continuous tube called vessel (trachea) . Tracheids are found in all vascular plants and are the only conducting elements in gymnosperms and ferns.Tracheids have Pits on their end walls. Pits are not nearly as efficient for water translocation as Perforation Plates found in vessel elements.oody angiosperms have also vessels. The mature tracheids form a column of superposed, cylindrical dead cells whose end walls have been perforated, resulting in a continuous tube called vessel (trachea) . Tracheids are found in all vascular plants and are the only conducting elements in gymnosperms and ferns.\n[5] 1 The xylem tracheary elements consist of cells known as tracheids and vessel members, both of which are typically narrow, hollow, and elongated. Tracheids are less specialized than the vessel members and are the only type of water-conducting cells in most gymnosperms and seedless vascular plants.\n[6] In most plants, pitted tracheids function as the primary transport cells. The other type of tracheary element, besides the tracheid, is the vessel element. Vessel elements are joined by perforations into vessels. In vessels, water travels by bulk flow, as in a pipe, rather than by diffusion through cell membranes.\n[7] Tracheid of oak shows pits along the walls. It is longer than a vessel element and has no perforation plates. Tracheids are elongated cells in the xylem of vascular plants that serve in the transport of water and mineral salts.Tracheids are one of two types of tracheary elements, vessel elements being the other. Tracheids, unlike vessel elements, do not have perforation plates.racheids provide most of the structural support in softwoods, where they are the major cell type. Because tracheids have a much higher surface to volume ratio compared to vessel elements, they serve to hold water against gravity (by adhesion) when transpiration is not occurring.\n[8] Tracheids and vessel elements form tube-shaped structures that provide pathways for water and minerals to travel from the roots to the leaves. While tracheids are found in all vascular plants, vessels are found only in angiosperms. Phloem is composed mostly of cells called sieve-tube cells and companion cells. These cells assist in the transport of sugar and nutrients produced during photosynthesis from the leaves to other parts of the plant. While tracheid cells are nonliving, sieve-tube and companion cells of the phloem are living.\n[9] Difference Between Tracheids and Vessels In plants xylem and phloem are the complex tissues which are the components parts of conductive system. In higher plants xylem contains tracheids, vessels (tracheae), xylem fibres(wood fibres) and xylem parenchyma (wood parenchyma).\n[10] While tracheids are found in all vascular plants, vessels are found only in angiosperms.

Tracheophytes are distinguished from bryophytes by their highly developed vascular systems, which facilitate the transport of water and nutrients to all parts of the plant.\n[13] Tracheids and vessel members are referred to as tracheary elements. Phloem vascular tissue contains parenchyma and has two types of cells that assist in the transport of food: sieve-tube members and sieve cells. Sieve-tube members are more specialized and are present in advanced flowering seed plants.

Vessel elements are joined by perforations into vessels. In vessels, water travels by bulk flow, as in a pipe, rather than by diffusion through cell membranes.t also allows plants to draw water from the root through the xylem to the leaf. Water is constantly lost through transpiration from the leaf. When one water molecule is lost another is pulled along by the processes of cohesion and tension.\n[15] Xylem tracheids are pointed, elongated xylem cells, the simplest of which have continuous primary cell walls and lignified secondary wall thickenings in the form of rings, hoops, or reticulate networks.\n[16] While tracheids are found in all vascular plants, vessels are found only in angiosperms. Phloem is composed mostly of cells called sieve-tube cells and companion cells. These cells assist in the transport of sugar and nutrients produced during photosynthesis from the leaves to other parts of the plant.While tracheid cells are nonliving, sieve-tube and companion cells of the phloem are living.ylem and phloem throughout the plant make up the vascular tissue system. They allow water and other nutrients to be transported throughout the plant. Xylem is consists of two types of cells known as tracheids and vessel elements.\n[17] (1) A type of vascular tissue in terrestrial plants composed of tracheary elements, tracheids and wood vessels and of additional xylem fibers, and is primarily involved in transporting water and nutrient (from the roots to the shoot and leaves) and providing structural support. (2) The primary component of wood in plants.\n[18] Vascular plants (from Latin vasculum: duct), also known as tracheophytes (from the equivalent Greek term trachea) and also higher plants, form a large group of plants that are defined as those land plants that have lignified tissues (the xylem) for conducting water and minerals throughout the plant. In vascular plants, the principal generation phase is the sporophyte, which is usually diploid with two sets of chromosomes per cell. 2 Only the germ cells and gametophytes are haploid.\n[19] a compound tissue in vascular plants that helps provide support and that conducts water and nutrients upward from the roots, consisting of tracheids, vessels, parenchyma cells, and woody fibers.\n[20] Thank you...

In the 1890s, the Salvation Army had some 45,00 officers in Britain and 10,000 worldwide.\n[10] The movement, founded in 1865 by William Booth, has spread from London, England, to many parts of the world. The rapid deployment of the first Salvationists was aided by the adoption of a quasi-military command structure in 1878 when the title, 'The Salvation Army', was brought into use. A similarly practical organisation today enables resources to be equally flexible.\n[11] In 1879, she held the first meeting of The Salvation Army in America, in Philadelphia.

The movement, founded in 1865 by William Booth, has spread from London, England, to many parts of the world.\n[15] The Salvation Army, founded by William and Catherine Booth, aimed to continue the tradition of socially committed evangelicalism which dated back to John Wesley's Methodism and American revivalism propagated by James Caughey.\n[16] Welcome to The Salvation Army in Greater Cincinnati, whose history dates back to 1865 when a dynamic Methodist minister took to London's slums to champion the poor and neglected. The organization's founder, William Booth, began a movement that outlasted his lifetime and changed the face of philanthropy.\n[17] In spite of violence and persecution, some 250,000 people were converted under the ministry of The Salvation Army between 1881 and 1885.

Recurring genital herpes in people with normal immune systems. Recurring cold sores in people with normal immune systems.\n[3] Famciclovir (Famvir) is sometimes used to treat the herpes virus that causes cold sores and genital herpes (as well as the virus that causes shingles). This medicine is available only by prescription and is taken orally in tablet form.\n[4] Famciclovir (Famvir) is a drug used for the treatment of genital herpes, cold sores, shingles, and chickenpox. Side effects, drug interactions, warnings and precautions, and pregnancy information should be reviewed prior to taking this medication.\n[5] Famciclovir is commonly prescribed to treat cold sores, genital herpes, and shingles. The antiviral medication is typically used at the first signs of an outbreak to help reduce symptoms and prevent outbreaks from occurring again. Depending on the condition being treated, the tablets can be taken every day, for just one day, or for a week.\n[6] Famvir (Famciclovir) is approved by the FDA for the treatment of cold sores. If started at the first sign of symptoms, taking a single high dose of Famvir can shorten the herpes infection by two days. Valtrex (Valacyclovir) is also approved by the FDA to treat cold sores.\n[7] Uses. Famciclovir is used to treat infections caused by certain types of viruses. It treats shingles caused by herpes zoster. It also treats outbreaks of herpes simplex that cause cold sores around the mouth, sores around the anus, and genital herpes. In people with frequent outbreaks of genital herpes, famciclovir is used to help reduce the number of future episodes. Famciclovir is an antiviral drug. However, it is not a cure for these infections. The viruses that cause these infections continue to live in the body even between outbreaks.\n[8] It slows the growth and spread of the herpes virus so that the body can fight off the infection. Famciclovir will not cure herpes, but it can lessen the symptoms of the infections. Famciclovir is used to treat infections caused by herpes viruses, including genital herpes, cold sores, and shingles. There is no cure for herpes and famciclovir will not prevent you from developing symptoms in the future. Famciclovir may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.\n[9] DRUG DESCRIPTION. The active ingredient in FAMVIR tablets is famciclovir, an orally administered prodrug of the antiviral agent penciclovir. Chemically, famciclovir is known as 2-[2-(2-amino-9H-purin-9-yl)ethyl]-1,3-propanediol diacetate. Its molecular formula is C 14 H 19 N 5 O 4; its molecular weight is 321.3.\n[10] Famciclovir is an antiviral medication used for treating shingles, genital herpes, and cold sores. This eMedTV article offers dosing information for the medication, explains how it works, describes its clinical effects for various conditions, and more.\n[11] FAMVIR tablets contain 125 mg, 250 mg, or 500 mg of famciclovir, together with the following inactive ingredients: hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, lactose, magnesium stearate, polyethylene glycols, sodium starch glycolate and titanium dioxide.\n[12] Report Abuse. It's not exactly a substitute but it's antiviral medication that is also used to help heal out breaks of herpes and viruses related to it like shingles. Also some people don't react well to acyclovir so Famvir can be used instead. LINDSEY S \u00b7 5 years ago.\n[13] Famciclovir (Famvir\u00ae) and Valacyclovir (Valtrex\u00ae) Both are new antiherpesviral prodrugs (in the same class as acyclovir).

It may be used as a reference compound. Famciclovir may be used to study the factors that control its conversion into penciclovir and other metabolites.\n[17] The Effect of Famciclovir on Cold Sores. Famvir (Famciclovir) is approved by the FDA for the treatment of cold sores. If started at the first sign of symptoms, taking a single high dose of Famvir can shorten the herpes infection by two days. Valtrex Is a Well-Known Treatment for Cold Sores.

After that, you could go right into the suppression dose, which is 250 mg twice a day.\n[19] Biochem/physiol Actions. Famciclovir is an antiretroviral guanosine analog used to treat herpesvirus infections and hepatitis B. Famciclovir is rapidly converted to penciclovir. Viral thymidine kinase phosphorylates penciclovir to a monophosphate form that celular kinases convert in turn to penciclovir triphosphate.\n[20] Acyclovir is an prescription medicine approved by the U.S. (FDA) to treat and prevent reoccurrence of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections (including genital herpes) and to treat (VZV) diseases (including chicken pox and ).\nSearch Query: what is famvir prescribed for.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age.\n[7] For other uses, see Spruce (disambiguation).

USER: I will provide you with 20 passages, each indicated by a numerical identifier []. Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: what is a active margin.\n\n[1] Best Answer: An active margin is a tectonic plate boundary, a passive margin is a compositional transition within a tectonic plate. As you probably know the theory of plate tectonics posits the outer layer of the Earth consist of plates which move relative to each other driven by convection in the Mantle.\n[2] An active plate margin is an actual plate boundary, where oceanic crust and continental crust crash into each other. Active plate margins are often the site of earthquakes and volcanoes. Oceanic crust created by seafloor spreading in the East Pacific Rise, for instance, may become part of the Ring of Fire, the horseshoe-shaped pattern of volcanoes and earthquake zones around the Pacific ocean basin.\n[3] An active continental margin refers to the submerged edge of a continent overriding an oceanic lithosphere at a convergent plate boundary by opposition with a passive continental margin which is the remaining scar at the edge of a continent following continental break-up.\n[4] \u2022 Pacific = Active Margin geologic activity 11 The ocean floor can be classified as (a) Continental Margins \u2013the submerged outer edge of a continent (b) Ocean Basin \u2013 the deep seafloor beyond the continental margin There are two types of continental Margins (a)passive or trailing margins: margin of continent that moves away from spreading center \u2013 Atlantic-style margins (also Artic Ocean, Antarctica and Indian Ocean). Very little volcanic or earthquake activity is associated with passive margins. (b) active or leading margins: plate boundary located along a continental margin \u2013 ocean trenches where there is subduction of oceanic lithosphere \u2013 narrow, steep, with volcanic mountains (West Coast of the Americas). Active margins are the site of volcanic and earthquake activity. 12 Continental Margins\n[5] An active continental margin is found on the leading edge of the continent where it is crashing into an oceanic plate. An excellent example is the west coast of South America. Active margins are commonly the sites of tectonic activity: earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain building, and the formation of new igneous rock.\n[6] rating newest oldest best answer an active continental margin is found on the leading edge of the continent where it is crashing into an oceanic plate an excellent example is the west coast of south americaactive margins are commonly the sites of tectonic activity earthquakes volcanoes mountain building and the formation of new igneous rockn excellent example is the west coast of south america active margins are commonly the sites of tectonic activity earthquakes volcanoes mountain building and the formation of new igneous rock\n[7] best answer an active continental margin is found on the leading edge of the continent where it is crashing into an oceanic platean excellent example is the west coast of south americaactive margins are commonly the sites of tectonic activity earthquakes volcanoes mountain building and the formation of new igneous rockn excellent example is the west coast of south america active margins are commonly the sites of tectonic activity earthquakes volcanoes mountain building and the formation of new igneous rock\n[8] The overall rate may be extremely slow (one to ten centimeters per year), but the long term effect is a continual re-shaping of the surface of our planet. An active continental margin is found on the leading edge of the continent where it is crashing into an oceanic plate. An excellent example is the west coast of South America. Active margins are commonly the sites of tectonic activity: earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain building, and the formation of new igneous rock.\n[9] Passive margin. A passive margin is the transition between oceanic and continental lithosphere that is not an active plate margin. A passive margin forms by sedimentation above an ancient rift, now marked by transitional lithosphere. Continental rifting creates new ocean basins.\n[10] Making the world better, one answer at a time. Passive continental margins are not areas of convergence. There is little volcanic and earthquake activity on passive margins. Active margins are areas of convergence where one plate is descending beneath another. They are associated with volcanic and earthquake activity.\n[11] Two types of continental margins exist: active margins and passive margins. Active margins form primarily along the boundaries of plates that are actively converging. Passive margins currently exist in the middle of plates, not at plate boundaries.\n[12] Active and Passive Continental Margins [Part 2] - Duration: 15:15. worldethq 4,279 views\n[13] Active continental margins form primarily along the boundaries of plates that are actively converging and where one plate is sinking beneath the other. Active margins mark the continents that border the Pacific Ocean where oceanic plates are subducting beneath continental plates.assive continental margin: A continental margin that has a broad continental shelf, a gentle continental slope, and a pronounced continental rise; it is marked by a lack of earthquake and volcanic activity. Plates: Large sections of Earth's lithosphere separated by deep fault zones.\n[14] Active Margins. occur where oceanic lithosphere is being subducted beneath the edge of the continent. the result is a relatively narrow margin that consists of highly deformed sediment that was scraped from the decending lithospheric slab and plastered against the margin of the overriding continent.\n[15] Both passive and active continental margins are located near coastlines. The main difference is that active margins are the main sites where tectonic activity takes place (lik \u2026 e earthquakes). This is because the continental shelf of active continental margins collide with an oceanic plate, creating subduction.\n[16] Cases of continental margins that are on or very close to a plate margin. Most continental margins around the Pacific are active. Key characteristics of active continental margins include the activity of volcanoes and earthquakes, narrow continental shelves, large coastal mountains, and much more.\n[17] 2 types of Continental Margins: Active continental margin and Passive continental margin \u2022Active Continental Margin \u2013occur along plate boundaries (where plates are actively moving) \u2013This is where mountain building takes place!! \u2013Ex.) Nazca Plate (oceanic crust) subducting beneath South American Plate (causing mountains to form, earthquake and volcanic activity. (Andes Mountains) \u2022Passive Continental Margin \u2013do not occur along plate boundaries \u2013These are stable margins and accumulate large amounts\n[18] The continental margins along India and Antarctica are other examples of passive margins. A continental margin that has a very narrow, or even nonexistent, continental shelf and a narrow and steep continental slope is known as an active continental margin. Instead of ending in a continental rise, the continental slope of this type of margin often plunges into a deep-ocean trench, which may be filled with sediment.\n[19] A continental margin that has a broad continental shelf, a gentle continental slope, and a pronounced continental rise is known as a passive continental margin. This type of margin experiences little, if any, volcanic or earthquake activity. The build-up of sediment is the primary activity affecting a passive margin.\n[20] 1 A Continental Margin is a boundary between continental crust and oceanic crust. 2 Active continental margins occur along plate boundaries, while passive continental margins occur at the boundary that marks a continent and the oceanic crust. 3 Mountain building takes place along active continental margins only.\nSearch Query: what is a active margin.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

USER: I will provide you with 20 passages, each indicated by a numerical identifier []. Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: what can contour plowing reduce.\n\n[1] A: Contour plowing conserves soil by following the lay of the land and creating ridges that form a water break to prevent soil erosion. Furrows that do not follow the lay of the land cause rapid runoff during rainfall by forming a convenient channel for the water to flow downhill.\n[2] In contour plowing, the land is plowed across the slopes and along the contour lines. This will also reduce soil erosion and make rainwater infiltrate into the soil more than on land plowed along the slope. Terraces are more effective than contour plowing alone in minimizing soil erosion and facilitating infiltration f rainfall into the soil.\n[3] Contour plowing was a method of plowing furrows that follow the curves of the land rather than straight up and down slopes. Furrows that run up and down a slope form a channel that can quickly carry away seeds and topsoil. Contour plowing forms ridges, slows the water flow and helps save precious topsoil. LeRoy Hoffman rented farmland for his entire farming career and remembers when the government urged farmers to change their plowing methods.\n[4] Contour plowing is the act of farming on a hill or a contoured area. The plow follows the contours of the land horizontally helping to reduce runoff of water. This practice helps to prevent soil erosion in hilly and contoured areas by capturing the water runoff using water breaks to keep water contained. Contour plowing is also known as contour farming, and is a sustainable form of agriculture.\n[5] Contour plowing is also promoted in countries with similar rainfall patterns to the United States such as western Canada and Australia. The practice is effective only on slopes with between 2% and 10% gradient and when rainfall does not exceed a certain amount within a certain period.\n[6] Contour plowing. Contour ploughing or contour farming is the farming practice of ploughing and/or planting across a slope following its elevation contour lines. These contour lines create a water break which reduces the formation of rills and gullies during times of heavy water run-off; which is a major cause of top soil loss and soil erosion.\n[7] Contour plowing Contour ploughing or contour farming is the farming practice of ploughing and/or planting across a slope following its elevation contour lines. These contour lines create a water break which reduces the formation of rills and gullies during times of heavy water run-off; which is a major cause of top soil loss and soil erosion.\n[8] 2016-09-28T08:13:26-04:00. Farmers can reduce soil erosion by contour plowing. The correct option among all the options that are given in the question is the second option or option B. The other choices given in the question are incorrect and can be neglected. I hope that this is the answer that has actually come to your desired help.\n[9] Contour plowing. Contour plowing or contour farming or Contour bunding is the farming practice of plowing and/or planting across a slope following its elevation contour lines. These contour lines create a water break which reduces the formation of rills and gullies during times of heavy water run-off; which is a major cause of soil erosion.\n[10] One of the earliest methods of conservation tillage came to be known as contour plowing, or plowing on the contour. Tilling the soil along the gentle slopes of a piece of cropland, instead of up and down the gradient, prevents fertile topsoil from being carried downhill by flowing rainwater.\n[11] Contour bunding, Catalonia, 2007. Contour plowing (or contour ploughing) or contour farming is the farming practice of plowing across a slope following its elevation contour lines. The rows form slow water run-off during rainstorms to prevent soil erosion and allow the water time to settle into the soil.\n[12] In contour ploughing, the ruts made by the plow run perpendicular rather than parallel to slopes, generally resulting in furrows that curve around the land and are level. This method is also known for preventing tillage erosion. Tillage erosion is the soil movement and erosion by tilling a given plot of land. A similar practice is contour bunding where stones are placed around the contours of slopes.\n[13] However, when the compacted layer is tilled with a moldboard or chisel plow, the resulting rough, cloddy surface can decrease runoff and erosion. While it sounds contradictory, both effects are possible, depending on the soil and soil conditions encountered.\n[14] Crop rotation, strip farming, terracing and contour plowing became tools for better land and water resource management. Develop practices sustainable management of soils with the use of green roofs, paths, contour plowing and incorporation of natural barriers and minimum tillage. Sustainable management of natural resources Soil, water and biodiversity (Manejo sustentable de los recursos naturales Suelo, agua y biodiversidad ) This may include a good system of farmer extension services, better nutrient management, contour plowing, improved seed varieties or simple irrigation.\n[15] Definition of contour plowing in US English - plowing along the contours of the land in order to minimize soil erosion. Definition of contour plowing in US English - plowing along the contours of the land in order to minimize soil erosion.\n[16] Persistent herbicides present in this concentrated zone may affect shallow-planted susceptible crops. If a potential herbicide carryover problem exists and soil erosion is not a concern, moldboard plowing, in particular, can help dilute the pesticide.\n[17] Definitions for Contour plowing. Contour plowing. Contour ploughing or contour farming is the farming practice of ploughing and/or planting across a slope following its elevation contour lines.\n[18] Best Answer: The benefits of plowing are primarily weed control, turning under crop residues so that it breaks down faster, and preparing a good clean area for planting seed. These same benefits of the plow have been shown over the years to have a negative effect on the soil environment. The plow is quickly becoming an implement of the past.\n[19] Both contour plowing and terrace farming are suitable for cultivating lands on sloping hills. Both are used to reduce soil erosion from tilled fields on slopes. In terrace farming, physical barriers (trenches, stone bunds, live hedges, or natural strips) are created along the contours to retain rain water and make it infiltrate into the soil and to minimize soil erosion.\n[20] Safeopedia explains Contour Plowing. Contour farming is done in hilly and sloped areas. Farmers who practice contour farming start by cutting levels into the hill or contoured area. This creates a series of steps on the hill on which crops are grown.\nSearch Query: what can contour plowing reduce.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.
