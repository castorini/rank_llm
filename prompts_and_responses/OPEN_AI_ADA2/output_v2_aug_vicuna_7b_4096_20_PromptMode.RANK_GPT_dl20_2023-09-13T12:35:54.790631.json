Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: why do hunters pattern their shotguns?.\n\n[1] Why do hunters pattern their shotguns? to decide what animal to hunt to select ammunition with the best performance to compete against other hunters to identify the best shooting position to use in the field\n[2] Why do hunters pattern their shotguns? 1. Understanding the Importance of Cartridge and Choke Performance. There's no difference between zeroing the rifle and patterning the shotgun. The process is both easy and beneficial. When hunting, it's important to adopt humane methods to capture the animal.\n[3] You now know what patterning a shotgun means, but why do hunters pattern their shotguns in the first place? When you shoot a shotgun while hunting, you want to make sure that you are familiarized with how it works, don't you?\n[4] This is called \"patterning your shotgun.\" All shotgun hunters need to pattern their firearms to determine which brands of shells, shot sizes, and loads perform best and at what range. A shotgun may have a good pattern (high density of hits), but shoot off target. If this is the case, you will need to have the stock adjusted by a gunsmith. \u2190 Previous\n[5] You will also need to learn how to use the particular gun you have, particularly the shotgun. Do you know about patterning the shotgun? If you do, you probably wonder about why do hunters pattern their shotguns. While it does seem like a tedious task at first, it reaps a ton of benefits hunters love, which is what makes it an important thing to do.\n[6] That's the reason why many hunters opt to test their shotguns and pattern it before intense hunting sessions. You wouldn't want to go in without knowing your gun well enough. Not only does this lessen the number of clean kills you can make, but it may also hurt something in the process due to inaccurate shooting.\n[7] Shotgun Choke and Shot Pattern. 1 Cylinder choke is an unconstricted barrel. The shot pattern spreads quickly. 2 Improved Cylinder choke has a slight constriction. It allows the shot pattern to spread fairly quickly. This is a good choice for quail, rabbits, and other upland game. 3 Modified choke has moderate constriction.\n[8] There is a tendency for the six-fold to be used with larger shot in hunting and field loads. Also, the smaller shells in the 28-gauge and the .410-bore use a six-fold crimp, and though it seems counter-intuitive, the large shells of a 10-gauge also use a six-fold crimp.ne purpose of the crimp is to seal the end of the shell to prevent the shot from falling out and keep dirt from entering. The crimp also keeps the powder and shot properly packed for that micro-second when the primer ignites the powder and pressure begins to build.\n[9] The shot pellets from a shotgun spread upon leaving the barrel, and the power of the burning charge is divided among the pellets, which means that the energy of any one ball of shot is fairly low. In a hunting context, this makes shotguns useful primarily for hunting birds and other small game. backpacker shotgun has a short barrel and either a full-size stock or pistol grip, depending on legislation in intended markets. The overall length of these weapons is frequently less than 90 cm (35 in), with some measuring up at less than 63 cm (25 in).\n[10] Mossberg ships these shotguns with a wood dowel in the magazine tube to limit the shotgun to 3 shots..... The reason is many areas require that a shotgun for hunting can not hold more than 3 cartridges... 1 in the chamber and 2 in the magazine tube...\n[11] The problem is worsened by the fact that it is perfectly safe to shoot slugs through the same shotgun barrel you use for hunting quail or ducks, and a lot of deer slug hunters do just that, rather than spend the money to get a real slug barrel with rifle sights to put on their shotguns.\n[12] Shotgun choke is the constriction at the muzzle end of the gun that tightens the pattern of pellets. In an average cartridge there are approximately 300 pellets, so how wide the shot pattern or how restricted is a matter than will make all the difference to your shooting.\n[13] Many skilled shotgun shooters have a tendency to shoot slugs the same way they shoot shotshells\u2013they just point and slap the trigger. That works fine if you're throwing out a cloud of pellets that can cover a 30-inch target circle by the time they're 30 yards from the muzzle.\n[14] Most patterns are designed to make the hunt \u2013 BOTTOMLAND went right ahead and built a camo company. Bottomland is Mossy Oak's original camo pattern, created by Toxey Haas two decades ago. This pattern preserves the original design while applying advanced technology for increased effectiveness.\n[15] Devoted to the use of muzzleloading shotguns for hunting, Trap, Skeet and other shooting sports. For most shooters, the phrase muzzle loader is synonymous with a muzzle loading rifle. However, there are a surprising number of shooters who, at least occasionally, shoot a muzzle loading shotgun.\n[16] Firearm hunters and bowhunters have a responsibility to make quick kills and recover. all game. One complaint that members of the public (other hunters and non-. hunters) have about hunters is \"slow deaths, wounded and unrecovered animals.\". Accurate shot placement is the key to a quick kill and game recovery. Necessary. ingredients of good shot placement are knowledge of how a hunting arm harvests game,\n[17] Mossberg ships these shotguns with a wood dowel in the magazine tube to limit the shotgun to 3 shots..... The reason is many areas require that a shotgun for hunting can not hold more than 3 cartridges... 1 in the chamber and 2 in the magazine tube... This keeps the gun legal no matter where Mossberg ships them....\n[18] These removable tubes control the dispersion of the shot fired from the shotgun. Changing the dispersion of the shot is useful if the same gun will be used in multiple sports, such as trap and skeet, or used in hunting different species of game, according to the website gunnersden.com.ylinder choke indicates no choke effect and is the most open choke, providing the widest dispersion of shot as it exits the barrel. Extra full is the tightest choke and concentrates the shot into the tightest pattern.\n[19] Shotgun chokes, whether they be screw-in choke tubes or fixed-chokes (permanent part of the barrel) are used to control the diameter and density of the pellet pattern at a spe \u2026 cific distance.\n[20] Cylinder choke is an unconstricted barrel. The shot pattern spreads quickly. Improved Cylinder choke has a slight constriction. It allows the shot pattern to spread fairly quickly. This is a good choice for quail, rabbits, and other upland game. Modified choke has moderate constriction. The shot stays together longer, making the pattern denser and more useful at longer ranges. This choke is used often for dove hunting and is the preferred choke when using steel shot to hunt for ducks or geese.\nSearch Query: why do hunters pattern their shotguns?.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Along with his family, Tsar Nicholas II was shot by firing squad in the year of 1918, in a house in Ekaterinburg. The Romanovs' bodies were buried near the location of t \u2026 heir death but have since been exhumed and venerated in the Peter-and-Paul Cathedral in St. Petersburg, Russia as martyred saints.\n[10] Nicholas II's handling of Bloody Sunday and World War I incensed his subjects and led to his abdication. Bolsheviks executed him and his family on the night of July 16-17, 1918, in Yekaterinburg, Russia. Early Life. Nicholas II was born Nikolai Aleksandrovich Romanov in Pushkin, Russia, on May 6, 1868. He was his parents' firstborn child. Nicholas II's father, Alexander Alexandrovich, was heir to the Russian empire. Nicholas II's mother, Maria Feodorovna, had been born in Denmark.\n[11] It's a difficult case.. The report's final evidence was published online last week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Bolsheviks killed Czar Nicholas II, Empress Alexandra and their five children in 1918 as Russia plunged into bitter civil war.\n[12] In the early morning hours of July 17, 1918, Czar Nicholas II\u2014the last monarch of the Romanov dynasty, which ruled Russia for 304 years\u2014was reportedly executed along with his wife, Alexandra, and their five children by their Bolshevik captors in the basement of a house in Yekaterinburg.\n[13] The Russian Imperial Romanov family (Tsar Nicholas II, his wife Tsarina Alexandra and their five children Olga, Tatiana, Maria, Anastasia, and Alexei) and all those who chose to accompany them into imprisonment \u2013 notably Eugene Botkin, Anna Demidova, Alexei Trupp and Ivan Kharitonov \u2013 were shot, bayoneted and clubbed to death in Yekaterinburg on the night of 16-17 July 1918.\n[14] Nicholas II was the last Tsar of Russia born on 6/18 May 1868, shot by Bolsheviks with the rest of his family and some loyal staff on July 17 1918 His autocratic tendencies \u2026helped bring down the Romanov Dynasty and Imperial Russia, He was forced to abdicate the throne on March 2/15 1917.\n[15] Nicholas II, 1914 \u00a9 Nicholas II was the last tsar of Russia.

In the same year, Nicholas married Princess Alexandra of Hesse-Darmstadt (a duchy in Germany).\n[19] In 1881, Nicholas' father, Alexander III, became czar (emperor) of Russia after his father, Alexander II, was killed by an assassin's bomb. Nicholas, at twelve, witnessed his grandfather's death when the czar, horribly maimed, was carried back to the palace.\n[20] In Yekaterinburg, Russia, Czar Nicholas II and his family are executed by the Bolsheviks, bringing an end to the three-century-old Romanov dynasty.

Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: what amino produces carnitine.\n\n[1] But before I get into the details of this flawed study, let's first take a closer look at carnitine and what it does in your body. The Transporter. L-carnitine, or just carnitine (the L refers to the configuration of the carnitine molecule that is biologically active) is often referred to as an amino acid, but it is not a true amino acid. Carnitine is an amino acid-like compound that is made in the body from the amino acids lysine and methionine. Its name is derived from the Greek word for flesh or meat, carnus. Not so coincidentally, it's abundant in red meat and dairy products, but it can also be found in various nuts, grains, and green vegetables.\n[2] Acetyl L Carnitine is one of the more common formulations of L-Carnitine, which is itself an amino acid that is produced from two other amino acids (Lysine and Methionine). This version, or form, of L-Carnitine is significant more active than it parent compound due to a higher degree of bioavailability.\n[3] L-carnitine is synthesized in the body from the amino acids lysine and methionine. Learn how your chances of success can increase with this in your arsenal. L-carnitine is synthesized in the body from the amino acids lysine and methionine.Regardless of what your bodybuilding and fitness goals are, losing fat or gaining muscle, your chances of success will increase greatly if you have l-carnitine in your supplement arsenal.-carnitine is synthesized in the body from the amino acids lysine and methionine. Learn how your chances of success can increase with this in your arsenal. L-carnitine is synthesized in the body from the amino acids lysine and methionine.\n[4] L-Carnitine is an amino acid composite \u2013 one of the building blocks of protein. It is known to increase the number of androgen receptors in muscles. These receptors allow muscle to utilize testosterone resulting in an enhanced ability to build muscle.\n[5] Carnitine biosynthesis and metabolism. Carnitine, a branched non-essential amino acid, is synthesized from the essential amino acids lysine and methionine. Ascorbic acid, ferrous iron, pyroxidine and niacin are also necessary cofactors (1) and deficiencies of any of these can lead to carnitine deficiency.\n[6] Background. Carnitine is a naturally occurring hydrophilic amino acid derivative, produced endogenously in the kidneys and liver and derived from meat and dairy products in the diet.It plays an essential role in the transfer of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation.arnitine deficiency is a metabolic state in which carnitine concentrations in plasma and tissues are less than the levels required for normal function of the organism. Biologic effects of low carnitine levels may not be clinically significant until they reach less than 10-20% of normal.\n[7] The acetyl form of this amino acid possesses many of the same abilities as the regular l-carnitine variety but in a less significant way. While the acetyl form is known for its impact on cognitive abilities, the regular l-carnitine is primarily praised for its effects on metabolism and energy production.\n[8] While it is often categorized as an amino acid, L-carnitine isn't technically an amino. It is considered a vitamin-like and amino acid-like compound that is related to the B vitamins. When it was first studied back in the 1950s, L-carnitine was referred to as vitamin BT. L-carnitine is formed in the liver and kidneys from the amino acids lysine and methionine. However, it is stored elsewhere in the body, primarily in muscle (including the heart), the brain, and even in sperm. In the diet, it mainly comes from meat and other animal products.\n[9] Carnitine, derived from an amino acid, is found in nearly all cells of the body. Its name is derived from the Latin carnus or flesh, as the compound was isolated from meat. Carnitine is the generic term for a number of compounds that include L-carnitine, acetyl-L-carnitine, and propionyl-L-carnitine [1-2].\n[10] Carnitine, derived from an amino acid, is found in nearly all cells of the body. Its name is derived from the Latin carnus or flesh, as the compound was isolated from meat.Carnitine is the generic term for a number of compounds that include L-carnitine, acetyl-L-carnitine, and propionyl-L-carnitine [ 1-2 ].arnitine plays a critical role in energy production. It transports long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria so they can be oxidized (burned) to produce energy. It also transports the toxic compounds generated out of this cellular organelle to prevent their accumulation.\n[11] Carnitine, derived from an amino acid, is found in nearly all cells of the body. Its name is derived from the Latin carnus or flesh, as the compound was isolated from meat. Carnitine is the generic term for a number of compounds that include L-carnitine, acetyl-L-carnitine, and propionyl-L-carnitine [1-2]. Carnitine plays a critical role in energy production.\n[12] L-carnitine and acetyl-L-carnitine are two different forms of the same amino acid, but acetyl-L-carnitine has been processed so it's able to pass the blood-brain barrier. Both are commonly supplemented in the diet, but they each boast unique benefits to health.\n[13] L-carnosine is naturally produced by the body. It is a dipeptide of the amino acids histidine and beta-alanine. L-carnosine is concentrated in areas which require a lot of energy, such as the muscles, brain, liver, kidneys, and heart. This amino acid has a number of antioxidant properties. Consequently it has been the subject of a lot of research.\n[14] It is found in heart, skeletal muscle and other tissues where fatty acid oxidation occurs. Carnitine is needed to transport any fatty acids of greater than 8-10-carbon chain length into the mitochondria for oxidation to carbon dioxide and water with the production of energy. Since during heavy exercise fat is a primary fuel, this is taken to enhance fat utilization and sparing of glycogen stores. E. Glutamine. Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in the body, and constitutes more than 60 percent of the free intracellular amino acids in skeletal muscle.\n[15] L-Lysine is one of 9 essential amino acids that cannot be made in the body. It is the basic raw material for carnitine synthesis. L-Proline can be made in the body but low protein/vegetarian diets may not promote optimal l-proline production.\n[16] Carnitine actually comes in four forms: D-carnitine, DL-carnitine, L-carnitine and Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC). Only the last two could be of actual use to bodybuilders. When there is enough Thiamin (Vitamin B1) and pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) in circulation, it can trigger methionine and lysine to manufacture carnitine.\n[17] Category - Amino Acids - Free Form. Carnosine. SUPER CARNOSINE is a multifunctional dipeptide composed of the amino acids, chemical combination of the amino acids alanine and histidine. Found in high concentrations in body tissues including, skeletal muscles, heart muscles, nerve tissue and in the brain.\n[18] In young bodies this amino acid is found in high concentrations to support high energy-demanding tissues. As the body ages l-carnosine concentrations decline for a couple of reasons. Firstly, the body makes less of this amino acids. Secondly, l-carnosine becomes more susceptible to destruction in older bodies.\n[19] In this case, carnitine substitution (food supplementation) is certainly worthwhile. Carnitine is a biocarrier (transport substance), which is synthesised in the liver \u2013 and its precursor in the kidneys \u2013 from the two essential amino acids lysine and methionine.\n[20] CarnoSyn\u00ae beta-alanine is a non-essential amino acid that binds to histidine to form muscle carnosine.* Carnosine buffers, or neutralizes, the hydronium ions that lead to muscle fatigue and failure.*.\nSearch Query: what amino produces carnitine.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Large airways are held open by semiflexible, fibrous connective tissue called cartilage. Smaller airways are supported by the lung tissue that surrounds and is attached to them.The walls of the smaller airways have a thin, circular layer of smooth muscle.

The lungs' tertiary bronchi are also called the segmental bronchi.\n[7] The epithelium starts as a simple ciliated columnar epithelium and changes to simple ciliated cuboidal epithelium as the bronchioles decreases in size. The diameter of the bronchioles is often said to be less than 1 mm, though this value can actually range from 5 mm to 0.3 mm. As stated, these bronchioles do not have hyaline cartilage to maintain their patency. Instead, they rely on elastic fibers attached to the surrounding lung tissue for support.\n[8] In particular, one should be familiar with the four basic tissue types, most especially epithelium and connective tissue and with the basic tools of histology. Overview of Respiratory Tract Histology. The lung is one of several organs that packs a large epithelial surface area into a compact volume.he squamous epithelial cells of the alveolar walls are sometimes called Type I pneumocytes. As noted above, these squamous Type I cells facilitate gas exchange. Scattered among the squamous cells are occasional larger cuboidal cells, sometimes called greater alveolar cells and sometimes called Type II pneumocytes.\n[9] The supporting lamina propria underneath the epithelium contains elastin, that plays a role in the elastic recoil of the trachea during inspiration and expiration, together with blood vessels that warm the air. The sub-mucosa contains glands which are mixed sero-mucous glands.he epithelium is either columnar or cuboidal. The final branches of the bronchioles are called terminal bronchioles. These have a layer smooth muscle surrounding their lumens. Stimulation of the vagus nerve (parasympathetic) causes the smooth muscle to contract, and reduce the diameter of the terminal bronchioles.\n[10] The histological structure of the epithelium and the underlying connective tissue of the bronchi corresponds largely to that of the trachea and the main bronchi.

Epithelium and underlying lamina propria are called the mucosa.\n[13] The epithelium of the terminal bronchioles is composed of three types of cells-ciliated cells, nonciliated cells and a few basal cells.The epithelium of the respiratory bronchioles has three cell populations.The first near the terminal bronchioles consists of the nonciliated columnar, ciliated columnar and basal cells. The second consists of nonciliated cuboidal cells. The third is most similar to the alveolar epithelial lining.These are nonciliated cells, cuboidal type II cells, and squamous type I cells.he epithelium of the respiratory bronchioles has three cell populations. The first near the terminal bronchioles consists of the nonciliated columnar, ciliated columnar and basal cells.

The epithelium starts as a simple ciliated columnar epithelium and changes to simple ciliated cuboidal epithelium as the bronchioles decreases in size.\n[15] Of the four tissue types inside the bodies of humans, the epithelial tissue is the most prolific. The other tissue types include connective tissue, muscle tissue and nervous tissue. Ciliated columnar epithelial cells line the tracheal, bronchial and the pulmonary systems in humans.\n[16] In particular, one should be familiar with the four basic tissue types, most especially epithelium and connective tissue and with the basic tools of histology. Overview of Respiratory Tract Histology. The lung is one of several organs that packs a large epithelial surface area into a compact volume.

The average bride in the U.S. spends $1,000-$2,000 on her wedding dress. To me, spending that much on a dress you only wear once is just plain crazy. When I was able to get my dream dress for only $400 (on sale from $700), I was ecstatic.\n[19] Most wedding dresses need some adjustment, and unless your wedding gown does not have a train, at the bare minimum it will need bustles sewn in the back. So be prepared for add a bit more onto your wedding gown costs than the price tag states. The average a bride spends between $75 and $250 on alterations. If you know the wedding dress alterations you will need, feel free to call around and get some telephone bids. You do not necessarily have to use the alterations service from your bridal shop, but do not cut corners that you might regret.\n[20] It really depends on the dress and where you're located. All vendors in different areas charge different rates. In the DC area to alter a simple gown will be average $500 ... if the gown is more complex, then the alterations are more expensive.est Answer: How big is this dress? For a wedding dress that needs bustling and hemming, I'd say 100-200 is average. For a simple gown, I'd say $30-50. It depends on multiple things.

Hip replacement devices break into a few big categories: Metal on Metal (MOM) \u2013 These are what they sound like. Both the socket and the ball are made of stainless steel, titanium, chromium, cobalt or some combination of these.\n[2] Metal and Plastic Implants. A prosthetic made of metal and plastic are the most commonly used hip replacement implants. Both the ball and the socket of the hip joint are replaced with a metal implant, and a plastic spacer is placed in between. The most commonly used metals used include titanium and stainless steel.\n[3] A prosthetic made of metal and plastic are the most commonly used hip replacement implants. Both the ball and the socket of the hip joint are replaced with a metal implant, and a plastic spacer is placed in between. The most commonly used metals used include titanium and stainless steel.\n[4] The same materials are used for hip implants\u2014the stem portions of most hip implants are made of metal alloys, the ball portions are made from metal alloys or polished ceramic, and the acetabular sockets are made from metal, polyethylene (plastic), a combination of polyethylene backed by metal, or ceramic.\n[5] Ceramic Implants. Ceramic hip replacement implants also use metal parts that fit within the bone, but the bearing surface (the ball and the socket) can be made of the ceramic material. Ceramic hip implants are designed to be the most resistant to wear of all available hip replacement implants.\n[6] Implants may be made of a variety of materials including metal (usually titanium), ceramic or polyethylene (a type of hard plastic). Ongoing research and enabling technology will determine new directions in materials used in hip replacement surgery.\n[7] All hip resurfacing operations use a metal-on-metal bearing hip. Most total hip replacements are not metal-on-metal bearings and use other materials including ceramic and high density polyethylene. Your hospital will always have a record of your operation and what implants were used.\n[8] As a result, some of these implants have been recalled. Implants may be made of a variety of materials including metal (usually titanium), ceramic or polyethylene (a type of hard plastic). Ongoing research and enabling technology will determine new directions in materials used in hip replacement surgery.\n[9] In metal-on-metal devices both the ball and socket components are made of metal. These metal implants have been used in total hip replacement surgeries and hip resurfacing procedures. Because of metal's durability, metal-on-metal devices were expected to last longer than other hip implants.\n[10] The implant for a total hip replacement is composed of 3 parts: the stem, the ball, and the socket. The stem is made out of metal, usually cobalt-chrome or titanium, and is placed within the native thighbone. The ball is usually made out of polished metal or ceramic, and fits on top of the stem.\n[11] Metal-on-metal hip replacement Q & A. Answers provided by John Skinner, consultant orthopaedic surgeon at Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, Stanmore, UK, and Alister Hart, professor of orthopaedic surgery at UCL and Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, London, UK.\n[12] Dr. Tsao describes the materials used as part of a hip replacement and which material is best for each patient. Dr. Tsao is a member of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons and cares for patients at Banner Boswell Medical Center in Sun City, Arizona. Hip replacements are made of many different materials.\n[13] Update: Metal on Metal Hip Litigation. In the early 2000s, several hip implant manufactures, including DePuy , Stryker, Wright, Biomet, and Zimmer, rushed to the market with a new option for those needing hip replacement surgery.\n[14] Dr. Tsao describes the materials used as part of a hip replacement and which material is best for each patient. Dr. Tsao is a member of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons and cares for patients at Banner Boswell Medical Center in Sun City, Arizona. Dr. Tsao: Hip replacements are made of many different materials.\n[15] Hip replacements are among the most common orthopedic procedures. When a hip replacement is performed, the arthritic, damaged hip joint is removed. The ball-and-socket hip joint is then replaced with an artificial implant. Hare are brief descriptions of some of the most commonly used hip replacement implants. Not all implants are options for all patients. A prosthetic made of metal and plastic are the most commonly used hip replacement implants. Both the ball and the socket of the hip joint are replaced with a metal implant, and a plastic spacer is placed in between. The most commonly used metals used include titanium and stainless steel.\n[16] 1 metal-on-metal hip resurfacing implants \u2013 where the socket and ball of the hip bone has a metal surface applied to it rather than being totally replaced. 2 Total metal-on-metal implants where the replacement ball is less than 36mm wide.\n[17] The most common is Ti-6 aluminum Ti-4 vanadium (Ti6Al4V), but other more modern alloys are coming into use. Because of the lower moduli of elasticity than cobalt-based alloys or surgical stainless steel, titanium-based alloys have not been found to be as reliable a material when used as a cemented hip replacement.\n[18] Hip Replacement Implant Materials. There are a large number of hip implant devices on the market. These category names reference the materials used for the implant bearings. The stem and ball fit into and articulate against the cup or acetabulum. Each component can be made of one of several materials. There is no consensus in the orthopedic community regarding the single \"best\" bearing or material.\n[19] Other panels may include one or more additional metals, such as cadmium, copper, or zinc. For hip replacement monitoring, the panel includes chromium and cobalt. A doctor will select which metals to test for based upon what a person may have been exposed to in addition to clinical symptoms. The term heavy metals is loosely defined.\n[20] Titanium is a component of joint replacement parts, including hip ball and sockets. These may last for 20 years or so. Titanium is used in dental implants because it is able to osseointegrate (an unusual ability by which titanium fuses with bone tissue, perhaps through the titanium oxide layer on tianium metal).\nSearch Query: what metal are hip replacements made of.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

The first one invented was a marine chronometer, and it was created out of the necessity to have an accurate timekeeper for sea travel. John Harrison, a British clockmaker, invented this device in 1737.\n[2] The term chronometer was coined by Jeremy Thacker of Beverley, England in 1714, referring to his invention of a clock ensconced in a vacuum chamber. The term chronometer is also used to describe a marine chronometer used for celestial navigation and determination of longitude. The marine chronometer was invented by John Harrison in 1730. This was the first of a series of chronometers that enabled accurate marine navigation. From then on, an accurate chronometer was essential to deep sea marine or air navigation out of sight of land.\n[3] The invention of the chronometer was a fundamental building block for modern times. But the marine chronometer was then redesigned by John Arnold. He based his design on Harrison's clock, but he simplified it enough to produce accurate marine chronometers in large quantities during the late 1700s.\n[4] The term chronometer is also used to describe a marine chronometer used for celestial navigation and determination of longitude.

We recommend a property size of one acre or more. The economics of a wind system are determined by the average wind speed in the area, the availability of rebates or tax credits, and the cost of electricity.\n[7] Installation and maintenance costs for your personal wind turbine will vary greatly depending on local zoning, permitting and utility interconnection. Learn more about incentives and rebates offered in your area to help best calculate overall cost. The price of the turbine itself will also vary depending on tower height and type of installation requirements for your site. While costs do vary, a Skystream installed on a 45 ft (13 m) tower ranges from $17 - $20K.\n[8] A Skystream 3.7 (the wind turbine that has been recommended to me and the one I have researched most thoroughly) costs about $8,500 to purchase, install, and set up in my area. Installation costs in other areas are higher, ranging up to $12,000.\n[9] 1 For example, the equipment cost for a 10 kW wind turbine costs roughly $40,000, while a 100-kW turbine can cost more than $350,000.2 According to Bergey.com, the average wind turbine can cost $48,000 to $65,000 to install. 3 The equipment costs alone will be around $40,000. Maintenance checks are important every few years and will typically cost around $200 to $400 per year depending upon turbine size. 2 A well-maintained wind turbine should last over 20 years, but you might need to replace the inverter at a particular stage during this time, at a cost of $2,000 to $4,000 for a large system.\n[10] Home or Farm Scale Wind Turbines. Wind turbines under 100 kilowatts cost roughly $3,000 to $8,000 per kilowatt of capacity. A 10 kilowatt machine (the size needed to power a large home) might have an installed cost of $50,000-$80,000 (or more).otal costs for installing a commercial-scale wind turbine will vary significantly depending on the number of turbines ordered, cost of financing, when the turbine purchase agreement was executed, construction contracts, the location of the project, and other factors.\n[11] for example the equipment cost for a 10 kw wind turbine costs roughly $ 40000 while a 100 kw turbine can cost more than $ 350000 according to bergey com the average wind turbine can cost $ 48000 to $ 65000 to install\n[12] A 10 kW wind turbine costs approximately $48,000 \u2013 65,000 to install.

Herodotus (c. 450 B.C.) reports, as a theory of their origin, that the Etruscans came from Asia Minor.\n[16] Scholars think that the Etruscans were a seafaring people from Asia Minor. As early as 1000 BC they were living in Italy in an area that was roughly equivalent to modern Tuscany, from the Tiber River north almost to the Arno River. Later their rule embraced a large part of western Italy, including Rome.\n[17] The Etruscans are the civilization that inhabited this area before the Romans basically wiped them out.

The larger, pointed, football shaped Magana with its dark, salmon colored flesh, and the smaller, round, Pantin, or Key West with its flesh colored a brighter salmon, and a bit sweeter flavor.\n[11] To tell if your mamey is mature, gently scratch the surface of the fruit with your nail near both ends of the fruit. If the color of the flesh is an orange-red at both ends, then the fruit has matured on the tree and will ripen on your counter.\n[12] Pantin Mamey Sapote. Pouteria sapota.

Laying eggs does take a lot out of them. So my advice would be to give your birds at least a 3 month break per year. If you're purchasing these quail as pets only and don't want any eggs, follow this procedure also.\n[3] Like chickens, button quail can lay one egg a day every day, for almost her entire life. Without special attention, this practice can very quickly deplete the female of her bone calcium and other essential nutrients, leading to a very early death.\n[4] Incubation for button quail takes roughly 16 days, although we have had reports of a little slower hatch of up to 18 days. We suspect that is due to the varied temperatures and movement during transportation, or perhaps due to the variance in incubator temperatures, humidity, and elevation changes.\n[5] Provide a small water dish filled with marbles for the chicks to prevent drowning. Button Quail eggs hatch after twelve to thirteen days and the chicks are able to fly after two weeks. Choose extra small gauge weld mesh, as the chicks are tiny and can jump through the holes in the wire.Seven millimetres is ideal.uails nest on the ground and lay six to twelve eggs. They sit on them for thirteen days and if the amount of eggs is too large for the hen, the cock will join her on the nest. Chicks are tiny, but are able to feed themselves straight away.\n[6] A good hatch depends on how well you know your incubator. For the first 14 days the button quail eggs should be turned (better described as being rotated from one side to the other) at least twice a day. Three or four times a day is better. If you have an automatic turner in your incubator, it will handle that for you.\n[7] Provide a small water dish filled with marbles for the chicks to prevent drowning. Button Quail eggs hatch after twelve to thirteen days and the chicks are able to fly after two weeks. Choose extra small gauge weld mesh, as the chicks are tiny and can jump through the holes in the wire. Seven millimetres is ideal.\n[8] Best Answer: It depends on what type of quail you have. I own button quail, and a button quail usually lives 21/2 years to 4 years. It's a little less for a female. It depends on how many eggs the female has laid and how adequate her nutrition is. The longest living button quail I've heard of is 9 years, but that is pretty rare.\n[9] Others are button quail african quail and bobwhite quail which are also good layers..they lays btn one and two eggs a day. On average each quail can lay 300 eggs per year meaning each quail wouldn't lay egg on each day. However, wild quails of which some farmers are supplied by comen will rarely lay eggs.\n[10] The nesting season of Common buttonquail is June to September. The nest is a slight pad of grass placed in a natural hollow in the ground where it is usually tucked away amongst the stems of a tuft of grass. Very occasionally the grass is bent over it in a sort of canopy. Sounds of Common Buttonquail The female Common Buttonquail calls with a deep hoom-hoom-hoom and the male replies in kek-kek-kek. Population of Common Buttonquail The population size of Common Buttonquail has not been quantified. But it is not believed to approach the thresholds for vulnerable under the population size criterion. The global population size of Common buttonquail has not been quantified, but the species is reported to be scarce to locally abundant.\n[11] Here's my limited experience: Bobwhite quail hatched on 5/13/09. One egg was laid on 9/16/09. No other eggs to date. I have 5 males and 7 females housed together in a 3X5 rais \u2026 ed pen. The pen is outdoors in Georgia. I had read that egg laying begins at 5-6 months, but one of mine obviously laid at 4 months. quail which is breed to lay eggs should receive 14 hours of light per day. This may mean that artificial lightning may be needed. If the quail receives the right amount of l \u2026 ight, they will approx. lay 1 egg per day. On average they will lay 200-300 eggs per year.\n[12] Button quail are easy to raise and can produce a lot of eggs, with the right food and environment. They're very cute little birds and many are purchased as pets to keep in the home. The Button Quail can be found in many different colors, there actually are more than 15.\n[13] This species of quail has a short life span compared to other species, however, its ability to have two or three broods in a year helps their numbers. The average clutch size is 12 eggs, taking about three weeks to hatch.\n[14] Quick Answer. Bobwhite quails lay an average of 12 eggs per clutch, though they can lay as many as 20; they only lay one egg a day. They lay a large number of eggs because they often lose their nests. It takes nearly a month for the quail to hatch.\n[15] They can lay an egg a day until 2 years (then an egg every other day)...then there are those that are 5 years that lay 1 a week and get older and retire Personal experience.Breeder of Jumbo Coturnix and standard in many varieties, Chinese Blue Breasted (button quail) Quail, other game birds, poultry, waterfowl.hey can lay an egg a day until 2 years (then an egg every other day)...then there are those that are 5 years that lay 1 a week and get older and retire Personal experience.\n[16] Here's my limited experience: Bobwhite quail hatched on 5/13/09. One egg was laid on 9/16/09. No other eggs to date. I have 5 males and 7 females housed together in a 3X5 raised pen.ens start to lay around 6 months depending on the breed. Different breeds start at different times. All breeds will start laying before they are 1 year old. Move them into a \u2026 big pin with nesting boxes (so they can get used to them) when they are 5 months old.\n[17] From September until April, quail flock together in coveys. In spring, mating rituals begin, and in April, May and June, the birds build nests and lay their eggs. An average clutch is 10 to 16 eggs, although some species may lay up to 28 small, speckled eggs. The eggs hatch in 21 to 23 days. If the first nest is unsuccessful, California quail will make a second attempt during the summer.\n[18] Coturnix quail do not go broody so you will need to offer the necessary conditions to hatch the eggs. A hen will begin laying eggs between 6 to 8 weeks of age. They lay approximately an egg a day, depending on external conditions and the lines themselves. The total incubation time for the eggs is 17 days.\n[19] October 12, 2009. Quail lay eggs early and often. These tiny birds begin laying while barely little more than chicks themselves, and can lay up to 300 eggs annually. In the United States, the coturnix quail is the most common type raised domestically. This breed is also known as the Japanese quail, the Bible quail and the Nile quail.\n[20] Look inside this cardboard brooder box to see a variety of young (1 week old) Button Quail.

Bones cannot move without muscles. Most muscles (like those in our arms and legs) work in pairs \u2013 one muscle contracts as the other one relaxes. The bone is pulled towards the contracted muscle. Muscles are attached to bone by tendons. How are bones joined together? The place where two or more bones meet is called a joint.\n[9] The skeletal bones are held together by ligaments. Tendons attach your muscles to the bones of your skeleton. The muscular and skeletal systems work together to carry out bodily movement, and together they are called the musculoskeletal system.

The shape of the skeletal system also impacts movement.\n[10] Muscles, tendons, ligaments and joints all work together to produce movement due to the fact that they are all attached. As the muscles, tendons, and ligaments expand and cont \u2026 ract they pull the bones of the joint allowing the joint to move. Muscles work in groups, working in opposition one with the other In the arm, groups of muscles work by contracting and relaxing to produce gross and fine movement, \u2026 depending upon the task that the person wishes to carry out.\n[11] Yes. They work together, with the muscles contracting and pulling on tendons attached to bones, therefore pulling or pushing the bones to create movement. They control movement of the body together The muscular system and the skeletal system work together to provide support and movement for the body. Your muscles are connected to your bones by a material called cartilage. Cartilage is an extremely strong material that is impossible to tear.\n[12] Muscles, tendons, ligaments and joints all work together to produce movement due to the fact that they are all attached. As the muscles, tendons, and ligaments expand and cont \u2026 ract they pull the bones of the joint allowing the joint to move.ell first of all the bones are connected to muscles with tendons and the muscles move bones by working in pairs. The muscle pairs pull each other to move the bones. One muscl \u2026 e contracts while the other muscle relaxes, to move the bone again the other muscle contracts and the other one relaxes.\n[13] Your bones and muscles work together through a series of impulses and signals communicated between the brain and skeletal muscles. In order to move, the nervous system signals a skeletal muscle to contract. When the muscle contracts, this movement causes the attached bone (or bones) to follow.\n[14] With a lot of help. You need muscles to pull on bones so that you can move. Along with muscles and joints, bones are responsible for you being able to move. Your muscles are attached to bones. When muscles contract, the bones to which they are attached act as levers and cause various body parts to move.You also need joints which provide flexible connections between these bones.Your body has different kinds of joints.our muscles are attached to bones. When muscles contract, the bones to which they are attached act as levers and cause various body parts to move. You also need joints which provide flexible connections between these bones.

The muscles in the body provide the means of all movements. When stimulated by a nerve, the muscle contracts to become shorter and thicker and thus it pulls the bone at the movable end.ovements of bones occur only at the joints. The movements are brought about by contractions of skeletal muscles inserted onto the articulating bones by firm cords of white fibrous tissue called tendons.\n[17] How both interact: The skeletal system is covered with muscles that enable us to move. These muscles are attached to the bones through tendons and often stretch from one end of the bone to the other. Your bones and muscles work together through a series of impulses and signals communicated between the brain and skeletal muscles. In order to move, the nervous system then sends signals a skeletal muscle to contract. When the muscle contracts, this movement causes the attached bone to follow.\n[18] Vertebrates move by the actions of muscles on bones. Tendons attach many skeletal muscles across joints, allowing muscle contraction to move the bones across the joint. Muscles generally work in pairs to produce movement: when one muscle flexes (or contracts) the other relaxes, a process known as antagonism.he arms and legs are part of the appendicular skeleton. The upper bones of the limbs are single: humerus (arm) and femur (leg). Below a joint (elbow or knee), both limbs have a pair of bones (radius and ulna in the arms; tibia and fibula in legs) that connect to another joint (wrist or ankle).\n[19] Your bones and muscles work together through a series of impulses and signals communicated between the brain and skeletal muscles.

Like grain chaff this is used as animal feed, and is a way of turning coarse fodder into a form more palatable to livestock.he process of loosening the chaff from the grain so as to remove it is called threshing \u2013 traditionally done by milling or pounding. Separating remaining loose chaff from the grain is called winnowing \u2013 traditionally done by repeatedly tossing the grain up into a light wind which gradually blows the lighter chaff away.\n[6] The nature of chaff is different enough from wheat to render it worthy of fire. If you plant a little of the stem or stalk of the wheat plant, it will not grow. If you tried to sell it, you might get a few pennies, but not anything like that of the grain itself.\n[7] This straw is ordinarily saved and fed as roughage to the animals.

Carvedilol is used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. It is also used after a heart attack to improve the chance of survival if your heart is not pumping well. Lowering high blood pressure helps prevent strokes, heart attacks, and kidney problems.\n[2] Carvedilol is used to treat heart failure and hypertension (high blood pressure). It is also used after a heart attack that has caused your heart not to pump as well. Carvedilol may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.\n[3] Carvedilol tablets are indicated for the treatment of mild-to-severe chronic heart failure of ischemic or cardiomyopathic origin, usually in addition to diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and digitalis, to increase survival and, also, to reduce the risk of hospitalization [see Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].\n[4] Carvedilol is used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. It is also used after a heart attack to improve the chance of survival if your heart is not pumping well. Lowering high blood pressure helps prevent strokes, heart attacks, and kidney problems.\n[5] PRESCRIBED FOR: Carvedilol is used alone or with a diuretic (water-pill) to control high blood pressure (hypertension). Carvedilol also may be used in combination with other drugs to manage mild or moderate congestive heart failure. It is also used for treating people who develop heart failure after a heart attack.\n[6] Carvedilol is a beta-blocker. Beta-blockers affect the heart and circulation (blood flow through arteries and veins). Carvedilol is used to treat heart failure and hypertension (high blood pressure). It is also used after a heart attack that has caused your heart not to pump as well. Carvedilol may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.\n[7] Carvedilol is used to treat heart failure (condition in which the heart cannot pump enough blood to all parts of the body) and high blood pressure. It also is used to treat people who have had a heart attack. Carvedilol is often used in combination with other medications. Carvedilol is in a class of medications called beta-blockers. High blood pressure is a common condition and when not treated, can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys and other parts of the body.\n[8] Carvedilol is a type of beta-blocker that is used to treat high blood pressure, prevent a condition known as congestive heart failure from getting worse, and is used in people that have had a heart attack to treat a condition called left ventricular dysfunction.\n[9] Carvedilol is used very often for specific cases of congestive heart failure, high blood pressure, and treatment after a heart attack. Carvedilol is a beta blocker used to treat, but not cure, congestive heart failure. Beta blockers lessen the work that the heart has to do and, by doing so, help maintain a regular heartbeat. In this way, carvedilol helps to lessen the progression and symptoms of congestive heart failure.\n[10] Carvedilol is usually used to help lower blood pressure in people with hypertension, or as an additional treatment for people with heart failure. As a result of the way it works, reducing the heart rate and blood pressure, carvedilol is a good option for people with high blood pressure to reduce the load on the heart.\n[11] Carvedilol is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension), chest pain (angina) and as an additional drug for chronic heart failure, in which the heart is unable to properly pump blood around the body. It is a type of beta-adrenergic blocking agent, sometimes known as beta-blockers. It is also an alpha-blocker.\n[12] Carvedilol is a beta-blocker that's used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. Heart failure prevents the heart from pumping an adequate amount of blood to all parts of the body.\n[13] Carvedilol is in a group of drugs called beta-blockers. Beta-blockers affect the heart and circulation (blood flow through arteries and veins). Carvedilol is used to treat heart failure and hypertension (high blood pressure). It is also used after a heart attack that has caused your heart not to pump as well. Carvedilol may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.\n[14] Carvedilol is used for: Treating high blood pressure or certain types of heart failure. It may also be used after a heart attack to improve survival in certain patients. It may be used along with other medicines. It may also be used for other conditions as determined by your doctor. Carvedilol is an alpha- and beta-blocker. It works by relaxing the blood vessels, slowing down the heart, and decreasing the amount of blood it pumps out. This decreases blood pressure, helps the heart pump more efficiently, and reduces the workload on the heart. you are allergic to any ingredient in carvedilol.\n[15] Carvedilol is used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. It is also used after a heart attack to improve the chance of survival if your heart is not pumping well.\n[16] Carvedilol is also used to prevent further worsening of congestive heart failure. It is also used to treat left ventricular dysfunction after a heart attack. Left ventricular dysfunction occurs when the left ventricle (the main pumping chamber of the heart) stiffens and enlarges and can cause the lungs to fill with blood.\n[17] carvedilol is a beta blocker that s used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure heart failure prevents the heart from pumping an adequate amount of blood to all parts of the bodyarvedilol is designed to relax the blood vessels and slow the heart rate so that your blood flow improves and your blood pressure goes down approved by the food and drug administration fda in 1995 carvedilol is sold under the brand names coreg and coreg cr\n[18] Heart Failure. 1 Carvedilol tablets are indicated for the treatment of mild-to-severe chronic heart failure of ischemic or cardiomyopathic origin, usually in addition to diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and digitalis, to increase survival and, also, to reduce the risk of hospitalization [see Drug Interactions (7.4) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].\n[19] Carvedilol is in a group of drugs called beta-blockers. Beta-blockers affect the heart and circulation (blood flow through arteries and veins). Carvedilol is used to treat heart failure and hypertension (high blood pressure). It is also used after a heart attack that has caused your heart not to pump as well.\n[20] Carvedilol is indicated for the treatment of heart failure in patients with clinically stable NYHA functional class II or III heart failure. Patients taking diuretics, digitalis or ACE inhibitors should be taking stable dosages of these medications before carvedilol therapy is initiated.Carvedilol may also be used in patients unable to tolerate an ACE inhibitor and in those not taking digoxin, hydralazine (Apresoline) or nitrate therapy.arvedilol (Coreg) is the first beta blocker labeled in the United States specifically for the treatment of mild to moderate (NYHA class II or III) heart failure of ischemic or cardiomyopathic origin.\nSearch Query: what carvedilol used for.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: what does it mean if your tsh is low.\n\n[1] But the doctor may have said -- or may have meant -- your TSH is low -- which is indicative of hyperthyroidism. Remember, a low TSH is indicative of hyperthyroidism -- an overactive thyroid -- and a high TSH is indicative of hypothyroidism -- an underactive thyroid.\n[2] 1 A high TSH level means that your thyroid gland is underactive. When your thyroid gland is underactive and not producing enough thyroid hormone, your body produces more TSH to stimulate the gland and increase its activity. A low TSH level means that your thyroid gland is overactive.\n[3] If TSH is high, it typically means that your thyroid function is too low (hypothyroid). If TSH is low, then it generally means the thyroid is overactive (hyperthyroid.) Your doctor may also check levels of other thyroid hormones in your blood.\n[4] A high level of TSH and a low level of T4 in the blood could mean you have an underactive thyroid. If your test results show raised TSH but normal T4, you may be at risk of developing an underactive thyroid in the future.\n[5] What do low TSH levels mean? According to About.com, low levels of TSH, or thyroid-stimulating hormone, occur when the pituitary gland shuts down TSH production due to high levels of thyroid hormone in the blood. The low levels of TSH are the pituitary gland's attempt to keep thyroid hormone levels normal within the body. What are some symptoms associated with high TSH levels? According to WebMD, high TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) levels indicate an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism). Common symptoms include feeling weak, tired or depressed, sensitivity to cold, constipation, brittle nails, memory problems, and heavy or irregular periods.\n[6] What does a Low TSH Mean? Your thyroid gland is producing too much of the thyroid hormone which signals to your brain to stop producing anymore. Individuals who suffer from low TSH levels and high levels of T3 and T4 (the thyroid hormones) have a condition that is commonly referred to as hyperthyroidism.\n[7] If your blood test shows low TSH levels, you may have a common condition called hyperthyroidism, which is when your thyroid gland produces too much T3 and T4. Low levels of T3 and/or T4, however, can indicate a condition called hypothyroidism.t secretes thyroid hormones T3 and T4. These hormones help regulate your metabolism. The pituitary gland, located at the base of your brain, produces thyroid-stimulating hormones (TSH) that tell your thyroid gland to produce T3 and T4.\n[8] However, if an individual suffers from low TSH levels AND low levels of thyroid hormones, then it could mean that the pituitary gland (which is responsible for producing thyroid) is weak from disease or damaged.\n[9] It means that as you give someone thyroid hormone (especially T4) their pituitary gland will sense the thyroid hormone and drop the TSH in accordance. But your other tissues may NOT get the thyroid hormone. This results in patients who have a normal or low TSH but still have symptoms of hypothyroidism.\n[10] Low TSH Levels: What They Can Mean. Low TSH can indicate that there's an abundance of thyroid hormone being produced by the thyroid gland, so the pituitary gland sees no need to release TSH.\n[11] If you have too much thyroid hormone, your TSH will be low or absent. Even slight changes in TSH level could signify a serious health risk. The problem is that most patients and many physicians may not be aware that a change in thyroid prescription may change the TSH and pose serious health risks.\n[12] 1 Low TSH-Low TSH levels can be a sign that you are dealing with an overactive thyroid gland from conditions such as goiter, noncancerous tumors or Graves's disease. 2 The thyroid may also become overactive during the first trimester of pregnancy.\n[13] Conversely, a low TSH reflects either a low need or desire for thyroid hormone or a low tolerance for the thyroid hormone and is meant to reduce thyroid hormone production. An optimal value of TSH means the thyroid hormone levels match the body's energy needs and/or ability to utilize the energy.\n[14] There are 2 reasons that could be the cause behind your low TSH: 1 Your glands simply aren't producing enough; 2 Your thyroid gland is producing too much of the thyroid hormone which signals to your brain to stop producing anymore.\n[15] If you are NOT taking thyroid medication and you have a low TSH then that truly might be a sign that you are hyperthyroid or have a condition known as subclinical hyperthyroidism. But this same concept doesn't necessarily hold true if you are taking thyroid hormone (although it may). \u200b.\n[16] \u200bA low TSH, assuming you aren't taking medication, is a sign that you may be hyperthyroid. But that's not what I want to focus on here. Instead I want to spend time explaining what happens to your TSH when you are taking thyroid hormone.\n[17] Most providers would have you believe that a low TSH in the presence of taking thyroid medication is \u200ba sign of hyperthyroidism. This would indicate that you need to LOWER your dose of thyroid medication to achieve a euthyroid status in the body.\n[18] There are 2 reasons that could be the cause behind your low TSH: 1 Your glands simply aren't producing enough; Your thyroid gland is producing too much of the thyroid hormone which signals to your brain to stop producing anymore.\n[19] This drop in TSH is an attempt to return circulating thyroid hormone levels to normal. So, a test to measure the amount of TSH in your system will usually show lower than normal TSH when the thyroid is overactive. So, in general, LOWER TSH = OVERACTIVE THYROID / HYPERTHYROIDISM.\n[20] however if your tsh falls within the reference range and you have thyroid signs and symptoms a family history of thyroid disease low levels of the key thyroid hormones t4 t3 or antibodies your thyroid may not be normal\nSearch Query: what does it mean if your tsh is low.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Caffeine, on the other hand, is found in many plants, e.g., coffee, guarana, different types of tea, etc. It is a natural stimulant and does not, in fact, relieve pain. So, in effect, it is fairly opposite to opiates.\n[2] No, opiates and opioids are derived from poppies, and are narcotic pain relievers and exist in a class of depressants. Caffeine, on the other hand, is found in many plants, e. \u2026 g., coffee, guarana, different types of tea, etc. It is a natural stimulant and does not, in fact, relieve pain.\n[3] Part II. Caffeine. Caffeine, one of a class of chemicals known as the xanthines, is still prescribed occasionally by physicians. Xanthines (caffeine, theobromine, theophylline) can in varying degrees cause central nervous system stimulation and cardiac stimulation; they also act as mild diuretics.Combined with other drugs, caffeine is sometimes used for headache, particularly migraine, and in some pain remedies (for example, A-P-C capsules). Tobacco was discovered on Columbus's first voyage. Cocaine was found in large areas of South America. Caffeine and LSD-like drugs were found scattered all over the world. During the next two centuries, the Europeans not only adopted nicotine and caffeine but spread them everywhere.\n[4] Certain pain relievers contain caffeine, as the compound has been shown to increase drug effectiveness and help the body absorb the pain relieving drug more quickly. In humans, caffeine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant, having the effect of temporarily warding off drowsiness and restoring alertness.\n[5] Caffeine has been added to medications that contain aspirin, acetominophen and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) at least since the '60s, but it wasn't until the '80s that it was proven to be an adjuvant analgesic itself, meaning it assists in the pain-relieving process of the main active drug.\n[6] Since caffeine is an antagonist for the adenosine receptors, it tends to speed up nervous system activity in a dose-related manner. As a natural consequence of blocking the adenosine receptors, it can also influence the effects of other major neurotransmitters including acetylcholine, serotonin, and norepinephrine.\n[7] Therefore, narcotics are drugs that induce sleep. Specifically, that means the opiates such as heroin, morphine and related drugs. This is the correct meaning, so you should accept no other. Cocaine and meth are not narcotics.They are stimulants, the exact opposite of a narcotic. They cause people to be more awake and more active, not sleepy. Calling them :narcotics makes as much sense as calling coffee a narcotic.ocaine and meth are not narcotics. They are stimulants, the exact opposite of a narcotic. They cause people to be more awake and more active, not sleepy. Calling them :narcotics makes as much sense as calling coffee a narcotic.\n[8] Answer Wiki. Caffeine is a CNS stimulant, whose principal mechanism of action is a nonselective antagonist of adenosine receptors... therefore a non-specific adenosine receptor agonist might be the pharmacological opposite of caffeine. In the real world, perhaps a zombification drug?\n[9] Caffeine Myth No. 1: Caffeine Is Addictive. This one has some truth to it, depending on what you mean by addictive.. Caffeine is a stimulant to the central nervous system, and regular use of caffeine does cause mild physical dependence. But caffeine doesn't threaten your physical, social, or economic health the way addictive drugs do.\n[10] Caffeine is a stimulant that naturally occurs in tea, coffee, and cocoa. Plants create the compound through nitrogen metabolism and it acts as a natural pesticide. Caffeine technically classified as a psychoactive drug, due to its stimulating effects on the nervous system.\n[11] Caffeine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant of the methylxanthine class of psychoactive drugs. It is the world's most widely consumed psychoactive drug, but unlike many other psychoactive substances, it is legal and unregulated in nearly all parts of the world.\n[12] Caffeine is naturally found in the leaves, beans, seeds, and fruits of many plants. It's also added to some foods and drinks and some pain relievers such as headache medicine. Caffeine is considered a drug. It works by exciting your nervous system which may make you feel more awake and alert. Having too much caffeine isn't healthy, and caffeine can be addictive.\n[13] Caffeine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant of the methylxanthine class of psychoactive drugs. It is the world's most widely consumed psychoactive drug, but unlike many other psychoactive substances, it is legal and unregulated in nearly all parts of the world.hen caffeine is consumed, it antagonizes adenosine receptors; in other words, caffeine prevents adenosine from activating the receptor by blocking the location on the receptor where adenosine binds to it. As a result, caffeine temporarily prevents or relieves drowsiness, and thus maintains or restores alertness.\n[14] If they tell you that marijuana, cocaine, and meth are narcotics then count them among the vast legions of totally clueless people on this subject. The word narcotic comes from the Greek word narkos, meaning sleep. Therefore, narcotics are drugs that induce sleep. Specifically, that means the opiates such as heroin, morphine and related drugs. This is the correct meaning, so you should accept no other. Cocaine and meth are not narcotics. They are stimulants, the exact opposite of a narcotic.

Calling them :narcotics makes as much sense as calling coffee a narcotic.\n[15] Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine, C8H10N4O2, mw 194.19), is a central nervous system stimulant. Acetaminophen (4'-hydroxyacetanilide, C8H9NO2, mw 151.16), is a non-opiate, non-salicylate analgesic and antipyretic.

In the real world, pe...\n[17] It is estimated that in the U.S., 75% of caffeine intake comes from coffee. caffeine stimulates the central nervous system by blocking adenosine, a neurotransmitter that normally causes a calming effect in the body.\n[18] 7. It's believed that some 3 out of 4 regular caffeine users are actually addicted to the substance. 8. After addiction, withdrawal from the use of caffeine can cause mood swings and irritability, similar to the symptoms of withdrawing from a narcotic or alcohol.\n[19] Caffeine is addictive; however, the NIH reports that moderate caffeine intake-- below 250 milligrams per day-- does not threaten a person's overall health. Consider adding natural sources of caffeine to your diet as nicotine substitutes. Some good sources of caffeine include coffee, tea and dark chocolate.\n[20] Caffeine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant of the methylxanthine class.(10) It is the world's most widely consumed psychoactive drug.

As the body heals, this tissue fills in the injury, and may eventually scar over. The scar may fade over time, especially if the wound is small. In some cases, the body produces too much granulation tissue, in a condition known as proud flesh, in which case medical treatment may be required to halt the overproduction. The appearance of granulation tissue is a good sign. When a wound starts granulating, it means that the body is starting to rebuild after the injury. This highly fibrous tissue is usually pink because the body produces numerous small blood vessels to provide a supply of oxygen and nutrients to remove waste.\n[11] 10 most extreme places on Earth.

The business strategy for your company defines the path that your business will take to achieve its goals. These goals include the elements of your business model, along with any additional missions or goals. It explains the steps, processes and changes that the business will follow and it identifies the strategies the business will to counteract potential upsets and hurdles. Achieving the model of the business strategy requires the efforts of every employee.\n[14] Business model, we. argue, is a reflection of the firm's realized strategy. We find that in simple. competitive situations there is a one-to-one mapping between strategy and business. model, which makes it difficult to separate the two notions.\n[15] The strategic plan can focus on the entire business or specific areas of the business, such as consumer marketing, customer retention and product introduction. As a result, businesses can have many strategic plans to address various areas of business. Difference between business strategy and business plan are: Business Plan\n[16] The former refers to defining the business logic of a company at the strategic level, whereas the latter refers to business process design at the operational level. A business model design template can facilitate the process of designing and describing a company's business model.\n[17] Business Model. A business plan describes what your company does. This written document states your company's operational and financial goals for the future and how it proposes to meet them. A business model describes how and where you choose to operate your company. The model you choose is detailed in your business plan.\n[18] Business Plan. In many cases, the business plan is the home of the business model and the business strategy. The business plan explains every aspect of the business, including the model and strategy, while identifying the affiliated staff, equipment and finances needed to achieve profit.\n[19] relationship between business models and strategy as depicted in Figure 2.

A radio wave is composed of an electrical wave, and a magnetic wave. The 2 waves travel together, creating each other as the wave travels through what ever medium it is in, be that air, wire, or what we call space. kerry k \u00b7 10 years ago.\n[2] For three of the four, you have named the medium ... rope, slinky, and. tuning fork. In each case, there would be no wave without it. The radio wave, as well as all other electromagnetic waves, can travel. through material media, but don't need one in order to propagate.\n[3] Electromagnetic waves: 1. Electromagnetic (EM) waves (example light waves, radio waves, x-rays etc) can travel through vacuum; they do not require any medium (matter) to travel through and their travel is reduced, to some extent, by the presence of any medium. The common examples of medium are glass, water, air etc.\n[4] (This includes visible light, radio waves, gamma rays, x-rays, ultraviolet rays, infra-red waves, and microwaves.) They both are able to travel through a medium of gas, liquid, or solid. Also, electromagnetic waves have the weird quantum property of sometimes acting like waves, and sometimes acting like particles.\n[5] S, India. Unlike sound waves or ocean waves, radios waves do not travel in a material. Radio waves are a class of electromagnetic waves and consist of nothing more than electric and magnetic fields. Since they don't require any medium through which to travel, they can go right through empty space.That's why we're able to see the stars, after all.adio waves are a class of electromagnetic waves and consist of nothing more than electric and magnetic fields. Since they don't require any medium through which to travel, they can go right through empty space.\n[6] Radio waves can travel in a vacuum, but sound waves need a physical medium. To explain \u2026 the apparent contradiction, the sound wave is converted to an electrical signal version that is then used to modulate the radio signal. 3 people found this useful. Asif Shaik.\n[7] So visible light travels through glass, but not thick wood. Radio waves are long and pass through buildings because of this. Also, gamma rays are short and therefore very high energy which is another way to pass though materials. Interestingly, very long radio waves drag in the earth and water, slowing down and will hug the Earth...\n[8] Since the actual oscillations take place at right angles to the direction of wave propagation, radio waves are transverse waves. Since radio waves are not mechanical, they do not need a medium to travel in; they can travel even in a vacuum. Like all types of electromagnetic waves, radio waves travel at a speed of about 300 000 km per second in a vacuum. When radio waves enter into other material, they slow down a little. When you tune a radio to listen to a particular frequency, the radio takes in the signals at that frequency.\n[9] Best Answer: How, five circular answers so far (radio waves don't need a medium because electromagnetic waves don't need a medium). There actually is a medium, of sorts. It's called the vacuum. It differs from media made of matter though in being Lorentz Invariant.\n[10] Radio waves do not travel well through water.Radio waves travel at the speed of light, and just like light, are absorbed by water, in the same way as the deeper you go the dar \u2026 ker it gets.\n[11] It's easy to be fooled by the fact that when you hear the word 'radio', you usually think of voices or music, but radio waves aren't sounds themselves \u2013 just the medium used to broadcast an electronic signal from the studio to your hi-fi, which the speaker then turns back into the vibrations in the air which we hear.\n[12] Medium wavelength radio waves are reflected from the ionosphere, a layer of charged particles in the upper atmosphere, so they can be used for long distance communication. Digital radio has better-quality reception as it uses digital signals and so does not have problems of noise and interference.\n[13] But by definition radio waves are not sound waves. Radio waves can travel in a vacuum, but sound waves need a physical medium. To explain \u2026 the apparent contradiction, the sound wave is converted to an electrical signal version that is then used to modulate the radio signal. 3 people found this useful. Asif Shaik.\n[14] It's simple. Radio waves travel unbelievably fast\u2014at the speed of light (300,000 km or 186,000 miles per second). Analog radio. Ocean waves carry energy by making the water move up and down. In much the same way, radio waves carry energy as an invisible, up-and-down movement of electricity and magnetism.\n[15] Radio wave, wave from the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum at lower frequencies than microwaves. The wavelengths of radio waves range from thousands of metres to 30 cm. These correspond to frequencies as low as 3 Hz and as high as 1 gigahertz (10 9 Hz). Radio-wave communications signals travel through the air in a straight line, reflect off of clouds or layers of the ionosphere, or are relayed by satellites in space. They are used in standard broadcast radio and television, shortwave radio, navigation and air-traffic control, cellular telephony, and even remote-controlled toys.\n[16] Actually, radio waves travel very quickly through space. Radio waves are a kind of electromagnetic radiation, and thus they move at the speed of light. The speed of light is a little less than 300,000 km per second. At that speed, a beam of light could go around the Earth at the equator more then 7 times in a second.\n[17] Radio waves are reflected by many solid objects, such as wood, stone, and notably metal, allowing the use of microwaves in radar applications. Also importantly in broadcast radio, the ionosphere (an upper layer of the Earth's atmosphere) can bounce signals back down to locations beyond the line-of-sight horizon. 3 people found this useful.\n[18] As someone else already posted, radio waves are a form of electromagnetic radiation. As such, they propagate at the speed of light. Theoretically they have an infinite range, but since they lose energy as the inverse square of the distance travelled, they become very weak quickly and are drowned out by more energetic local sources.\n[19] No, a radio wave is not a mechanical wave.
