When taken in the first month of pregnancy, NSAIDs have been shown to cause some women to miscarry.\n[14] Pregnant women who are infected with either herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) or herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) genital herpes have a higher risk for miscarriage, premature labor, retarded fetal growth, or transmission of the herpes infection to the infant while in the uterus or at the time of delivery..regnant women who are infected with either herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) or herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) genital herpes have a higher risk for miscarriage, premature labor, retarded fetal growth, or transmission of the herpes infection to the infant while in the uterus or at the time of delivery..\n[15] Most of the time, a specific cause for miscarriage cannot be identified, though up to 70 percent of first-trimester miscarriages, and 20 percent of second-trimester miscarriages, are caused by chromosomal anomalies. Other possible causes could include infection or exposure to environmental or industrial toxins.\n[16] The increased incidence of chromosomal abnormalities contributes to the age-related risk of miscarriage. Note: There is no proof that stress or physical or sexual activity causes miscarriage. Sometimes, treatment of a mother's chronic illness can improve the chances for a successful pregnancy.\n[17] (Most miscarriages occur in the first seven weeks of pregnancy, and chromosomal abnormalities are generally to blame.) In fact, studies have found that the chance of a miscarriage increases when the baby's heart rate is less than 100 beats per minute at 6.2 weeks gestation or less than 120 beats per minute at 6.3-7 weeks.\n[18] If you are having miscarriage symptoms, remember to see your doctor as soon as possible for diagnostic testing. Your pregnancy may still go on to be normal, or you may indeed be experiencing pregnancy loss. If a miscarriage is in fact taking place, remember that miscarriage causes are almost never the mother's fault.\n[19] Your Care Instructions. A miscarriage is the loss of a pregnancy during the first 20 weeks. Miscarriages are very common. Most happen because the fertilized egg in the uterus does not develop normally. Stress, exercise, or sex does not cause a miscarriage. While many miscarriages pass on their own, some do not. These are called incomplete miscarriages because all of the tissue related to pregnancy is not shed from the uterus. An incomplete miscarriage often requires treatment. Medicine or a procedure call dilation and curettage (D&C) is used to clear the tissue from the uterus. If your blood type is Rh negative, ask your doctor or midwife if you need a shot of Rh immune globulin (WinRho) to prevent problems in future pregnancies.\n[20] It is not known why this occurs. Signs of this would be a loss of pregnancy symptoms and the absence of fetal heart tones found on an ultrasound. Recurrent Miscarriage (RM): Defined as 3 or more consecutive first trimester miscarriages. This can affect 1% of couples trying to conceive.

If an expectant mom has this condition, she will be treated with antibiotics and her ob-gyn will ensure that her uterus has been completely evacuated.\n[2] 1 Abnormalities in the uterus, like scar tissue or uterine fibroids, can cause late miscarriages \u2014 after three months. 2 Smoking, the use of alcohol or cocaine, and heavy caffeine use have all been tied to miscarriage. Women who are underweight or overweight have a greater risk of miscarriage than other women.\n[3] Call your doctor immediately if you have recently been treated for a miscarriage and you are experiencing: 1 Severe vaginal bleeding without signs of shock. 2 If your doctor does not respond immediately, or if you do not have a doctor, have someone drive you to the nearest emergency room.3 Symptoms of infection.all your doctor immediately if you have recently been treated for a miscarriage and you are experiencing: 1 Severe vaginal bleeding without signs of shock. 2 Symptoms of infection. 3 Fever of 100.4\u00b0F (38\u00b0C) or higher. 4 Moderate to severe abdominal (belly) pain or cramping. 5 Vaginal discharge that smells bad.\n[4] A small percentage (4.5 percent) of couples with recurrent early miscarriages may be experiencing balanced translocation. In this condition, a healthy person's chromosomes are rearranged, meaning he or she could pass on too much of one chromosome and too little of another, creating a genetically abnormal embryo.ater recurrent losses (between 10 and 20 weeks) are less likely to be from genetic factors. If you have lost two or more pregnancies after 10 weeks, doctors are more likely to find clotting disorders, such as antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, or very rare abnormal immune reactions.\n[5] Urinary tract infection with classic symptoms and signs of urinary frequency, dysuria, and fever is a common cause of fever in pregnancy. The diagnosis is based on clinical findings and a urine specimen containing greater than 105 colony forming U/mL. The majority of UTIs are caused by gastrointestinal organisms.\n[6] Though it is normal to have hot flashes during pregnancy, you should make sure it is not a fever. Fever could imply an infection and may lead to serious complications. If you find something wrong within the body, you should consult your healthcare provider to diagnose the right cause.

The bacterial strains most associated with miscarriage are Listeria, Salmonella, Toxoplasma, and E. coli. No method of avoiding food poisoning is ever entirely foolproof, but avoiding the foods at highest risk of harboring these bacteria will go a long way toward reducing your risk of miscarriage from food poisoning.

You need to tell your doctor if you have ever had symptoms of, been exposed to, or been diagnosed with genital herpes. Sometimes genital herpes infection can lead to miscarriage.\n[2] Here we will discuss how to treat fever during pregnancy in 7 simple ways. 1 Use cold compresses-place a cool, damp washcloth over your forehead or the back of your neck. 2 Stay in an airy place. 3 Turn on an overhead or vertical fan and rest within the area of the fan's movement or atmosphere.\n[3] A vaginal infection, such as bacterial vaginosis or, very rarely, group B Streptococcus. It's possible, but unlikely, that these infections track up the vagina into your uterus. Any serious illness involving your heart and blood circulation, or your liver or kidneys could cause a late miscarriage.\n[4] While you are pregnant, you may also have other common problems, like a cold, mild headache, backache, mild fever, or the flu, that are not caused by your pregnancy. These minor symptoms generally do not cause problems or hurt your baby.\n[5] A high fever \u2014 common during the flu \u2014 may also affect your baby's development if you're still in the first trimester. You can use acetaminophen (Tylenol) to keep your temp under control (see Page 2 for treatments, prevention and more resources).lu is short for influenza, a potentially serious respiratory illness. Some people think of the flu as a cold on steroids, and while that's what it feels like, the flu is potentially deadly. In 2009, 75 pregnant women died from the H1N1 flu virus.\n[6] In other cases, certain illnesses or medical conditions can cause miscarriage and may increase the risk of miscarriage. Mothers who have diabetes or thyroid disease are at increased risk of miscarriage. Infections that spread to the placenta, including some viral infections, can also increase the risk of miscarriage. In general, risk factors for miscarriage include the following: 1 Older maternal age.\n[7] Most women with recurrent miscarriage have recurrent early miscarriage \u2014 either the failure of the development of an ultrasonographically recognizable embryo or embryonic death before 10 weeks' gestation; however, signs and symptoms of the miscarriage (uterine bleeding and cramping) may appear after 10 weeks. A smaller proportion of women with recurrent miscarriage have late miscarriage (death of the conceptus at or after 10 weeks' gestation), usually before 15 to 16 weeks. 8 Causes and recurrence rates for late miscarriage may differ from those for early miscarriage. Recurrent miscarriage is a distressing problem.\n[8] The UTI on its own cannot cause a miscarriage or pre term labor.

But this is not common. It happens less than 5% of the time among all pregnant women with parvovirus B19 infection, and it happens more commonly during the first half of pregnancy.\n[4] Are fever and chills early signs of pregnancy? Having body temperature above the normal limit of 98.6\u00b0 F (37\u00b0 C) is considered a fever (1). Fever and chills are not counted among the normal signs of pregnancy as they might indicate several underlying conditions (2).\n[5] 1 It may even be a sign that all is well with you and your baby. 2 Morning sickness may be associated with a lower risk of miscarriage.

Some known causes of miscarriage include: 1 Chromosomal abnormalities. 2 Studies show that 50% to 60% of all miscarriages are caused by chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus.\n[17] Infection during the third trimester can cause a miscarriage. These include an older parent, previous miscarriage, exposure to tobacco smoke, obesity, diabetes, and drug or alcohol use, among others. Multiple pregnancy and age\n[18] Most of the time, a specific cause for miscarriage cannot be identified, though up to 70 percent of first-trimester miscarriages, and 20 percent of second-trimester miscarriages, are caused by chromosomal anomalies. Other possible causes could include infection or exposure to environmental or industrial toxins.\n[19] 1 Abnormalities in the uterus, like scar tissue or uterine fibroids, can cause late miscarriages \u2014 after three months. 2 Smoking, the use of alcohol or cocaine, and heavy caffeine use have all been tied to miscarriage. Women who are underweight or overweight have a greater risk of miscarriage than other women.\n[20] Several intercurrent diseases in pregnancy can potentially increase the risk of miscarriage, including diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), hypothyroidism, certain infectious diseases, and autoimmune diseases.\nSearch Query: can fever cause miscarriage early pregnancy.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Some ways STIs can harm the baby include: low birth weight, dangerous infections, brain damage, blindness, deafness, liver problems, or stillbirth.\n[6] Stress does not cause miscarriage. It's completely normal to be worried about the pregnancy after struggling with infertility. Early pregnancy after fertility treatment is often more medically stressful, too, as there may be more scans and blood work checking that the pregnancy is developing normally.\n[7] In fact, because fevers during pregnancy can cause many risks to the developing baby, doctors recommend that you take acetaminophen if your fever is 101 degrees Fahrenheit or higher.\n[8] Marshfield researchers conducted a similar study among pregnant women during the 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 flu seasons, and found no association between the flu vaccine and miscarriage. The Marshfield study had several limitations, including the small number of women who had miscarriages and who received vaccinations two years in a row.\n[9] But there is a small chance the virus can infect the fetus.

Smoking, drinking, and using drugs: Smoking, drinking alcohol, and using drugs like cocaine and MDMA (ecstasy) during pregnancy can all increase your risk for miscarriage.\n[7] A uterine abnormality often causes a miscarriage due to early labor, but it can also cause fetal demise, which is what happened to our Casey. Sixteen weeks into my pregnancy with Emily, we had an abnormal AFP screening. Since we were near the point of the pregnancy when Casey died, naturally we were frantic.\n[8] Scientists at Marshfield compared 485 pregnant women, ages 18 to 44, who had a miscarriage to 485 pregnant women of similar ages who had normal deliveries during the flu seasons of 2010-2011 and 2011-2012.

In rare cases, it can cause birth defects. In some studies, fever during the first trimester has been linked to an increase in the risk of cleft palate, heart defects, and neural tube defects. These studies did not consider the underlying cause of the fevers, however, so there are questions about whether the cause for concern is the fever itself or whatever is causing the fever, such as an infection.\n[2] While colds and flu will not harm your baby a fever can be dangerous. Speak to your doctor if your temperature becomes high, for safe methods of reducing fever. There is some evidence to show that certain virulent flu viruses can cause miscarriage.\n[3] 1 A temperature above 103F (39.50C) during early weeks of pregnancy (usually the first trimester) may be responsible for a miscarriage, spinal cord or mental defects in the baby. Fever in early pregnancy may cause more harm than fever in late pregnancy.\n[4] However, diarrhea can also be a sign of infection. Although it doesn't cause miscarriage, diarrhea can affect a pregnancy. An occasional loose stool can be normal, but if you have any of the following, contact your physician: Diarrhea for more than 3 days. Fever of 100.4 F or higher. Severe abdominal or rectal pain.\n[5] A temperature higher than 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit \u2013 or the illness causing the fever \u2013 could harm both you and your developing baby.

So if you do become ill and have an elevated temperature, take acetaminophen as soon as possible to safely bring your fever down -- and then call your doctor right away.\n[7] Best Answer: A fever is not a symptom of pregnancy. A slightly higher than normal basal body temperature (not a fever) may occur in a small percentage of women but for it to be attributed to pregnancy a doctor would look for the temperature to be elevated consistently for more than two weeks.\n[8] Patients soon develop fever and muscle aches. 1 While pregnant women usually get a mild flu-like illness, listeria infection can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery, or fatal infection of the newborn. Other adults may develop headache, stiff neck, mental confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions.\n[9] But much as mild fevers may help boil away bacterial infections, some degree of nausea and vomiting, at least during the early stages of pregnancy, may be helpful and adaptive\u2014an evolved mechanism that protects both the fetus and mother.\n[10] fever a symptom of pregnancy Save this for later.

Back to the Top. Patterns.\n[2] The most common size is 12 gauge, with up to 50% of the overall shotgun market in the United States. The 20 gauge shotgun is favored by shooters uncomfortable with the weight and recoil of a 12 gauge gun, and is popular for upland game hunting. The next most popular sizes are 28 gauge and .410 bore.he fact that most shotgun bores are not cylindrical also causes deviations from the ideal bore diameter. The chamber of the gun is larger, to accommodate the thickness of the shotshell walls, and a forcing cone in front of the chamber reduces the diameter down to the bore diameter.\n[3] Forcing cones. The area just forward of your shotgun's chamber is the forcing cone; a funnel reducing the diameter of the chamber - down to bore size. An excited shooter was worried that the forcing cone area might be damaged by tough wads. Blaming plastic wads for impact is like blaming football shoulder pads for hard impacts.\n[4] They also think they are some type of machine gun-lite, having perceived lethality of machine guns but not-quite-as-fast. Lastly, they believe their power comes from detachable magazines, making them several times more deadly than a hunting rifle. That's what the most ignorant non-gun owners think they do. The reality, of course, is quite different. They do not understand things like terminal ballistics. They don't or can't believe a hunting rifle is far more dangerous, round for round. They don't or can't believe semi-autos are used for hunting. They are.\n[5] Reminder: Firearms registration is REQUIRED for all hunters who intend to participate in any upland game bird or spring turkey hunts. Use the form on the Registration page, and fax or mail it with a copy of your County registration for each shotgun you intend to use on PTA.\n[6] For a little background on the shell itself, let's go back to 1988, the year when it started. 1988 was the year that Mossberg introduced the 3-1/2 inch 12 gauge and Federal Ammunition introduced 3-1/2 inch unfolded length shotshells to go along with it.\n[7] On Wildlife Manage Areas all hunters except waterfowl and dove hunters must display 400 square inches of hunter orange and wear a hunter orange cap during the open gun season for deer. Hunters participating in special dog seasons for rabbit and squirrel are required to wear a minimum of a hunter orange cap.\n[8] Select a shorter barrel shotgun such as one that is 20 inches long for use in home defense or personal protection. A shorter will be easier to handle and aim inside a home where walls and furniture must be considered.Choose a barrel length between 22 and 24 inches for shotguns to be used for turkey hunting.elect longer barrel shotguns, such as those with 30 inch barrels, for hunting ducks, geese or dove. Long range wing shots require a longer barrel and will produce better shot pattern results down range than a shorter barrel shotgun.\n[9] Hunters age 17 and under are required to wear a hunter (fluorescent) orange exterior garment or hat when hunting game mammals or upland game birds (except turkey) with any firearm. Details of the regulation: \u2022Exterior garment means a shirt, jacket, coat, vest or sweater. \u2022Hat means any head covering (hat, bandana).\n[10] When you pull the trigger on your shotgun, the firing pin in the gun strikes the primer of a shotgun shell, igniting the powder that emits a gas as it burns. The gas creates enough pressure to propel the wad-containing shot hard and fast enough to decimate the target.Z. or ounces tells you how much shot is in the shell. There is some correlation between the amount of shot and recoil. A 1-ounce shell will generally shoot lighter than a 1\u281b ounce shell. That said there are some very fast 7/8 ounce game loads with substantial kick.\n[11] The best competition shooters in the world choose the best shotguns in the world: and with five gold medals in five different Olympics and countless awards in prestigious international competitions, champions consider the SO5 over-and-under the finest competition shotgun ever made.hey can be sized and tailored to the shooter's individual dimensions and preferred configuration. Each is finished and checkered by hand with the utmost care. SO5 Competition shotguns are available, on request, with fitted stock blank and/or removable side-locks.\n[12] Most shotguns are categorized by a gauge measurement, although in some countries, the same measurement is known as the gun's bore. A shotgun's gauge (bore) can seem confusing at first, since the smaller the gun's gauge, the bigger the gun. Gauge is determined by calculating how many round lead balls equal to the diameter of the gun's internal bore it takes to equal 1 pound in weight.\n[13] Bore size is also a big consideration as the the heavy 12-, or even 10-, gauge shotguns can be painful to shoot for a weak, small, or untrained user. 16- or 20-gauge shotguns are available which have much less kick and thus are easier to handle for a wider range of users. 5. Select your choke.lso, you have to compensate for the spread of the shotgun, which is the range of the shot in each shell. They have a fairly wide range, which means that you're aiming for the neighborhood of each target, and that you don't have to be directly on it.\n[14] Which is why some 30 years ago the veteran fox hunter and co-founder of the Coakham, Nigel Budd, decided to develop a sport that would combine all the arts of venery together with a controllable quarry,.\n[15] First things first: the gun itself. A shotgun's primary purpose is hunting. Clearly, you can use this shotgun as a hunting weapon to \"restock\" on valuable calories. Humans can go for three weeks without food, but it's not fun. Lack of food leads to light-headedness, weakness, and poor decisions. In a survival situation, meat is the fastest and most effective way to replenish lost calories.\n[16] The only shotgun on this list and outstrips all other shotguns in terms of popularity. At least 10 million of these 1951 pump-action models have been officially rolled out the gates of Remington-licensed factories due to their ability to fire up to a 28 gauge cartridge and cheapness to produce.\n[17] However, precision target pistols such as those used in Bullseye and IHMSA almost universally use traditional rifling, as do target rifles. The debate among target shooters is almost always one of cut vs. button rifled barrels, as traditional rifling is dominant.\n[18] If you're a waterfowler, you already know the benefits of Hevi Shot\u00ae -- it's 10% heavier than lead, 54% denser than steel and produces superior downrange pattern densities that make cleaner kills at greater distances.\n[19] The Stoeger Model 3000 semi automatic shotgun has a lineage that is directly tied to the proven Benelli Inertia Driven action mechanism.\n[20] Offered in a variety of sizes, Mossberg Accu-Choke Tubes provide consistent pattern performance for hunting and recreational shooting.These convenient tubes screw into and out of Mossberg shotguns quickly and easily for on-the-fly changes.ffered in a variety of sizes, Mossberg Accu-Choke Tubes provide consistent pattern performance for hunting and recreational shooting.\nSearch Query: why do hunters pattern their shotguns?.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

What this means is you can't simply buy your buddy's gun or snatch one from the dealer's shelf and simply start shooting it.\n[2] WHAT IS SHOTGUN CHOKE? Shotgun choke is the constriction at the muzzle end of the gun that tightens the pattern of pellets. In an average cartridge there are approximately 300 pellets, so how wide the shot pattern or how restricted is a matter than will make all the difference to your shooting.\n[3] 2. All the ranges are set up to minimize any chance of ricochet, over shooting etc., with effective backstops, marked shooting lanes and stops to prevent long guns from being accidentally swung left to right, the shooting booth is typically too narrow to do so with some sort of wall or post to protect against this. 3. Members are HYPER vigilant.\n[4] A shotgun (also known as a scattergun and peppergun, or historically as a fowling piece) is a firearm that is usually designed to be fired from the shoulder, which uses the energy of a fixed shell to fire a number of small spherical pellets called shot, or a solid projectile called a slug. backpacker shotgun has a short barrel and either a full-size stock or pistol grip, depending on legislation in intended markets. The overall length of these weapons is frequently less than 90 cm (35 in), with some measuring up at less than 63 cm (25 in).\n[5] Not only can they be used as what they are intended for-shotguns, but also make great pistol, revolver and rifle targets. Note the clay pigeon hanger below. It makes for a challenging pistol target setup from around 30-40 feet. It's made out of just a few 2x4s and some clothes hangers cut in 12 inch lengths.e set up all our stuff, do our shooting and then go to work. The range is always ready for the next shooters when we leave. That means not only do we clean up after ourselves, but also after whoever was there before us. The range is clean, all targets removed, and the sidewalk and pavilion swept clean.\n[6] Shotgun Choke Tubes: A choke tube is; a removable interior tube at the end of a shotgun barrel that controls shot dispersion. Choke tubes typically come in cylinder, improved cylinder, modified, improved modified, full and extra full.A cylinder choke tube produces a very wide shot dispersion, whereas a extra full choke tube will provide a much tighter shot pattern. Different chokes are used for skeet, trap, and sporting clays.hoke tube selection is a confusing issue amongst a lot of shotgunners but one that is easily explained. Everyone knows how to pattern a shotgun and what they are looking for, which is the ultimate full choke pattern at 40 yards, which is a 70% shot pattern, it is this area where it all gets fuzzy and needs explaining.\n[7] A shotgun shell is a self-contained cartridge typically loaded with multiple metallic shot , which are small, generally spherical projectiles. Traditionally lead was used, but increasingly steel, tungsten or bismuth shot has replaced lead, due to laws designed to protect the environment.ost shotgun shells contain multiple pellets in order to increase the likelihood of a target being hit. A shotgun's shot spread refers to the two-dimensional pattern that these projectiles (or shot) leave behind on a target.\n[8] Some guns (1911, springfield XD) have a grip safety which requires you to have your hand firmly on the gun's grip when you fire. Rifles and shotguns have a lot more variations in where the safety, or, in military rifles, a selector, is placed. I'm not familiar with hunting rifles and shotguns.\n[9] A premium gun in every respect, the SO5 is a sidelock shotgun optimized for bringing clay shooters to the podium, also thanks to the ability to personalize it to the competitor's individual measurements.hey can be sized and tailored to the shooter's individual dimensions and preferred configuration.

SO5 Competition shotguns are available, on request, with fitted stock blank and/or removable side-locks.\n[10] Over 64,000 gun fans have descended on Las Vegas for the first major gun show of 2016 - and a triple barrel shotgun is among the new weapons on display at the Shooting, Hunting and Outdoor Trade Show. Called the Triple Crown, its maker Chiappa launched new models at the show. At first glance, it looks just like a normal shotgun - but actually has a third barrel above the traditional two. Scroll down for video. Called the Triple Crown, Chiappa says the rifle is perfect for both hunter as as a weapon for self defence.\n[11] In firearms, a choke is a tapered constriction of a shotgun barrel's bore at the muzzle end. Chokes are almost always used with modern hunting and target shotguns, to improve performance. Its purpose is to shape the spread of the shot to gain better range and accuracy. Chokes are implemented as either screw-in chokes, selected for particular applications, or as fixed, permanent chokes, integral to the shotgun barrel. Chokes may be formed at the time of manufacture either as part of the barrel, b\n[12] In firearms, a choke is a tapered constriction of a shotgun barrel's bore at the muzzle end.Chokes are almost always used with modern hunting and target shotguns, to improve performance. Their purpose is to shape the spread of the shot in order to gain better range and accuracy.n the case of choke tubes, the amount of choke for each barrel is usually stamped on the side of the choke tube, or there may be thin slots cut in the exposed rim of the tube at the barrel opening with the number of slots corresponding to the number of *'s in this table.\n[13] Offered in a variety of sizes, Mossberg Accu-Choke Tubes provide consistent pattern performance for hunting and recreational shooting.These convenient tubes screw into and out of Mossberg shotguns quickly and easily for on-the-fly changes.ffered in a variety of sizes, Mossberg Accu-Choke Tubes provide consistent pattern performance for hunting and recreational shooting.\n[14] Select a shorter barrel shotgun such as one that is 20 inches long for use in home defense or personal protection. A shorter will be easier to handle and aim inside a home where walls and furniture must be considered.Choose a barrel length between 22 and 24 inches for shotguns to be used for turkey hunting.elect longer barrel shotguns, such as those with 30 inch barrels, for hunting ducks, geese or dove. Long range wing shots require a longer barrel and will produce better shot pattern results down range than a shorter barrel shotgun.\n[15] Bore size is also a big consideration as the the heavy 12-, or even 10-, gauge shotguns can be painful to shoot for a weak, small, or untrained user. 16- or 20-gauge shotguns are available which have much less kick and thus are easier to handle for a wider range of users. 5. Select your choke.lso, you have to compensate for the spread of the shotgun, which is the range of the shot in each shell. They have a fairly wide range, which means that you're aiming for the neighborhood of each target, and that you don't have to be directly on it.\n[16] The most common size is 12 gauge, with up to 50% of the overall shotgun market in the United States. The 20 gauge shotgun is favored by shooters uncomfortable with the weight and recoil of a 12 gauge gun, and is popular for upland game hunting. The next most popular sizes are 28 gauge and .410 bore.he fact that most shotgun bores are not cylindrical also causes deviations from the ideal bore diameter. The chamber of the gun is larger, to accommodate the thickness of the shotshell walls, and a forcing cone in front of the chamber reduces the diameter down to the bore diameter.\n[17] When you pull the trigger on your shotgun, the firing pin in the gun strikes the primer of a shotgun shell, igniting the powder that emits a gas as it burns. The gas creates enough pressure to propel the wad-containing shot hard and fast enough to decimate the target.Z. or ounces tells you how much shot is in the shell. There is some correlation between the amount of shot and recoil. A 1-ounce shell will generally shoot lighter than a 1\u281b ounce shell. That said there are some very fast 7/8 ounce game loads with substantial kick.\n[18] If you're a waterfowler, you already know the benefits of Hevi Shot\u00ae -- it's 10% heavier than lead, 54% denser than steel and produces superior downrange pattern densities that make cleaner kills at greater distances.\n[19] The Beretta 680 series shotguns incorporate self-adjusting dual, conical shaped, locking lugs. The conical (tapered) shape of the locking lugs allow the lugs, in conjunction with the top lever mentioned below, to be self-adjusting and compensate for wear.hen you purchase a any Beretta 680 series shotgun you have the assurance of having a gun made to same design and with the very same parts as our most elaborate 687 Giubileo only the cosmetics and shooting venue specific details (trap, skeet, sporting, field) differ.\n[20] Compared to the Beretta 680-series shotguns, the 692 features a wider receiver--measuring at 41.6mm or 1.6.. The advantage of this on a sporting gun is that it adds more weight to the gun, placing this extra weight between your hands. Head-Turner at the Range or in the Field. The 692's look combines the traditional design of the Beretta over-unders with cutting-edge technological solutions. The receiver design is elegant and technical, with a shiny-polished profile on side panels and bottom.\nSearch Query: why do hunters pattern their shotguns?.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Low prices on the Mossberg Maverick 88 12- Gauge start at Champion Firearms-Held To A Higher Standard. Shotguns have long been the gold standard for personal protection, and for good reason.\n[2] This shotgun features a 3 inch chamber for the heaviest waterfowl and turkey loads and in addition is drilled and tapped for a Weaver scope base to mount scopes, red dots or reflex sights for hunting.\n[3] The shotgun is probably the most versatile hunting weapon in the world. In a world where purpose specific shotguns sell for upwards of $2,000, a simple pump shotgun can \"get the job done\" for a fraction of that price. Don't get me wrong. There is a semi-auto Benelli duck gun on my wish list.\n[4] Bear hunters, like most hunters, can be pretty rigid in their opinions on what works and what doesn't. The topic they are most likely to take a staunch stand on is, of course, baiting.\n[5] he swears up and down that you can only have 3 shells, and if your hunting with a pump, you have to have the plug in the gun to limit you down to 3 shells just like a semi auto, reguardless of what your hunting, you can only have 3 shells in the gun. now we both have valid arguements that make sense for our stance.\n[6] Shotguns are the only firearm allowed for hunting game birds (except crow). Pistols, revolvers, rifles, and shotguns may be used to hunt crow. Bows, which include longbows, compound bows, and recurve bows, illuminated sights, scopes, quickpoint sights and hand-held string releasing mechanisms may be used. Atlatls.\n[7] A shotgun is generally a smoothbore firearm, which means that the inside of the barrel is not rifled. Preceding smoothbore firearms, such as the musket, were widely used by armies in the 18th century. backpacker shotgun has a short barrel and either a full-size stock or pistol grip, depending on legislation in intended markets. The overall length of these weapons is frequently less than 90 cm (35 in), with some measuring up at less than 63 cm (25 in).\n[8] Closing the dominant eye to use rifle sights is uncomfortable and feels unnatural. Worse, a shotgunner pointing with both eyes open won't get a good reference for the barrel position: instead of seeing the bead at the end of a rib, he might see the side of the barrel as the wrong eye asserts dominance.\n[9] There is only one way to know for sure what shot pattern to expect from a specific shotgun. Create a target from a 30-inch or larger piece of paper. Stand 40 yards away and point and shoot at the center of your target. Repeat this with different shotshell brands and different shot sizes.\n[10] Drawing on our experience as hunters and driven by the obsession to get as close as possible, we introduced the ultimate open-range pattern. Mossy Oak Brush blends grasses, dirt, natural brush elements and subtle shadows to provide the ultimate concealment in places once impossible to find cover.\n[11] WHAT IS SHOTGUN CHOKE? Shotgun choke is the constriction at the muzzle end of the gun that tightens the pattern of pellets. In an average cartridge there are approximately 300 pellets, so how wide the shot pattern or how restricted is a matter than will make all the difference to your shooting.\n[12] A shotgun shell is a self-contained cartridge typically loaded with multiple metallic shot , which are small, generally spherical projectiles. Traditionally lead was used, but increasingly steel, tungsten or bismuth shot has replaced lead, due to laws designed to protect the environment.ost shotgun shells contain multiple pellets in order to increase the likelihood of a target being hit. A shotgun's shot spread refers to the two-dimensional pattern that these projectiles (or shot) leave behind on a target.\n[13] In firearms, a choke is a tapered constriction of a shotgun barrel's bore at the muzzle end.

Choke tubes typically come in cylinder, improved cylinder, modified, improved modified, full and extra full.A cylinder choke tube produces a very wide shot dispersion, whereas a extra full choke tube will provide a much tighter shot pattern. Different chokes are used for skeet, trap, and sporting clays.hoke tube selection is a confusing issue amongst a lot of shotgunners but one that is easily explained.

While the basic concept has stayed the same, some turnbolt designs stand out from the rest. Bolt-action rifles became popular with military forces in the early twentieth century, and hunters soon began using sporterized versions of these early military arms for taking game of all sizes. Since that time, the bolt-action has become the most popular choice for big game hunting for a number of reasons.\n[9] Low prices on the Mossberg 500 12- Gauge start at Champion Firearms-Held To A Higher Standard.

When a tournament is on the line, skeet and trap shooters want the edge they gain when using a good choke tube.efore the invention of choke, all barrels were simply straight tubes with an effective killing range of about 25 to 30 yards. Hits beyond that distance were a matter of luck.\n[2] Shotgun chokes, whether they be screw-in choke tubes or fixed-chokes (permanent part of the barrel) are used to control the diameter and density of the pellet pattern at a spe \u2026 cific distance. Example: An improved cylinder (IC) choke would produce a larger diameter (more open) pattern at around 30 yards.\n[3] I think you hit the nail on the head as to the origins of hunting in Australia, it more or less rose as a necessity for agriculturists. Basically, all hunters in Australia are encouraged to kill as many pigs, foxes, rabbits, goats, cats and dogs as they can, as every one dead helps our messed up ecosystems.oos would be thinner skinned and smaller than your white tail deer, but maybe .223 is too small for that. Professional roo shooters usually use .222 or .223 but they are more concerned with price, and rarely miss a head shot anyway.\n[4] Just remember...what the choke tube says it is on the choke doesn't mean it will throw that pattern in a 30 circle at 40 yds.(how it is determined..the % of shot in the circle) You have to pattern it for your gun.\n[5] If you choose to hunt with a shotgun, the recommended shot size if 5 or 6 on a shotgun with a 28\" or 30\" barrel length. Shotgun shells tend to be more expensive than other ammo, and they take up a lot of space in your gear. The large recoil may limit some smaller-built hunters in endurance as well.\n[6] Shotgun keeps me fed. Rifle keeps me free.

Now I want to buy or build a brand new center fire bolt gun with Target sights, this is harder than I thought.\n[7] Same basic answer applies to a round of clays. Nobody says you can't shoot a 20 gauge, but the guy beside you with his 12 gauge will be throwing more number 8 shot at the target for a larger or more dense pattern, depending on his choice of choke.\n[8] Many pheasant hunters, for example, look for \"high brass loads\" or \"heavy field loads\" to pursue tough rooster pheasants. A 12-gauge shotgun shell, for example, might be stuffed with 1\u00bd ounces of shot and a 3\u00be-dram equivalent load of powder. The logic is that if you're hunting pheasants, you're better off with more pellets and more powder to punch all that lead through the air and put more pellets into a tough bird.\n[9] The autoloader shotgun is arguably the best all-around trap gun for the first-time beginner. The reasons being; The stock is easily adjustable to set point of impact (a critical consideration), the gun can shoot all the games; singles, handicap, double-trap, sporting clays, you name it.

In the following years, all over Europe, flintlock ignition, muzzle loading \"fowling pieces\" developed slowly. The development of the double barrel side by side muzzle loaded shotgun reached its zenith when in 1793, Joseph Manton set up his shop in London England. Manton's guns were light, trim, and well-balanced.\n[2] 1988 was the year that Mossberg introduced the 3-1/2 inch 12 gauge and Federal Ammunition introduced 3-1/2 inch unfolded length shotshells to go along with it. Though the nationwide ban on lead shot for waterfowl hunting didn't happen until 1991, the path to that ban was well underway in the 1970s.\n[3] Shotgun choke is the constriction at the muzzle end of the gun that tightens the pattern of pellets.

This beautiful version of muzzle loading side by side shotgun, which reproduces an original English model has been the indispensable friend of the traditional hunter for many years. The stock is made of walnut, the blued barrels are slightly choked and inside chromed. The locks are engraved.\n[6] They use the same ammunition as other types of firearms. Semi-automatic firearms are popular for hunting, trap, skeet, informal target shooting and formal marksmanship competitions. One reason semi-automatic firearms are popular for recreational shooting is that they tend to have less recoil.hey use the same ammunition as other types of firearms.

This pattern is an updated and advanced version of the duck hunting staple Shadow Grass. Blades focuses on the confused state of grass in the natural waterfowl. Blades is expected to hit stores in Fall 2013.\n[8] Hunters of game have long made use of camouflage in the form of materials such as animal skins, mud, foliage, and green or brown clothing to enable them to approach wary game animals.\n[9] Messages: 4,002. Patern your gun and see which choke gives an acceptable pattern at the yardages you expect to break targets at. Not all chokes peform as marked. I have a Modified that gives a light full pattern and a full choke that gives a Modified pattern, at best. A Modified or Improved Modified PATTERN would do the trick for you at the yardages you mentioned. You can certainly go tighter if you desire to do so. I just shot an Improved Modified choke from well beyond the 27 yard line for the long range games this evening. I was in the money for one and in the top three for the next. A full choke would probably have done no better. The patterns from my full choke tube are very dense in the center but horrible outside the center ten inch circle.\n[10] When to use a smooth bore. Many shotguns come standard with a smooth bore barrel because that's what you need to have to shoot shot (shells that have bbs or multiple projectiles \u2013 these are used in bird hunting and other sporting situations). In addition to shooting shot, you can also shoot slugs out of a smooth bore barrel.\n[11] WHAT IS SHOTGUN CHOKE? Shotgun choke is the constriction at the muzzle end of the gun that tightens the pattern of pellets. In an average cartridge there are approximately 300 pellets, so how wide the shot pattern or how restricted is a matter than will make all the difference to your shooting.\n[12] Shotgun Choke Tubes: A choke tube is; a removable interior tube at the end of a shotgun barrel that controls shot dispersion. Choke tubes typically come in cylinder, improved cylinder, modified, improved modified, full and extra full.A cylinder choke tube produces a very wide shot dispersion, whereas a extra full choke tube will provide a much tighter shot pattern. Different chokes are used for skeet, trap, and sporting clays.hoke tube selection is a confusing issue amongst a lot of shotgunners but one that is easily explained. Everyone knows how to pattern a shotgun and what they are looking for, which is the ultimate full choke pattern at 40 yards, which is a 70% shot pattern, it is this area where it all gets fuzzy and needs explaining.\n[13] Shotgun chokes, whether they be screw-in choke tubes or fixed-chokes (permanent part of the barrel) are used to control the diameter and density of the pellet pattern at a spe \u2026 cific distance. Example: An improved cylinder (IC) choke would produce a larger diameter (more open) pattern at around 30 yards.\n[14] In firearms, a choke is a tapered constriction of a shotgun barrel's bore at the muzzle end. Chokes are almost always used with modern hunting and target shotguns, to improve performance. Their purpose is to shape the spread of the shot in order to gain better range and accuracy.\n[15] In firearms, a choke is a tapered constriction of a shotgun barrel's bore at the muzzle end. Chokes are almost always used with modern hunting and target shotguns, to improve performance. Its purpose is to shape the spread of the shot to gain better range and accuracy.

Chokes may be formed at the time of manufacture either as part of the barrel, b\n[16] There is only one way to know for sure what shot pattern to expect from a specific shotgun. Create a target from a 30-inch or larger piece of paper. Stand 40 yards away and point and shoot at the center of your target. Repeat this with different shotshell brands and different shot sizes.\n[17] Offered in a variety of sizes, Mossberg Accu-Choke Tubes provide consistent pattern performance for hunting and recreational shooting.These convenient tubes screw into and out of Mossberg shotguns quickly and easily for on-the-fly changes.ffered in a variety of sizes, Mossberg Accu-Choke Tubes provide consistent pattern performance for hunting and recreational shooting.\n[18] Select a shorter barrel shotgun such as one that is 20 inches long for use in home defense or personal protection. A shorter will be easier to handle and aim inside a home where walls and furniture must be considered.Choose a barrel length between 22 and 24 inches for shotguns to be used for turkey hunting.elect longer barrel shotguns, such as those with 30 inch barrels, for hunting ducks, geese or dove. Long range wing shots require a longer barrel and will produce better shot pattern results down range than a shorter barrel shotgun.\n[19] Many pheasant hunters, for example, look for \"high brass loads\" or \"heavy field loads\" to pursue tough rooster pheasants. A 12-gauge shotgun shell, for example, might be stuffed with 1\u00bd ounces of shot and a 3\u00be-dram equivalent load of powder. The logic is that if you're hunting pheasants, you're better off with more pellets and more powder to punch all that lead through the air and put more pellets into a tough bird.\n[20] Same basic answer applies to a round of clays. Nobody says you can't shoot a 20 gauge, but the guy beside you with his 12 gauge will be throwing more number 8 shot at the target for a larger or more dense pattern, depending on his choice of choke.\nSearch Query: why do hunters pattern their shotguns?.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

That works fine if you're throwing out a cloud of pellets that can cover a 30-inch target circle by the time they're 30 yards from the muzzle.\n[4] Most patterns are designed to make the hunt \u2013 BOTTOMLAND went right ahead and built a camo company. Bottomland is Mossy Oak's original camo pattern, created by Toxey Haas two decades ago. This pattern preserves the original design while applying advanced technology for increased effectiveness.\n[5] Devoted to the use of muzzleloading shotguns for hunting, Trap, Skeet and other shooting sports. For most shooters, the phrase muzzle loader is synonymous with a muzzle loading rifle. However, there are a surprising number of shooters who, at least occasionally, shoot a muzzle loading shotgun.\n[6] Firearm hunters and bowhunters have a responsibility to make quick kills and recover. all game. One complaint that members of the public (other hunters and non-. hunters) have about hunters is \"slow deaths, wounded and unrecovered animals.\". Accurate shot placement is the key to a quick kill and game recovery. Necessary. ingredients of good shot placement are knowledge of how a hunting arm harvests game,\n[7] Mossberg ships these shotguns with a wood dowel in the magazine tube to limit the shotgun to 3 shots..... The reason is many areas require that a shotgun for hunting can not hold more than 3 cartridges... 1 in the chamber and 2 in the magazine tube... This keeps the gun legal no matter where Mossberg ships them....\n[8] These removable tubes control the dispersion of the shot fired from the shotgun. Changing the dispersion of the shot is useful if the same gun will be used in multiple sports, such as trap and skeet, or used in hunting different species of game, according to the website gunnersden.com.ylinder choke indicates no choke effect and is the most open choke, providing the widest dispersion of shot as it exits the barrel. Extra full is the tightest choke and concentrates the shot into the tightest pattern.\n[9] Shotgun chokes, whether they be screw-in choke tubes or fixed-chokes (permanent part of the barrel) are used to control the diameter and density of the pellet pattern at a spe \u2026 cific distance.\n[10] Cylinder choke is an unconstricted barrel. The shot pattern spreads quickly. Improved Cylinder choke has a slight constriction. It allows the shot pattern to spread fairly quickly. This is a good choice for quail, rabbits, and other upland game. Modified choke has moderate constriction. The shot stays together longer, making the pattern denser and more useful at longer ranges. This choke is used often for dove hunting and is the preferred choke when using steel shot to hunt for ducks or geese.\n[11] WHAT IS SHOTGUN CHOKE?

Understanding the Importance of Cartridge and Choke Performance. There's no difference between zeroing the rifle and patterning the shotgun. The process is both easy and beneficial. When hunting, it's important to adopt humane methods to capture the animal.\n[3] You now know what patterning a shotgun means, but why do hunters pattern their shotguns in the first place? When you shoot a shotgun while hunting, you want to make sure that you are familiarized with how it works, don't you?\n[4] This is called \"patterning your shotgun.\" All shotgun hunters need to pattern their firearms to determine which brands of shells, shot sizes, and loads perform best and at what range. A shotgun may have a good pattern (high density of hits), but shoot off target. If this is the case, you will need to have the stock adjusted by a gunsmith. \u2190 Previous\n[5] You will also need to learn how to use the particular gun you have, particularly the shotgun. Do you know about patterning the shotgun? If you do, you probably wonder about why do hunters pattern their shotguns. While it does seem like a tedious task at first, it reaps a ton of benefits hunters love, which is what makes it an important thing to do.\n[6] That's the reason why many hunters opt to test their shotguns and pattern it before intense hunting sessions. You wouldn't want to go in without knowing your gun well enough. Not only does this lessen the number of clean kills you can make, but it may also hurt something in the process due to inaccurate shooting.\n[7] Shotgun Choke and Shot Pattern. 1 Cylinder choke is an unconstricted barrel. The shot pattern spreads quickly. 2 Improved Cylinder choke has a slight constriction. It allows the shot pattern to spread fairly quickly. This is a good choice for quail, rabbits, and other upland game. 3 Modified choke has moderate constriction.\n[8] There is a tendency for the six-fold to be used with larger shot in hunting and field loads. Also, the smaller shells in the 28-gauge and the .410-bore use a six-fold crimp, and though it seems counter-intuitive, the large shells of a 10-gauge also use a six-fold crimp.ne purpose of the crimp is to seal the end of the shell to prevent the shot from falling out and keep dirt from entering. The crimp also keeps the powder and shot properly packed for that micro-second when the primer ignites the powder and pressure begins to build.\n[9] The shot pellets from a shotgun spread upon leaving the barrel, and the power of the burning charge is divided among the pellets, which means that the energy of any one ball of shot is fairly low. In a hunting context, this makes shotguns useful primarily for hunting birds and other small game. backpacker shotgun has a short barrel and either a full-size stock or pistol grip, depending on legislation in intended markets. The overall length of these weapons is frequently less than 90 cm (35 in), with some measuring up at less than 63 cm (25 in).\n[10] Mossberg ships these shotguns with a wood dowel in the magazine tube to limit the shotgun to 3 shots.....

In the case of alanine, the \u03b1-keto acid that accepts the amino group is \u03b1-ketoglutarate; this also applies to most other amino acids.Transamination is freely reversible; therefore, both glutamate and \u03b1-ketoglutarate are substrates of multiple transaminases.his is illustrated here for alanine, which transfers its amino group to \u03b1-ketoglutarate to become pyruvate. *Since we already know how to degrade pyruvate, transamination is all that is required to account for the degradation of alanine.\n[5] So in addition to availability of intracellular amino acids, protein synthesis/anabolism is also regulated in part by the transport of amino acids into and out of muscle cells. In animals (mainly carnivores) amino acids provide a generous amount of energy from the oxidation of amino acids.\n[6] Meat, poultry, and fish are food sources of L-Carnosine, however, as we age, the levels of L-Carnosine in our bodies greatly decreases. This could be responsible for the decrease in muscle mass and the strength of muscles in the elderly.ee products like bee pollen contain L-Carnosine which is being recognized for its incredible properties. In some countries this amino acid is considered a miracle worker. L-Carnosine is an amino acid that is comprised of beta-alanine and L-histidine.\n[7] L-carnosine, not to be confused with L-carnitine, is a substance manufactured in the human body, made by combining the amino acids alanine and histidine.

Beta-alanine is the generic name for the amino acid. NAI owns the CarnoSyn\u00ae trademark name and global patents for the use of beta-alanine in dietary supplements.\n[9] Healthy children and adults do not need to consume carnitine from food or supplements, as the liver and kidneys produce sufficient amounts from the amino acids lysine and methionine to meet daily needs .\n[10] The 10 amino acids that we can produce are alanine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamic acid, glutamine, glycine, proline, serine and tyrosine. Tyrosine is produced from phenylalanine, so if the diet is deficient in phenylalanine, tyrosine will be required as well.s we learn about amino acids, it is important to keep in mind that one of the more important reasons to understand amino acid structure and properties is to be able to understand protein structure and properties.\n[11] Amino acids released from dietary or intracellular proteins are catabolized in similar fashions. Their degradation begins with the removal of the a-amino group, thus leaving an a-keto acid hydrocarbon skeleton. Alpha-amino group removal from amino acids occurs through either transamination or deamination reactions. Transamination reactions are catalyzed by transaminases (also called aminotransferases).\n[12] Carnosine, also known as L-Carnosine is a natural antioxidant, made of the amino acids beta-alanine and histidine.

It is naturally produced by the body, although it is often taken as a dietary supplement. Acetylcarnitine is broken down in the blood by plasma esterases to carnitine which is used by the body to transport fatty acids into the mitochondria for breakdown.\n[16] Essential amino acids are the the ones that cannot be synthesized by digestion of other substances. The nine amino acids humans cannot synthesize are phenylalanine, valine, threonine, tryptophan, methionine, leucine, isoleucine,lysine, and histidine. I don't believe either BCAA or EAA will be used for gluconeogenesis as they are precursors for protein synthesis and not protein itself.\n[17] Carnitine may be involved because its concentration in tissues declines with age and thereby reduces the integrity of the mitochondrial membrane (12). Research in aged rats found supplementation with high doses of acetyl-L-carnitine and alpha-lipoic acid (an antioxidant) to reduce mitochondrial decay [13-15].\n[18] Aid Overall Health.

The amino acids glutamine and glutamic acid are closely related in a chemical sense.\n[2] L-carnitine amino acid science and know how 2016-01-23T05:38:42+00:00. L-carnitine plays a major role in the transport of fatty acids into the interior of cells. Once inside the cell, the fatty acids are converted to energy. Carnitine is thus of particular importance for processes with regard to energy supply and fat burning. Healthy individuals require approx. 300 mg L-carnitine per day.\n[3] Where it comes from: Carnitine (and L-carnitine) is a nutrient that helps the body break down fat and turn it into energy. It also increases the activity of certain nerve cells in the central nervous system. Carnitine is an amino acid naturally produced by the body in the liver and kidneys and stored in the skeletal muscles, heart, brain and sperm. The nutrient also occurs in fish, poultry, red meat and some types of dairy.\n[4] A non-essential amino acid that is a precursor to the production of a naturally occurring molecule called carnosine.

In the muscles, it forms a bond with another amino acid called histidine to form muscular Carnosine. The Carnosine works to fight off the molecules produced in the muscles that usually lead to fatigue and eventually failure.\n[7] Nutrients for L-carnitine Production. Niacin, vitamin B-6 and iron increase metabolism by assisting with the production of L-carnitine, an amino acid that promotes fat burning, notes Vanderbilt University. Your body synthesizes L-carnitine from the essential amino acids lysine and methionine in the liver.\n[8] Unlike fat and starch, the human body does not store excess amino acids for later use\u2014the amino acids must be in the food every day. The 10 amino acids that we can produce are alanine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamic acid, glutamine, glycine, proline, serine and tyrosine. Tyrosine is produced from phenylalanine, so if the diet is deficient in phenylalanine, tyrosine will be required as well. The essential amino acids are arginine (required for the young, but not for adults), histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine.\n[9] Carnitine itself isn't the problem. It's what happens when carnitine meets the bacteria in your intestines. When you tuck into a steak or swallow an l-carnitine capsule, the bacteria in your gut produce a chemical called trimethyl amine. Then your liver converts trimethyl amine into trimethylamine N-oxide, or TMAO. This byproduct gums up your arteries.\n[10] Nutrients for L-carnitine Production.

As the body ages l-carnosine concentrations decline for a couple of reasons. Firstly, the body makes less of this amino acids. Secondly, l-carnosine becomes more susceptible to destruction in older bodies.\n[9] In this case, carnitine substitution (food supplementation) is certainly worthwhile.

Your body synthesizes L-carnitine from the essential amino acids lysine and methionine in the liver.\n[13] Carnitine: What is it? Carnitine, derived from an amino acid, is found in nearly all cells of the body. Its name is derived from the Latin carnus or flesh, as the compound was isolated from meat. Carnitine is the generic term for a number of compounds that include L-carnitine, acetyl-L-carnitine, and propionyl-L-carnitine [1,2].\n[14] Where it comes from: Carnitine (and L-carnitine) is a nutrient that helps the body break down fat and turn it into energy. It also increases the activity of certain nerve cells in the central nervous system. Carnitine is an amino acid naturally produced by the body in the liver and kidneys and stored in the skeletal muscles, heart, brain and sperm. The nutrient also occurs in fish, poultry, red meat and some types of dairy.\n[15] Carnitine is a substance found in almost every cell in the body, it is biosynthesized from the amino acids lysine and methionine. The compound plays a crucial role in energy production, as it is responsible for transporting fatty acids to the mitochondria.Mitochondria exist inside every cell in our bodies.arnitine is a substance found in almost every cell in the body, it is biosynthesized from the amino acids lysine and methionine. The compound plays a crucial role in energy production, as it is responsible for transporting fatty acids to the mitochondria. Mitochondria exist inside every cell in our bodies.\n[16] L-carnitine is a compound consisting of the amino acids lysine and methionine. Both lysine and methionine are often used to improve athletic performance. Though there isn't a lot of empirical data, L-carnitine does possess weight loss abilities.This is because it plays a major role in the body's fat breakdown process.pecifically, L-carnitine is essential for converting body fat back into usable energy by moving fatty acids out of cells' cytoplasm and into their mitochondria. Once they are in the mitochondria, the fatty acids are used as energy rather than stored on the body.\n[17] What is Acetyl L Carnitine - ALCAR Introduction. Acetyl-L-Carnitine is an amino acid the body uses to turn fat into energy. It is not normally considered an essential nutrient because the body can manufacture all it needs. However, supplemental Carnitine may improve the ability of certain tissues to produce energy.\n[18] Acetyl-L-carnitine, ALCAR or ALC, is an acetylated form of L-carnitine. It is naturally produced by the body, although it is often taken as a dietary supplement. Acetylcarnitine is broken down in the blood by plasma esterases to carnitine which is used by the body to transport fatty acids into the mitochondria for breakdown.\n[19] L-carnitine for weight loss. Some studies have shown taking L-carnitine supplementation daily can increase the concentration of this amino acid in the muscles and blood stream, which is said to possibly enhance fat metabolism.\n[20] Carnitine and Hairloss. Carnitine is an amino acid that occurs naturally in the human body and is essential for turning fat into energy. Local active energy metabolism is an essential prerequisite for healthy, sustained hair growth.\nSearch Query: what amino produces carnitine.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: what amino produces carnitine.\n\n[1] But before I get into the details of this flawed study, let's first take a closer look at carnitine and what it does in your body. The Transporter. L-carnitine, or just carnitine (the L refers to the configuration of the carnitine molecule that is biologically active) is often referred to as an amino acid, but it is not a true amino acid. Carnitine is an amino acid-like compound that is made in the body from the amino acids lysine and methionine. Its name is derived from the Greek word for flesh or meat, carnus. Not so coincidentally, it's abundant in red meat and dairy products, but it can also be found in various nuts, grains, and green vegetables.\n[2] Acetyl L Carnitine is one of the more common formulations of L-Carnitine, which is itself an amino acid that is produced from two other amino acids (Lysine and Methionine). This version, or form, of L-Carnitine is significant more active than it parent compound due to a higher degree of bioavailability.\n[3] L-carnitine is synthesized in the body from the amino acids lysine and methionine. Learn how your chances of success can increase with this in your arsenal. L-carnitine is synthesized in the body from the amino acids lysine and methionine.Regardless of what your bodybuilding and fitness goals are, losing fat or gaining muscle, your chances of success will increase greatly if you have l-carnitine in your supplement arsenal.-carnitine is synthesized in the body from the amino acids lysine and methionine. Learn how your chances of success can increase with this in your arsenal. L-carnitine is synthesized in the body from the amino acids lysine and methionine.\n[4] L-Carnitine is an amino acid composite \u2013 one of the building blocks of protein. It is known to increase the number of androgen receptors in muscles. These receptors allow muscle to utilize testosterone resulting in an enhanced ability to build muscle.\n[5] Carnitine biosynthesis and metabolism. Carnitine, a branched non-essential amino acid, is synthesized from the essential amino acids lysine and methionine. Ascorbic acid, ferrous iron, pyroxidine and niacin are also necessary cofactors (1) and deficiencies of any of these can lead to carnitine deficiency.\n[6] Background. Carnitine is a naturally occurring hydrophilic amino acid derivative, produced endogenously in the kidneys and liver and derived from meat and dairy products in the diet.It plays an essential role in the transfer of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation.arnitine deficiency is a metabolic state in which carnitine concentrations in plasma and tissues are less than the levels required for normal function of the organism. Biologic effects of low carnitine levels may not be clinically significant until they reach less than 10-20% of normal.\n[7] The acetyl form of this amino acid possesses many of the same abilities as the regular l-carnitine variety but in a less significant way. While the acetyl form is known for its impact on cognitive abilities, the regular l-carnitine is primarily praised for its effects on metabolism and energy production.\n[8] While it is often categorized as an amino acid, L-carnitine isn't technically an amino. It is considered a vitamin-like and amino acid-like compound that is related to the B vitamins. When it was first studied back in the 1950s, L-carnitine was referred to as vitamin BT. L-carnitine is formed in the liver and kidneys from the amino acids lysine and methionine. However, it is stored elsewhere in the body, primarily in muscle (including the heart), the brain, and even in sperm. In the diet, it mainly comes from meat and other animal products.\n[9] Carnitine, derived from an amino acid, is found in nearly all cells of the body. Its name is derived from the Latin carnus or flesh, as the compound was isolated from meat. Carnitine is the generic term for a number of compounds that include L-carnitine, acetyl-L-carnitine, and propionyl-L-carnitine [1-2].\n[10] Carnitine, derived from an amino acid, is found in nearly all cells of the body.

It transports long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria so they can be oxidized (burned) to produce energy. It also transports the toxic compounds generated out of this cellular organelle to prevent their accumulation.\n[11] Nutrients for L-carnitine Production.

These boundaries are the product of a fall in sea level that erodes the subaerially exposed sediment surface of the earlier sequence or sequence s.he Hunt and Tucker (1992) suggest that this sequence boundary over the forced regression does not match Mitchum's (1977) original definition of a sequence boundary or its time equivalent marine correlative conformity that was tied to the onset of a sea level fall.\n[14] There may be a layer missing in the strata, or a set of sedimentary rock on top of metamorphic rock. These interfaces between discontinuous layers of rock are called unconformities. They complicate the task of relative dating, because they don't give an accurate picture of what happened in geologic history.\n[15] These erosional surfaces, which are extremely common in the geologic record, are collectively referred to as unconformities. Bear in mind that the vast majority of the rock material of which the geologic record is comprised consists, in and of itself, as recycled rock material.\n[16] Sequence Boundary.

The whole sequence may later be deformed and tilted by further orogenic activity.\n[4] In seismic science, a discontinuity is a surface (such as the boundary between rock units) where seismic waves abruptly change velocity. In structural geology, a discontinuity is a surface separating unrelated rock units such as a fault. The photo is an image of The Great Unconformity of the Grand Canyon.\n[5] A biconformity is when an older unconformity is directly overlain by a younger unconformity. Biconformity is an unconformity surface that represents two known unconformity surfaces of different ages but directly overlying each other as though they both were a single unconformity surface.\n[6] Sequence Boundary The sequence boundary is an unconformity updip and a correlative conformity downdip. Where it is an unconformity, it is a surface of subaerial exposure and erosion; however, the expression of those features in an individual outcrop may or may not be obvious.\n[7] Thanks for the A2A. An unconformity occurs when there is erosion of a layer or layers of deposited rock followed by the deposition of new sedimentary rock on top. It it called an unconformity because the ages of the layers of rock that are abutting each other are discontinuous at the unconformity.\n[8] For geologists, one of the most famous angular unconformity is the Grand Unconformity in the Grand Canyon of Arizona. Here tilted sedimentary rocks of Precambrian age (lower half of photo) are overlain by younger sedimentary rocks of Phanerozoic age (Cambrian and younger, upper half of photo).onconformities are unconformities that separate igneous or metamorphic rocks from overlying sedimentary rocks. They usually indicate that a long period of erosion occurred prior to deposition of the sediments (several km of erosion necessary).\n[9] In part 1, I looked at the phenomenon of the Great Unconformity, a gap between Grand Canyon layers that spans more than a quarter of Earth's history. Though geologists understand how unconformities like this occur, creationists have a rather different view about what formed the Great Unconformity.\n[10] They are surfaces of contact between older rocks and younger sedimentary rocks, formed due to erosion or lack of sediment deposition over extended periods of time.

During the Puritans time it was common of all people to act the same way, believe in the same ideas, and follow the same rules. Today in pop-culture numerous people,literature, and poems show that being a nonconformist is a good thing.\n[2] Boundary between parallel beds of sedimentary rock. that represents a considerable period of erosion or. non-deposition. \u25ba The layers of sedimentary rocks above and below the. unconformity are parallel with one another.

UNCONFORMITY: An apparent gap in the geologic record, as revealed by observing rock layers or strata. WEATHERING: The breakdown of rocks and minerals at or near the surface of Earth due to physical or chemical processes, or both.\n[4] This was not freshly made rock either, but oceanic crustal basalt that was 34 to 85 million years old. 1 In other words, the researchers discovered a strange 85 million year gap in the geological record. The finding was important enough to be published in the October 2006 Geology, and Science News also took note. Unconformities Are Gaps in the Geological Record Gaps in the geological record, like those discovered in 2005, are called unconformities because they do not conform to typical geological expectations.\n[5] an arrangement of rock layers in which the oldest rocks are at the bottom. Unconformity. a break in the geologic record created when rock layers are eroded or when sediment is not deposited for a long period of time.\n[6] Two types of unconformity are recognized, viz. disconformity and angular unconformity. Disconformity is a time break in a sequence of beds. Beds which should be present representing the time interval of their deposition are missing either due to non-deposition or due to their getting eroded before succeeding beds were deposited. See Fig. 17.42.\n[7] Definition of nonconformity. 1 1a : failure or refusal to conform to an established churchb often capitalized : the movement or principles of English Protestant dissentc often capitalized : the body of English Nonconformists. 2 2 : refusal to conform to an established or conventional creed, rule, or practice. 3 3 : absence of agreement or correspondence.\n[8] Nonconformity (quality) In quality management, a nonconformity (also known as a defect) is a deviation from a specification, a standard, or an expectation. Nonconformities are classified as either critical, major, or minor. In software engineering, ISO/IEC 9126 distinguishes between a defect and a nonconformity; a defect is the nonfulfilment of intended usage requirements, whereas a nonconformity is the nonfulfilment of a requirement. A similar distinction is made between validation and verification.\n[9] Definition of nonconformity. 1a : failure or refusal to conform to an established churchb often capitalized : the movement or principles of English Protestant dissentc often capitalized : the body of English Nonconformists. 2 : refusal to conform to an established or conventional creed, rule, or practice.\n[10] 1 archaic : lack of conformity. 2a : lack of continuity in deposition between rock strata in contact corresponding to a period of nondeposition, weathering, or erosionb : the surface of contact between unconformable strata.\n[11] Thanks for the A2A. An unconformity occurs when there is erosion of a layer or layers of deposited rock followed by the deposition of new sedimentary rock on top. It it called an unconformity because the ages of the layers of rock that are abutting each other are discontinuous at the unconformity.\n[12] The different types of unconformities include disconformity, nonconformity, angular unconformity, paraconformity, buttress unconformity, blended unconformity, and biconformity.1 person found this useful.he different types of unconformities include disconformity, nonconformity, angular unconformity, paraconformity, buttress unconformity, blended unconformity, and biconformity. 1 person found this useful.\n[13] They are surfaces of contact between older rocks and younger sedimentary rocks, formed due to erosion or lack of sediment deposition over extended periods of time.

These interfaces between discontinuous layers of rock are called unconformities. They complicate the task of relative dating, because they don't give an accurate picture of what happened in geologic history.\n[15] In part 1, I looked at the phenomenon of the Great Unconformity, a gap between Grand Canyon layers that spans more than a quarter of Earth's history. Though geologists understand how unconformities like this occur, creationists have a rather different view about what formed the Great Unconformity.\n[16] For geologists, one of the most famous angular unconformity is the Grand Unconformity in the Grand Canyon of Arizona. Here tilted sedimentary rocks of Precambrian age (lower half of photo) are overlain by younger sedimentary rocks of Phanerozoic age (Cambrian and younger, upper half of photo).onconformities are unconformities that separate igneous or metamorphic rocks from overlying sedimentary rocks.

Dunbar and Rodgers (1957)* defined an unconformity as a temporal break in a stratigraphic sequence resulting from a change in regimen that caused deposition to cease for a considerable span of time. It normally implies uplift and erosion with the loss of some of the previously formed record..\n[3] There are three types of unconformities: disconformity, nonconformity, and angular unconformity. Disconformity An unconformity between parallel layers of sedimentary rocks which represents a period of erosion or non-deposition.est Answer: An unconformity is a gap in time in rock layers, where erosion occurs while deposition slows or stops. The rocks above an unconformity are younger than the rocks beneath (unless the sequence has been overturned).\n[4] Basically both indicate a break in deposition, either by nondeposition or erosion. An unconformity describes this phenomena (break in the rock record: hiatus).

When igneous or metamorphic rocks are eroded and then covered by younger sedimentary rocks, the contact is called a nonconformity. One of the most famous of these is found in the Grand Canyon, where the oldest sedimentary rocks are more than a billion years younger than the 1.6 billion-year-old metamorphic rocks on which they rest.\n[6] unconformities are the record of major episodes of uplift, erosion and subsidence during the growth of the continents as earth history progressed. they are therefore important evidence for crustal mobility throughout earth history.\n[7] A ngular Unconformity Disconformity Nonconformity An angular unconformity, as its name suggests, is an unconformity between layers that are not parallel but instead are at an angle.

Steno's principle of lateral continuity\n[8] An unconformity is a surface in the rock record, in the stratigraphic column, representing a time from which no rocks are preserved. It could represent a time when no rocks were formed, or a time when rocks were formed but then eroded away. Small unconformities are ubiquitous in the rock record -- for instance, in the Coconino sandstone, every cross-bed surface represents a small unconformity. The Great Unconformity is important for three reasons: it represents a long span of time -- 250 to 1200 million years in the Grand Canyon;\n[9] 1 a lack of conformity; inconsistency; incongruity. 2 Geol. 3 a break in the continuity of rock strata in contact, separating younger from older rocks and usually resulting from erosion of the surface of the older bed before the younger bed was laid down. 4 the surface of contact between such strata.\n[10] An unconformity / discontinuity is a place from which some of the evidence is missing.

The disconformity surface represents a period of nondeposition and/or erosion (Figure 1. a). Try This Cross Section Interpretation Exercise\n[4] An unconformity is a widespread surface separating rocks above and below, which represents a gap in the rock record. Unconformities occur when either erosion wears away rocks, or rock deposits never form. Therefore, a time gap exists between when the rocks below the unconformity formed and when those above it formed.\n[5] The notion of the general incompleteness of the geologic record is an important one to keep in mind while interpreting Earth history from the rock record. Types of Unconformities. There are three principal types of unconformity, namely, the disconformity, the nonconformity, and the angular unconformity [Fig. 1]. The disconformity (alternately referred to as the paraconformity) is an erosional surface which exists between and parallel to layers of parallel strata.\n[6] A blended unconformity is a type of disconformity or nonconformity with no distinct separation plane or contact, sometimes consisting of soils, paleosols, or beds of pebbles derived from the underlying rock.\n[7] Definition of unconformity 1 a: lack of continuity in deposition between rock strata in contact corresponding to a period of nondeposition, weathering, or erosion b: the surface of contact between unconformable strata\n[8] Definition of UNCONFORMITY. 1. archaic: lack of conformity. 2. a: lack of continuity in deposition between rock strata in contact corresponding to a period of nondeposition, weathering, or erosion b: the surface of contact between unconformable strata.\n[9] Nonconformity When igneous or metamorphic rocks are eroded and then covered by younger sedimentary rocks, the contact is called a nonconformity.

Types of Unconformities. There are three principal types of unconformity, namely, the disconformity, the nonconformity, and the angular unconformity [Fig. 1]. The disconformity (alternately referred to as the paraconformity) is an erosional surface which exists between and parallel to layers of parallel strata.\n[14] The different types of unconformities include disconformity, nonconformity, angular unconformity, paraconformity, buttress unconformity, blended unconformity, and biconformity.1 person found this useful.he different types of unconformities include disconformity, nonconformity, angular unconformity, paraconformity, buttress unconformity, blended unconformity, and biconformity. 1 person found this useful.\n[15] Basically both indicate a break in deposition, either by nondeposition or erosion.

Clara cells are nonciliated, and they secrete surfactant, like the type II alveolar epithelial cells found deeper in the bronchial tree.\n[3] The inner surface of the trachea is linning by a pseudostratified columnar ciliated epithelium. In between these ciliated cells some globet cells can be seen. Underneath this layer there is a fine layer of dense connective tissue (Lamina propria), and another layer of loose connective tissue (Submucosa).\n[4] Their action can be restored by the addition of mucus. In bronchi, the C-shaped cartilage of the trachea is replaced by separate plates of cartilage. At the same time, the lamina propria becomes surrounded by a band of smooth muscle fibres which are arranged spirally and criss-cross one another.\n[5] This helps to keep the lungs free of particles and bacteria. 1 show labels.

The trachea is a wide flexible tube, the lumen of which is kept open by 20 tracheal cartilages, which are C-shaped rings of hyaline cartilage. The gaps between the rings of cartilage are filled by the trachealis muscle-a bundle of smooth muscle, and fibroelastic tissue.he epithelium is either columnar or cuboidal. The final branches of the bronchioles are called terminal bronchioles. These have a layer smooth muscle surrounding their lumens. Stimulation of the vagus nerve (parasympathetic) causes the smooth muscle to contract, and reduce the diameter of the terminal bronchioles.\n[4] , Researcher !! The lungs tissues are made up mainly of squamous epithelial tissue (called alveolar epithelium in the lungs). This type of tissue serves a critical function within the lungs because it allows the transfer and exchange of gases with little or no resistance. The advantages are a short distance between the Oxygen in the alveoli and the blood in the capillaries.The lungs also contain ciliated epithelium.\n[5] The cartilage and mucous membrane of the primary bronchi are similar to that in the trachea. As the branching continues through the bronchial tree, the amount of hyaline cartilage in the walls decreases until it is absent in the smallest bronchioles.he two lungs, which contain all the components of the bronchial tree beyond the primary bronchi, occupy most of the space in the thoracic cavity. The lungs are soft and spongy because they are mostly air spaces surrounded by the alveolar cells and elastic connective tissue.\n[6] This bronchiole gets subdivided into respiratory bronchioles which comprise of only a few alveoli. Simple cuboidal epithelium, comprising of Clara cells, line the Terminal bronchioles.\n[7] Histological organization becomes more simplified from the smaller bronchi and bronchioles toward the respiratory portion. the Mucosa of the Upper Respiratory tract remains Pseudostratified columnar ciliated epithelium througout the beginning. The Columnar ciliated cells then gradually Decrease in height and Change to other cell type.\n[8] This slide showing a cross section of the mammalian trachea (wind pipe) contains examples of several different kinds of tissues. Supporting the trachea is a ring of connective tissue called hyaline cartilage. The chondrocytes (cartilage cells) that secrete this supporting matrix are located in spaces called lacunae.ntroduction to histology (Part 3). Nervous tissue is specialized for the reception of stimuli and conduction of nerve impulses. The tissue is composed of nerve cells (neurons), each of which is made up of a cell body and cell processes that carry impulses toward (dendrites) or away from (axons) the cell body.\n[9] A: Hyaline Cartilage on the periphery is part of the cartilagenous plates that do not enter into the lung. B: Bronchioles carry air from the bronchi to the terminal bronchioles and are line by ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium C: Terminal bronchioles are lined by ciliated simple columnar epithelium.: Terminal Bronchioles open up into alveoli allowing the air to pass directly into the alveolar spaces and diffuse across the simple squamous epitheliums of the alveoli and capillaries C: Alveolus is lined by a thin layer of simple squamous to facilitate diffusion of O2 and CO2.

The type III cell has two distinctive features that are not present in other lung epithelial cells: a microvillous brush border and bundles of fine filaments. Regarding its topography, the cell appears to have a preferential although variable localization in different species.\n[6] The bronchi themselves branch many times into smaller airways, ending in the narrowest airways (bronchioles), which are as small as one half of a millimeter across.

Smaller airways are supported by the lung tissue that surrounds and is attached to them.\n[6] A smooth muscle layer surrounds the respiratory epithelium, a type of moist, ciliated tissue lining the tertiary ... Click to read more below. The lungs' tertiary bronchi are also called the segmental bronchi.\n[7] The epithelium starts as a simple ciliated columnar epithelium and changes to simple ciliated cuboidal epithelium as the bronchioles decreases in size. The diameter of the bronchioles is often said to be less than 1 mm, though this value can actually range from 5 mm to 0.3 mm. As stated, these bronchioles do not have hyaline cartilage to maintain their patency. Instead, they rely on elastic fibers attached to the surrounding lung tissue for support.\n[8] In particular, one should be familiar with the four basic tissue types, most especially epithelium and connective tissue and with the basic tools of histology. Overview of Respiratory Tract Histology. The lung is one of several organs that packs a large epithelial surface area into a compact volume.he squamous epithelial cells of the alveolar walls are sometimes called Type I pneumocytes. As noted above, these squamous Type I cells facilitate gas exchange. Scattered among the squamous cells are occasional larger cuboidal cells, sometimes called greater alveolar cells and sometimes called Type II pneumocytes.\n[9] The supporting lamina propria underneath the epithelium contains elastin, that plays a role in the elastic recoil of the trachea during inspiration and expiration, together with blood vessels that warm the air. The sub-mucosa contains glands which are mixed sero-mucous glands.he epithelium is either columnar or cuboidal. The final branches of the bronchioles are called terminal bronchioles. These have a layer smooth muscle surrounding their lumens. Stimulation of the vagus nerve (parasympathetic) causes the smooth muscle to contract, and reduce the diameter of the terminal bronchioles.\n[10] The histological structure of the epithelium and the underlying connective tissue of the bronchi corresponds largely to that of the trachea and the main bronchi. In addition, bronchi are surrounded by a layer of smooth muscle, which is located between the cartilage and epithelium.he histological structure of the epithelium and the underlying connective tissue of the bronchi corresponds largely to that of the trachea and the main bronchi. In addition, bronchi are surrounded by a layer of smooth muscle, which is located between the cartilage and epithelium.\n[11] A pulmonary lobule is the portion of the lung ventilated by one bronchiole. Bronchioles are approximately 1mm or less in diameter and their walls consist of ciliated cuboidal epithelium and a layer of smooth muscle. Bronchioles divide into even smaller bronchioles, called terminal, which are 0.5mm or less in diameter.he diameter of the bronchioles is often said to be less than 1 mm, though this value can actually range from 5 mm to 0.3 mm. As stated, these bronchioles do not have hyaline cartilage to maintain their patency. Instead, they rely on elastic fibers attached to the surrounding lung tissue for support.\n[12] They are branches of the bronchi, and are part of the conducting zone of the respiratory system. The bronchioles divide further into smaller terminal bronchioles which are still in the conducting zone and these then divide into the smaller respiratory bronchioles which mark the beginning of the respiratory region.he diameter of the bronchioles is often said to be less than 1 mm, though this value can actually range from 5 mm to 0.3 mm. As stated, these bronchioles do not have hyaline cartilage to maintain their patency. Instead, they rely on elastic fibers attached to the surrounding lung tissue for support.\n[13] It divides into two principle bronchi, tubes which conduct air into the lungs, and they divide into two lobar bronchi for the left lung, and into four lobar bronchi for the right lung. These further divide into smaller bronchi and bronchioles within the lung tissue. The structure of the larger bronchi is identical to that of the trachea. On the smaller bronchi the C-shaped cartilage rings are gradually replaced by irregular plaques of cartilage. Bronchioles have no cartilage at all. The bronchioles are less than 1mm in diameter, and undergo further divisions, the last of which is characterised by the loss of goblet cells.\n[14] The bronchioles or bronchioli are the passageways by which air passes through the nose or mouth to the alveoli (air sacs) of the lungs, in which branches no longer contain cartilage or glands in their submucosa.he diameter of the bronchioles is often said to be less than 1 mm, though this value can actually range from 5 mm to 0.3 mm. As stated, these bronchioles do not have hyaline cartilage to maintain their patency. Instead, they rely on elastic fibers attached to the surrounding lung tissue for support.\n[15] They are branches of the bronchi, and are part of the conducting zone of the respiratory system.

Bronchioles are approximately 1mm or less in diameter and their walls consist of ciliated cuboidal epithelium and a layer of smooth muscle. Bronchioles divide into even smaller bronchioles, called terminal, which are 0.5mm or less in diameter.\n[16] Bronchioles are the terminal segments of the conductive portion. At the transition from bronchi to bronchioles the epithelium changes to a ciliated columnar epithelium, but most of the cell types found in the epithelium of other parts of the conductive portion are still present.ronchioles are the terminal segments of the conductive portion. At the transition from bronchi to bronchioles the epithelium changes to a ciliated columnar epithelium, but most of the cell types found in the epithelium of other parts of the conductive portion are still present.\n[17] The epithelium of the terminal bronchioles is composed of three types of cells-ciliated cells, nonciliated cells and a few basal cells.The epithelium of the respiratory bronchioles has three cell populations.The first near the terminal bronchioles consists of the nonciliated columnar, ciliated columnar and basal cells. The second consists of nonciliated cuboidal cells. The third is most similar to the alveolar epithelial lining.These are nonciliated cells, cuboidal type II cells, and squamous type I cells.he epithelium of the respiratory bronchioles has three cell populations. The first near the terminal bronchioles consists of the nonciliated columnar, ciliated columnar and basal cells. The second consists of nonciliated cuboidal cells.\n[18] The terminal bronchiole is the most distal segment of the conducting zone. It branches off the lesser bronchioles. Each of the terminal bronchioles divides to form respiratory bronchioles which contain a small number of alveoli. Terminal bronchioles are lined with simple cuboidal epithelium containing club cells. Terminal bronchioles contain a limited number of ciliated cells and no goblet cells. Club cells are non-ciliated, rounded protein secreting cells. Their secretions are a nonsticky, proteinaceous compound to maintain the airway in the smallest bronchioles.\n[19] In addition to defense, the Clara cells help the terminal bronchiole to remain open as air passes through it. They release a type of substance known as a surfactant, which decreases the tension of the epithelial lining of the bronchiole. this makes expansion of the airway possible as air is inhaled.\n[20] The epithelium is either columnar or cuboidal. The final branches of the bronchioles are called terminal bronchioles. These have a layer smooth muscle surrounding their lumens. Stimulation of the vagus nerve (parasympathetic) causes the smooth muscle to contract, and reduce the diameter of the terminal bronchioles.\nSearch Query: what type of tissue are bronchioles.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

In a hip replacement or resurfacing operation, the surgeon replaces the damaged surfaces with artificial parts, which may be made of metal, plastic or ceramic materials.\n[8] Font Size. A. A. A. Hip replacement surgery is a procedure in which a doctor surgically removes a painful hip joint with arthritis and replaces it with an artificial joint often made from metal and plastic components. It usually is done when all other treatment options have failed to provide adequate pain relief.\n[9] This search took him into the field of polymers and his first attempt at hip arthroplasty in the early 1950's was a Teflon on Teflon bearing used as a resurfacing for the arthritic femoral head and acetabulum.\n[10] (Left) In the x-ray of a hip resurfacing taken from the front, a metal cap now covers the femoral head, and a small stem is seen in the femoral neck. A metal socket is also in place. Unlike the traditional total hip replacement shown on the right, the femoral head and neck are not removed.\n[11] You had a hip joint replacement surgery to replace all or part of your hip joint with an artificial joint. This artificial joint is called a prosthesis.\n[12] A. Hip replacement surgery is a procedure in which a doctor surgically removes a painful hip joint with arthritis and replaces it with an artificial joint often made from metal and plastic components.It usually is done when all other treatment options have failed to provide adequate pain relief.. Hip replacement surgery is a procedure in which a doctor surgically removes a painful hip joint with arthritis and replaces it with an artificial joint often made from metal and plastic components.\n[13] A new stem cell technique could make hip replacements \"a thing of the past\" for some patients, says The Independent. Traditionally, people whose hip joint becomes worn or damaged over time need a mechanical implant fitted in place of their damaged joint. However, scientists are currently working on ways to repair the bone using stem cells.\n[14] A total knee replacement implant. 1 The lower end of the femur. The metal femoral component curves around the end of the femur (thighbone). 2 The top surface of the tibia. The tibial component is typically a flat metal platform with a cushion of strong, durable plastic, called polyethylene. 3 The back surface of the patella.\n[15] A. A. A.

Hip replacement surgery is a procedure in which a doctor surgically removes a painful hip joint with arthritis and replaces it with an artificial joint often made from metal and plastic components.\n[16] A hip hemiarthroplasty is similar to a hip replacement but only one half of the hip joint is replaced. In a hip hemiarthroplasty the top of the thigh bone (femur) is replaced by a metal implant. The hip joint is a ball and socket joint. The socket is formed by a cup in the pelvis, known as the acetabulum. The ball of the joint is formed by the head of the thigh bone (femur).\n[17] If you determine that an MRI of a metal-on-metal hip implant patient is appropriate, the FDA recommends the following: 1 Consult with the radiologist to evaluate the benefits and risks of utilizing MRI with metal artifact reduction; 2 Review the available device-specific labeling from manufacturers for MRI Conditions; and.\n[18] If you underwent hip replacement surgery, watch for these signs and symptoms that could be associated with implant failure. Warning Signs of Defective Implants If you have a metal on metal hip implant, it's recommended to periodically visit your doctor or orthopedic surgeon for follow up exams and x-rays.\n[19] If you underwent hip replacement surgery, watch for these signs and symptoms that could be associated with implant failure. Warning Signs of Defective Implants. If you have a metal on metal hip implant, it's recommended to periodically visit your doctor or orthopedic surgeon for follow up exams and x-rays.\n[20] Modern hip replacements should last for 20 years in 8 out of 10 patients. In more active patients the joints may wear out more quickly. It's usually possible to have further hip replacements if necessary, although the results may not be quite as good as with your first hip replacement.\nSearch Query: what metal are hip replacements made of.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

We are fortunate that modern implant materials have significantly reduced wear rates. These new materials have dramatically increased the life span of today's total hip replacements.\n[2] In a traditional total hip replacement, the head of the thighbone (femoral head) and the damaged socket (acetabulum) are both removed and replaced with metal, plastic, or ceramic components. In hip resurfacing, the femoral head is not removed, but is instead trimmed and capped with a smooth metal covering.\n[3] Since the introduction of the low-friction total hip arthroplasty (THA) by Sir John Charnley,wear has been a primary issue in hip arthroplasty. Charnley's original choice for bearing surfaces was a stainless-steel head on polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE).\n[4] Based on the successful use of ceramic components in hip replacement, one manufacturer has developed a ceramic implant for the knee. The patient's size, weight, and gender also have a bearing on implant selection. While once there were only a few sizes available, surgeons now have a wider selection to choose from.\n[5] Three different case studies of cobalt toxicity after hip replacement surgery were presented within 10 days of each other in early 2014. The remarkable nature of these case studies is that \"hip pain was not a prominent feature,\" Dr. Bunning says. The patients did present with similar symptoms, and all were found to have excessively high serum cobalt levels. Two of the cases involved metal-on-polyethylene implants, and one involved a metal-on-metal implant.\n[6] Symptoms of Hip Implant Failures A properly functioning hip replacement should last between 10 to 20 years, but there is still a chance that your hip replacement could fail. In Minnesota, the risk for metal on metal hip implant failure is even higher.\n[7] Uses of Medical Titanium. Most all of us know someone who has required orthopedic surgery to replace a failing hip socket, shoulder joint or severely broken bone. It's very likely medical grade titanium was the material of choice for the surgeons when reconstructing these parts of the body.\n[8] These terms refer to the portion of the replacement that is attached to the tibia. When fixed-bearing implants are used, a metal component is inserted into the tibia and a polyethylene (plastic) tray is locked into place on top of it.ip and Knee Implants With a history of excellent surgical technique and outcomes, the focus of new development in this area is on the use of enabling technology to improve preparation and component positioning in hip and knee replacement surgery.\n[9] Titanium biocompatibility: Because it is biocompatible (it is non-toxic and is not rejected by the body), titanium has many medical uses, including surgical implements and implants, such as hip balls and sockets (joint replacement) that can stay in place for up to 20 years.t is a lustrous transition metal with a silver color, low density and high strength. It is highly resistant to corrosion in sea water, aqua regia and chlorine. Titanium was discovered in Cornwall, Great Britain, by William Gregor in 1791 and named by Martin Heinrich Klaproth for the Titans of Greek mythology.\n[10] The implant for a total knee replacement is composed of 4 parts: the tibial and femoral components, a plastic insert, and the patella. The tibial and femoral components are made out of metal, usually cobalt-chrome, and are used to cap the ends of the femur and tibia after the arthritic bone is removed.\n[11] A.

If you have had a MoM hip replacement and you develop symptoms of metallic taste in your mouth I recommend you see your primary or orthopedic physician.\n[2] Total Hip Replacement. Stem Type with Acrylic Cement Fixation. In 1962, Sir John Charnley used a small (22 mm) stainless steel ball on a stem which was inserted into the bone to replace the femoral (ball) side of the joint and a high density plastic socket to replace the acetabular (socket) side.\n[3] Even hip replacements made with special materials designed to last a long time do not last forever. The good news is that studies show that common types of hip replacements can last more than 20 years. While there are hundreds of studies, they all vary in the type of implant used and the type of patient who had their hip replaced.\n[4] During the procedure, the surgeon makes an incision into the hip, removes the damaged joint and replaces it with an artificial joint made of metal alloy or ceramic. A modern artificial hip joint should last the patient for at least 15 years. How much does a hip replacement cost and what's the recovery time? A hip replacement may be offered for free on the NHS is the patient's case is deemed severe enough.\n[5] Stryker is a market leader in hip and knee orthopedic devices with over 1 million implant devices sold. Experts have now warned that metal-on-metal implants pose severe health risks to patients like device fracture, dislocation, corrosion, fretting and metallic poisoning.\n[6] OOF Abstract The incidence of metallosis after metal-on-metal hip resurfacing varies, yet may not be as common as feared. Metallosis can also result from metal-on-metal total hip replacement. The reasons patients develop metallosis are multifactorial, involving the interaction of patient, surgical, and implant factors.\n[7] Based on the successful use of ceramic components in hip replacement, one manufacturer has developed a ceramic implant for the knee. However, Dr. Windsor notes, we won't know for quite a while if this will offer any advantage in the knee, which is a very different kind of joint..\n[8] Causes of Failure in Biomet Hip Implants One way an artificial hip begins to fail or loosen is that the metal parts comprising the implant rub against each other and cause small particles of metal debris to shed from the implant and inflame surrounding bone and soft tissue.\n[9] Need for second hip replacement. Your prosthetic hip joint may wear out eventually, so if you have hip replacement surgery when you're relatively young and active, you eventually may need a second hip replacement. However, new materials are making implants last longer, so a second replacement may not be needed. Metal-on-metal complications\n[10] Total Hip Replacement. Stem Type without Cement Fixation.

In the 1960's and 1970's, a number of materials were tried as bearing surfaces in joint arthroplasty, including Teflon\u00ae and metallic alloys such as stainless steel and cobalt-chromium alloy.\n[2] Some patients with a metal-on-metal hip implant may have elevated metal ion levels (e.g. cobalt and/or chromium) in their bloodstream. Several factors can impact the accuracy, reproducibility, and clinical interpretation of metal ion test results.\n[3] Stryker has produced metal-on-metal (MoM) hip implants that do not function as they should, leading to massive recalls and lawsuits. In the fall of 2014, Stryker agreed to pay $1.43 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits concerning its ABG II and Rejuvenate hip stems.\n[4] With hip replacement, an acetabular cup usually includes a metal shell and a plastic, metal, or ceramic liner to replace the acetabulum. The femoral stem is inserted inside the femur, and the femoral head (or ball) fits inside the acetabulum.\n[5] Recently, cobalt poisoning has been seen from the wear and tear of some cobalt/chromium metal-on-metal hip implants. This type of implant is an artificial hip socket that is created by fitting a metal ball into a metal cup.\n[6] Trunnionosis, Metallosis, and Their Effects. What is Trunnionosis? Hip replacements, specifically of the metal-on-metal variety, are composed of several parts, including the ball, the stem, and the prosthesis. In the majority of hip replacements that are produced today, the prosthesis rests on top of the ball.\n[7] 1 Total metal-on-metal implants where the replacement ball is less than 36mm wide. 2 A particular range of hip replacements called DePuy ASR \u2013 these hip replacements were recalled by their manufacturer, DePuy, in 2010 because of high failure rates. 3 The company made three types of ASR implant.\n[8] With hip replacement, an acetabular cup usually includes a metal shell and a plastic, metal, or ceramic liner to replace the acetabulum. The femoral stem is inserted inside the femur, and the femoral head (or ball) fits inside the acetabulum. Once the three components are aligned, more natural movement may be restored.\n[9] For women of child-bearing age there is a theoretical concern that metal-on-metal resurfacing creates metal ions that could affect a baby's development in the womb.

Titanium is a light metal but very strong, e.g. it is as strong as steel but 45% lighter. For these properties it is used to make lightweight alloys for aircraft, bikes and laptop computers.The compound Titanium dioxide (TiO 2) absorbs UV light and is used in sunscreen.itanium is resistant to corrosion by sea water and therefore is used on parts of ships. The non-reactive properties of titanium make it ideal for use in the body as hip replacements and pacemakers, which won't be attacked by body fluids.\n[3] Certain manufacturers of the metal-on-metal hip implants have agreed to pay out billions in settlements on hip recall lawsuits to those who have suffered as a result of defective hip products.

TheLawFirm.com has clients enrolled in these settlement programs and know how to navigate the complex rules and requirements of qualifying our hip revision recall clients for compensation.\n[4] Metallosis. Metallosis happens when the parts of a hip implant rub together and release microscopic metal debris into your body. When these tiny metal pieces absorb into your bloodstream, they can travel throughout your body and cause severe reactions that at first don't seem related to your hip implant. ALVAL\n[5] Stryker Orthopaedics has produced several metal-on-metal (MoM) hip implants that do not function as they should, leading to massive recalls and lawsuits. Stryker is the manufacturer behind the Rejuvenate and ABG II hip stems, both of which were recalled.\n[6] People can be exposed to high levels of metal through their environment and diet. Unapproved or counterfeit medications and natural remedies may also contain aluminum, mercury, lead or uranium. But people can also get metal poisoning from metal-on-metal hip or knee replacements.\n[7] During revision surgery, the surgeon may need to remove or exchange one or more parts of the hip replacement. The parts that are not attached to the bone can be safely exchanged with minimal to no removal of the patient's bone. However, if the metallic parts in contact with the bone need to be changed, some bone loss generally occurs.\n[8] Hip Replacement Surgery. Guide. Total joint replacement involves surgery to replace the ends of both bones in a damaged joint to create new joint surfaces. Total hip replacement surgery uses metal, ceramic, or plastic parts to replace the ball at the upper end of the thighbone (femur) and resurface the hip socket in the pelvic bone. Total hip replacement surgery replaces damaged cartilage with new joint material in a step-by-step process . Doctors may attach replacement joints to the bones with or without cement. Cemented joints are attached to the existing bone with cement, which acts as a glue and attaches the artificial joint to the bone.\n[9] Additional information for patients with a metal-on-metal hip can be found in Patients who have a Metal-on-Metal Hip Implant. FDA Activities: The FDA is committed to providing reliable safety recommendations to patients and health care providers about the utilization of these devices.\n[10] In a total hip replacement surgery, doctors replace the diseased or damaged hip with an implant consisting of a stem, ball, liner, and socket. 1 The stem, made of metal, is inserted into the femur (thigh bone) and anchors the implant in place. 2 The ball is attached to the top of the stem.\n[11] A.

In the majority of hip replacements that are produced today, the prosthesis rests on top of the ball.\n[16] 1 Total metal-on-metal implants where the replacement ball is less than 36mm wide. 2 A particular range of hip replacements called DePuy ASR \u2013 these hip replacements were recalled by their manufacturer, DePuy, in 2010 because of high failure rates. 3 The company made three types of ASR implant.\n[17] For women of child-bearing age there is a theoretical concern that metal-on-metal resurfacing creates metal ions that could affect a baby's development in the womb. Total Hip Replacement. When the dysplasia is more severe, or the patient is older, then a traditional total hip replacement is usually performed.\n[18] In a traditional total hip replacement, the head of the thighbone (femoral head) and the damaged socket (acetabulum) are both removed and replaced with metal, plastic, or ceramic components. In hip resurfacing, the femoral head is not removed, but is instead trimmed and capped with a smooth metal covering.\n[19] The goal of replacement surgery is to relieve pain and restore mobility and function of the damaged hip joint. In a total hip replacement (ICD-9-CM code 81.51), the femoral head is removed and replaced with a metal stem, which is placed into the center of the femur, and a metal or ceramic ball.or the qualifier (character 7), the choices include cemented, uncemented, or no qualifier. For example, a left total hip arthroplasty using a cemented stem and a metal-on-plastic articulating surface is classified to code 0SRB029.\n[20] Arthritis damages the cartilage-covered surfaces of the joint so the ball moves less smoothly and less freely within the socket. In a hip replacement or resurfacing operation, the surgeon replaces the damaged surfaces with artificial parts, which may be made of metal, plastic or ceramic materials.\nSearch Query: what metal are hip replacements made of.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

It is twice as strong as aluminium. It is nearly as resistant to corrosion as platinum. Titanium is a component of joint replacement parts, including hip ball and sockets. These may last for 20 years or so.\n[4] During hip replacement, a surgeon removes the damaged sections of your hip joint and replaces them with parts usually constructed of metal, ceramic and very hard plastic. This artificial joint (prosthesis) helps reduce pain and improve function.\n[5] It is also possible, for some patients, to change the bearing surface to metal-on-polyethylene. Total hip replace-ment is an alternative for patients whose resurfacing procedure is complicated by metallosis. Advanced cases may present additional challenges; thus, early surgery is recommended.\n[6] Materials as diverse as ivory, wood, rubber, acrylic, and Bakelite have been used in the manufacture of prosthetic implants. The extensive use in modern times of metallic alloys is related to the availability and success at the beginning of the 20th century of several different alloys made of the noble metals. Implants made from iron, cobalt, chromium, titanium, and tantalum are commonly used. Clinical studies have demonstrated that alloys made from these metals can be used safely and effectively in the manufacturing of orthopedic implants that are left in vivo for extended periods. The mechanical, biologic, and physical properties of these materials play significant roles in the longevity of these implants.\n[7] 3 Responses to When to Have Hip Revision Surgery Due to Metal-on-Metal Prostheses. 1 Hi Margaret, The ML taper is a titanium non modular stem. If indeed you are developing an adverse local tissue response, it very well may be from taper corrosion.\n[8] Stryker Orthopaedics has produced several metal-on-metal (MoM) hip implants that do not function as they should, leading to recalls, revision surgeries, and lawsuits. Description: Metal-on-metal (MoM) hip implants can release metal particles into the blood, poisoning the patient.\n[9] of metal-on-plastic and 2.3% of ceramic-on-ceramic hip implants. Furthermore, larger, rather than lower, femoral head sizes in met-al-on-metal hip resurfacing articulations in-crease implant failure rates, with each 1-mm increase in head size of metal-on-metal hip implants being associated with a 2% increase in failure.\n[10] Metallosis Metallosis happens when the parts of a hip implant rub together and release microscopic metal debris into your body. When these tiny metal pieces absorb into your bloodstream, they can travel throughout your body and cause severe reactions that at first don't seem related to your hip implant.\n[11] Titanium is used to make hip replacements. Titanium is a light metal but very strong, e.g. it is as strong as steel but 45% lighter. For these properties it is used to make lightweight alloys for aircraft, bikes and laptop computers.The compound Titanium dioxide (TiO 2) absorbs UV light and is used in sunscreen.itanium is resistant to corrosion by sea water and therefore is used on parts of ships. The non-reactive properties of titanium make it ideal for use in the body as hip replacements and pacemakers, which won't be attacked by body fluids.\n[12] In a total hip replacement surgery, doctors replace the diseased or damaged hip with an implant consisting of a stem, ball, liner, and socket. 1 The stem, made of metal, is inserted into the femur (thigh bone) and anchors the implant in place. 2 The ball is attached to the top of the stem.\n[13] A.

Artificial hip joints\u2014called prostheses\u2014come in several versions, such as metal on polyethylene, ceramic on polyethylene or ceramic on ceramic.\n[4] Some prosthesis, like hip and knee joints made of cobalt chrome, contain some trace of nickel and for patients with allergies to this may have to go with Titanium joints.\n[5] The metals used in artificial knees are alloys of cobalt-chromium and titanium. The bearing portion of the joint is made of a high-grade, wear-resistant plastic. The metal-plastic bearing combination is the most common type used in knee replacement implants worldwide.\n[6] Revision surgery rates are higher with metal-on-metal implants because they have a tendency to fail sooner and cause more complications. For example, the average failure rate is 1 percent after a year and 5 percent at five years for most hip implants made of metal and plastic or ceramic and plastic.\n[7] Wear Particles. If for some reason I would need a hip replacement, my single biggest concern would be wear particles. This phenomenon first came to light about 5 \u2013 7 years ago when surgeons began to replace the first worn out or failed metal on metal (MOM) hips. What they found in some patients was scary.\n[8] On the socket (pelvic) side of a hip replacement or resurfacing, a metal half-shell is fitted inside the patient's own bony socket. Inside this shell, a locking mechanism fastens the bearing, which can be polyethylene, metal, or ceramic.\n[9] Every hip implant has a distinct set of benefits and risks. The key design features of each implant including size, material and dimensions make each system unique. In addition, the same hip implant system will have different outcomes in different patients. It is also important to recognize that hip implants may need to be replaced eventually. Factors that influence the longevity of the device include the patient's age, sex, weight, diagnosis, activity level, conditions of the surgery, and the type of implant chosen. In the United States, there are currently five types of total hip replacement devices available with different bearing surfaces.

Hare are brief descriptions of some of the most commonly used hip replacement implants. Not all implants are options for all patients. A prosthetic made of metal and plastic are the most commonly used hip replacement implants. Both the ball and the socket of the hip joint are replaced with a metal implant, and a plastic spacer is placed in between. The most commonly used metals used include titanium and stainless steel.\n[6] 1 metal-on-metal hip resurfacing implants \u2013 where the socket and ball of the hip bone has a metal surface applied to it rather than being totally replaced. 2 Total metal-on-metal implants where the replacement ball is less than 36mm wide.\n[7] The most common is Ti-6 aluminum Ti-4 vanadium (Ti6Al4V), but other more modern alloys are coming into use. Because of the lower moduli of elasticity than cobalt-based alloys or surgical stainless steel, titanium-based alloys have not been found to be as reliable a material when used as a cemented hip replacement.\n[8] Hip Replacement Implant Materials. There are a large number of hip implant devices on the market. These category names reference the materials used for the implant bearings. The stem and ball fit into and articulate against the cup or acetabulum. Each component can be made of one of several materials. There is no consensus in the orthopedic community regarding the single \"best\" bearing or material.\n[9] Other panels may include one or more additional metals, such as cadmium, copper, or zinc. For hip replacement monitoring, the panel includes chromium and cobalt. A doctor will select which metals to test for based upon what a person may have been exposed to in addition to clinical symptoms. The term heavy metals is loosely defined.\n[10] Titanium is a component of joint replacement parts, including hip ball and sockets. These may last for 20 years or so.

Hip replacement devices break into a few big categories: Metal on Metal (MOM) \u2013 These are what they sound like. Both the socket and the ball are made of stainless steel, titanium, chromium, cobalt or some combination of these.\n[2] Metal and Plastic Implants.

Ceramic hip replacement implants also use metal parts that fit within the bone, but the bearing surface (the ball and the socket) can be made of the ceramic material. Ceramic hip implants are designed to be the most resistant to wear of all available hip replacement implants.\n[6] Implants may be made of a variety of materials including metal (usually titanium), ceramic or polyethylene (a type of hard plastic). Ongoing research and enabling technology will determine new directions in materials used in hip replacement surgery.\n[7] All hip resurfacing operations use a metal-on-metal bearing hip. Most total hip replacements are not metal-on-metal bearings and use other materials including ceramic and high density polyethylene. Your hospital will always have a record of your operation and what implants were used.\n[8] As a result, some of these implants have been recalled. Implants may be made of a variety of materials including metal (usually titanium), ceramic or polyethylene (a type of hard plastic). Ongoing research and enabling technology will determine new directions in materials used in hip replacement surgery.\n[9] In metal-on-metal devices both the ball and socket components are made of metal. These metal implants have been used in total hip replacement surgeries and hip resurfacing procedures. Because of metal's durability, metal-on-metal devices were expected to last longer than other hip implants.\n[10] The implant for a total hip replacement is composed of 3 parts: the stem, the ball, and the socket. The stem is made out of metal, usually cobalt-chrome or titanium, and is placed within the native thighbone. The ball is usually made out of polished metal or ceramic, and fits on top of the stem.\n[11] Hip replacements are among the most common orthopedic procedures.

In the majority of hip replacements that are produced today, the prosthesis rests on top of the ball.\n[18] 1 metal-on-metal hip resurfacing implants \u2013 where the socket and ball of the hip bone has a metal surface applied to it rather than being totally replaced. 2 Total metal-on-metal implants where the replacement ball is less than 36mm wide.\n[19] For women of child-bearing age there is a theoretical concern that metal-on-metal resurfacing creates metal ions that could affect a baby's development in the womb. Total Hip Replacement. When the dysplasia is more severe, or the patient is older, then a traditional total hip replacement is usually performed.\n[20] Not all pains and problems are due to your body's reaction to metal debris. Other causes of pain that can affect all types of hip replacement include loosening, wear and infection. If there's damage to your hip then you'll need revision surgery in which the metal-on-metal implants will be removed and new ones inserted.\nSearch Query: what metal are hip replacements made of.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Attribute charts are used for plotting and controlling countable qualities( eg number of defects) . As we can't have a negative number of defects for controlling so we simply take the lower limit as 0. That means we have to control the process with least of 0 defects.\n[2] A Pie Chart is a circular chart which is divided into sectors in which the area of each sector represents the size of the data.\n[3] A pie chart displays data, information, and statistics in an easy-to-read 'pie-slice' format with varying slice sizes telling you how much of one data element exists. The bigger the slice, the more of that particular data was gathered. Let's take, for example, the pie chart shown below.\n[4] Now that we have both visual and statistical evidence that one set of data is approximately normally distributed and one is not, we will proceed to see how the different data sets behave in a variable control chart.

I found a simple example in the Bain and Company 2012 Global Private Equity Report. They had a Marimekko chart that presented private equity investments in emerging markets. The main takeaway from the chart is that China, India and Brazil dominate the other emerging markets with respect to private equity investments.

The seller may value the car at $10,000, while the buyer is willing to pay $15,000 for it. A deal in which the car is sold for $12,500 would be Pareto efficient because both the seller and the buyer are better off as a result of the trade. In this case, they are better off by the same amount: $2,500. However, any price between $10,000 and $15,000 is Pareto efficient because the seller receives more value in money than the value he places on the car, and the buyer values the car more than the money he pays for it. Pareto efficiency has applications in game theory, multicriteria decisionmaking, engineering, and many of the social sciences. It is a central principle in economics. In general, an economic allocation problem has several possible Pareto efficient outcomes. In the marketplace, the competitive equilibrium is typically included among them.\n[2] Statisticians use two-way tables and segmented bar charts to examine the relationship between two categorical variables. Entries in the cells of a two-way table can be displayed as frequency counts or as relative frequencies (just like a one-way table).\n[3] Pie charts are often used to explain budgets, taxation issues or other financial matters. For example, if someone wants to make a pie graph of the family budget, the total amount of money earned is represented by the chart as a whole. The pieces of the chart represent the different ways the family's earnings are spent.\n[4] Graphs (pie, line, and bar) - any visual representation of statistical data. Not mandatory but if you choose to make statistical visual, your choices are one of three graphs: * Pie Graphs-- Show how one variable relates to the whole; what one portion one slice is to the whole.\n[5] According to Pareto efficiency, however, any allocation of the $100 would be optimal \u2014 including the distribution you would likely prefer: keeping all $100 for yourself. Pareto efficiency says that an allocation is efficient if an action makes some individual better off and no individual worse off. The concept was developed by Vilfredo Pareto, an\n[6] A pie chart showing the composition of the 38th Parliament of Canada.

By the numbers it means that 80 percent of your outcomes come from 20 percent of your inputs. As Pareto demonstrated with his research this \"rule\" holds true, in a very rough sense, to an 80/20 ratio, however in many cases the ratio can be a lot higher \u2013 99/1 may be closer to reality.\n[5] Thus an alternative allocation is considered to be a Pareto improvement only if the alternative allocation is strictly preferred by all individuals.

The Histogram chart shows the distribution of your data and groups them into bins, which are groupings of data points within a given range. To show in an example, imagine we run a small bookstore and have a list of our entire selection of books and prices. The Histogram, Pareto and Box and Whisker charts can be easily inserted using the new Statistical Chart button in the Insert tab on the ribbon. The Histogram chart is the first option listed.

Consider another example: the sale of a used car. The seller may value the car at $10,000, while the buyer is willing to pay $15,000 for it. A deal in which the car is sold for $12,500 would be Pareto efficient because both the seller and the buyer are better off as a result of the trade. In this case, they are better off by the same amount: $2,500. However, any price between $10,000 and $15,000 is Pareto efficient because the seller receives more value in money than the value he places on the car, and the buyer values the car more than the money he pays for it. Pareto efficiency has applications in game theory, multicriteria decisionmaking, engineering, and many of the social sciences. It is a central principle in economics.

The Pareto principle is only tangentially related to Pareto efficiency.\n[6] More generally, the Pareto Principle is the observation (not law) that most things in life are not distributed evenly. It can mean all of the following things: 20% of the input creates 80% of the result. 20% of the workers produce 80% of the result. 20% of the customers create 80% of the revenue.\n[7] Visualize statistics with Histogram, Pareto and Box and Whisker charts. 1 Histogram chart illustrates the distribution of data. 2 Histogram binning algorithm. 3 Gain insights through bin sizes. 4 Pareto chart highlights significant data factors. 5 Reading a Pareto chart. 6 Box and Whisker characterize the distribution of data.\n[8] Seven of the most common graphs in statistics are listed below: 1 Pareto Diagram or Bar Graph - A bar graph contains a bar for each category of a set of qualitative data. 2 Pie Chart or Circle Graph - A pie chart displays qualitative data in the form of a pie. 3 Histogram - A histogram in another kind of graph that uses bars in its display.\n[9] More generally the 80/20 distribution which has come to be known as the Pareto Principle can be observed in many other areas of life.

There are number of charts used to evaluate and analyze quality results within a project. Two charts that are similar and often confused are the histogram and Pareto chart. A histogram is a type of bar chart showing a distribution of variables. A histogram represents each attribute or characteristic as a column and the frequency of each attribute or characteristic occurring as the height of the column.\n[8] Histogram or Bar Graph; Check Lists; Check Sheets; Pareto Principle. The Pareto principle suggests that most effects come from relatively few causes. In quantitative terms: 80% of the problems come from 20% of the causes (machines, raw materials, operators etc.); 80% of the wealth is owned by 20% of the people etc.\n[9] This observation is expanded to many other areas and it's called it Pareto principle.

Two charts that are similar and often confused are the histogram and Pareto chart. A histogram is a type of bar chart showing a distribution of variables. A histogram represents each attribute or characteristic as a column and the frequency of each attribute or characteristic occurring as the height of the column.\n[15] Histogram chart illustrates the distribution of data. The Histogram chart shows the distribution of your data and groups them into bins, which are groupings of data points within a given range. To show in an example, imagine we run a small bookstore and have a list of our entire selection of books and prices. The Histogram, Pareto and Box and Whisker charts can be easily inserted using the new Statistical Chart button in the Insert tab on the ribbon. The Histogram chart is the first option listed. By creating a Histogram to visualize the above table of data, we can count all the books by bins that represent price ranges.\n[16] Seven of the most common graphs in statistics are listed below: 1 Pareto Diagram or Bar Graph - A bar graph contains a bar for each category of a set of qualitative data. 2 Pie Chart or Circle Graph - A pie chart displays qualitative data in the form of a pie. 3 Histogram - A histogram in another kind of graph that uses bars in its display.\n[17] Pareto Analysis. Here are eight steps to identifying the principal causes you should focus on, using Pareto Analysis: Create a vertical bar chart with causes on the x-axis and count (number of occurrences) on the y-axis. Arrange the bar chart in descending order of cause importance that is, the cause with the highest count first.\n[18] A histogram is a bar graph that illustrates the frequency of an event occurring using the height of the bar as an indicator. A Pareto chart is a special type of histogram that represents the Pareto philosophy (the 80/20 rule) through displaying the events by order of impact.\n[19] Creating a Pareto Chart in Excel. The Pareto Principle, named for Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, suggests that 80% of problems can be traced to as few as 20% of root causes. This can be valuable, even vital information when you are trying to figure out which of many problems to tackle first, or in a complicated troubleshooting environment.\n[20] The purpose of the Pareto chart is to highlight the most important among a (typically large) set of factors. In quality control, it often represents the most common sources of defects, the highest occurring type of defect, or the most frequent reasons for customer complaints, and so on.\nSearch Query: define pareto chart in statistics.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

The chronograph watch was named after the famous racetrack in Daytona Beach, Florida, and is an anomaly for the Geneva-based brand most known for prestigious watches with three hands.\n[4] Charles Babbage is credited with creating an early type of a speedometer, which were usually fitted to locomotives. The electric speedometer was invented by the Croatian Josip Belu\u0161i\u0107 in 1888, and was originally called a velocimeter.\n[5] Rolex first concentrated on the quality of the movements. The relentless quest for chronometric precision rapidly led to success. In 1910, a Rolex watch was the first wristwatch in the world to receive the Swiss Certificate of Chronometric Precision, granted by the Official Watch Rating Centre in Bienne.\n[6] The next great advancement in timekeeping was in 1967, when the atomic clock, which used the oscillations of cesium-133 atoms to tell time, was invented. This clock had an error ratio of 1 second for every 1.4 million years.\n[7] - Mechanical Clocks The mechanical clock we know today was probably a result of a development of inventions and theories throughout the centuries, for we do not know precisely when the clock as we know it was first invented. In the 13th Century a clock was devised that used weights to drive a drum containing mercury.\n[8] Who invented the 24-hour clock? A: The 24-hour clock was developed in ancient Egypt and was based upon careful astronomical observations and shadow clocks similar to the modern garden's sundial. Originally the length of these hours varied from season to season due to differing lengths of daylight.\n[9] Freebase(0.00 / 0 votes)Rate this definition: Chronograph. A chronograph is a specific type of watch that is used as a stopwatch combined with a display watch. A basic chronograph has an independent sweep second hand; it can be started, stopped, and returned to zero by successive pressure on the stem.\n[10] The first mechanical clocks, employing the verge escapement mechanism with a foliot or balance wheel timekeeper, were invented in Europe at around the start of the 14th century, and became the standard timekeeping device until the pendulum clock was invented in 1656.he first mechanical clocks, employing the verge escapement mechanism with a foliot or balance wheel timekeeper, were invented in Europe at around the start of the 14th century, and became the standard timekeeping device until the pendulum clock was invented in 1656.\n[11] The Pendulum Clock Before the pendulum clock was invented, a German man called Peter Henlein, invented the Spring powered clock in 1510. Sadly, the style was wrought with problems, such as inaccuracy. As the clocks became more accurate, so a new device was needed and so in 1577, Jost Burgi invented the minute hand.This addition had many problems and was not considered practical until the a man named Christian Huygens invented the pendulum clock.s the clocks became more accurate, so a new device was needed and so in 1577, Jost Burgi invented the minute hand.

If you have a chronograph, chances are tachymeter scale is on it. It's a scale which is usually printed on the bezel to let users know the speed of a moving object if they know the distance it traveled. A simple example is with F1 race.\n[13] Benjamin Banneker has been credited for making the first clock to be built completely in America. At age 58, Banneker began the study of astronomy and was soon predicting future solar and lunar eclipses.\n[14] The Water Clock Around 1400 BC (around 3,400 years ago), the Egyptians invented the water clock, or as they called it the Clepsydra (pronounced KLEP-suh-druh). These water clocks were made from two containers of water, one higher than the other.s the clocks became more accurate, so a new device was needed and so in 1577, Jost Burgi invented the minute hand. This addition had many problems and was not considered practical until the a man named Christian Huygens invented the pendulum clock.\n[15] When he opened his workshop, Breitling specialized in making chronograph pocket watches and precision counters, which were used primarily scientific and industrial purposes. In 1892, Breitling moved his shop to La Chaux-de-Fonds, which was the hub of the successful Swiss watchmaking industry during that time.\n[16] Perrelet is considered the father of the automatic watch. He introduced the concept in 1770 and was way ahead of his time since the invention was better suited to wristwatches. Perrelet lived in the pocket watch era and, because the watches did not move much in pockets, the rotor system did not perform so well.\n[17] This makes chronograph watch to be sold at a higher price than normal watches or stopwatches. But the advantage of chronograph watch is it's a 2-in-1 device: you can wear the watch and measure any time without bringing a separate stopwatch. This is one of the reason why chronograph watches are popular.\n[18] Before this the error was from 10 to 15 minutes a day. During the 1600's the metallic gear, or toothed wheel, and the use of the screw in assembling the clocks were first used.

A German clockmaker named Peter Henlein created small, spring-powered clocks in 1510. These clocks were rarely accurate but were small enough to be portable. In the 17th century, pocket watches came into fashion and new springs were invented to make them more accurate.\n[2] Clocks The first mechanical clock was invented in the early 1300's. With this invention time began to be measured in hours (24 hours equaling a day). Galileo, an Italian scientist, discovered the pendulum in 1581.n 1456 Gutenberg invented the printing press. This created a widespread of books. Once people owned books reading glasses began to be seen in the hands of the common people. These glasses were made with a variety of materials including wood, lead, copper, bone, leather, and even horn.\n[3] Rating Newest Oldest.

As recorded on Ask.com, many people credit Josef Pallweber, a Swiss timepiece maker born in Salzburg, Austria, with the original idea for a digital timepiece. His 1956 clock model was said to be more analog than a true digital clock.\n[10] George Daniels' first horological exercise was a Marine Chronometer which he made in 1953.

Most of the five hundred year History of watches consisted of the development of the mechanical watch. Watches evolved from portable spring driven clocks, which first appeared in 15th-century Europe. Portable timepieces were made possible by the invention of the mainspring in the early 15th century. Nuremberg clockmaker Peter Henlein (or Henle or Hele) (1485-1542) is often credited as the inventor of the watch.\n[4] The metronome was invented by Dietrich Nikolaus Winkel in Amsterdam in 1812. A man called Johann Maelzel copied Winkel's ideas and improved them. He made a small, portable metronome which was patented in 1816. The metronome made it possible for a composer to show the performer what speed he wanted. If the composer writes at the top of his music: Crotchet (quarter note) = 76, for example, then the metronome can be set at 76 and it will tick at the right speed for that piece of music. Sometimes they write MM76.\n[5] A chronograph is a watch with timekeeping capability as well as the ability to function as a stopwatch. A chronograph can be equipped with as few as one or as many as four sub-dials, depending upon the precision and design of the watch. Any watch that has a stopwatch complication is considered a chronograph, no matter how expensive or inexpensive the timepiece is.\n[6] The first mechanical clock was made in 723 A.D. by a monk and mathematician I-Hsing.nswered by The Community.

The Rolex Oyster Chronograph reference 6234 featured a tachometer scale on the outer ring and a telemeter scale for distances on the inner ring.\n[3] The British prize was won by John Harrison in 1764 for his seagoing chronometer accurate to one-tenth of a second per day. James Cook used Harrisons chronometer to circumvent the globe and when he returned in 1779 his calculations of longitude based upon the chronometer proved correct to within 8 miles.\n[4] The Marine Chronometer: A Breakthrough in Celestial Navigation. written by: Manu \u2022 edited by: Lamar Stonecypher \u2022 updated: 2/14/2009 Christopher Columbus was so lost without a marine chronometer that he landed up in America looking for India.\n[5] What does the word part ''chron-'' mean? It is from the Greek word for time. A chronometer is something which measures time (chron=time, meter=measure), in other words a clock. The spelling chron as opposed to cr\u2026ohn means this word has nothing to do with Crohns disease which was named after Dr. Burrill Crohn. 9 people found this useful.\n[6] Who Invented the Clock? - Mechanical Clocks The mechanical clock we know today was probably a result of a development of inventions and theories throughout the centuries, for we do not know precisely when the clock as we know it was first invented.

A chronograph is a watch with timekeeping capability as well as the ability to function as a stopwatch. A chronograph can be equipped with as few as one or as many as four sub-dials, depending upon the precision and design of the watch. chronograph is any watch with a separate stopwatch feature, and its precision can vary; but chronographs tend to be very precise, as they are usually offered on high-end Swiss timepieces. A chronometer, however, is an officially certified chronograph whose precision has been tested.\n[8] A chronograph designation is often confused with a chronometer one, though they are completely different. A chronograph is basically a watch with stopwatch capabilities. It displays different counters or mechanisms for measuring elapsed time. Counters can register seconds, minutes and hours.\n[9] Harrison was granted additional money to develop the clock. John Harrison's H3 Chronometer. Harrison spent 17 years working on the third clock, but it did not perform as well as he had imagined. Nevertheless, it was quite a valuable experiment.\n[10] Chronograph is just a fancy name for a watch.

A few months ago we reviewed here in Monochrome the new Omega Globemaster introduced in Baselworld this year. The specific model continues the company's ever-lasting quest for accuracy squeezed out from a highly tuned mechanical wristwatch platform.\n[3] Where a highly complex watch is a bold and visible display of watchmaking art, the pursuit of absolute precision is the application of vast skill that often goes unnoticed by the consumer. The chronometer is a finely crafted and highly tuned mechanical watch that exhibits the highest degree of accuracy possible. Outside of high-complications, the building of chronometers is one of the top-tiers of watchmaking that exhibits also any given company's technical ability and know-how.\n[4] A chronograph is a specific type of watch that is used as a stopwatch combined with a display watch. A basic chronograph has an independent sweep second hand; it can be started, stopped, and returned to zero by successive pressure on the stem. Less simple chronographs use additional complications and can have multiple independent hands to measure seconds, minutes, hours and even tenths of a second.\n[5] A chronograph is a specific type of watch that is used as a stopwatch combined with a display watch.

His fame is based on a passage by Johann Cochlaeus cochl\u00e4us in: 1511\n[11] John Harrison. For other people named John Harrison, see John Harrison (disambiguation). John Harrison (3 April [O.S. 24 March] 1693 \u2013 24 March 1776) was a self-educated English carpenter and clockmaker who invented the marine chronometer, a long-sought-after device for solving the problem of calculating longitude while at sea.\n[12] The British prize was won by John Harrison in 1764 for his seagoing chronometer accurate to one-tenth of a second per day. James Cook used Harrisons chronometer to circumvent the globe and when he returned in 1779 his calculations of longitude based upon the chronometer proved correct to within 8 miles.\n[13] As with most things in the Swiss watch industry, the term chronometer is closely guarded. A watch must pass through the Contr\u00f4le Officiel Suisse des Chronom\u00e8tres (COSC) in order to carry the term on its dial.\n[14] Credit: tongeron91 CC-BY 2.0. A watch with chronograph movement has stopwatch capabilities. It accurately measures elapsed time in seconds, minutes and hours. A watch earns the designation chronometer after it has passed multiple tests administered by the Swiss Official Chronometer Control.\n[15] A chronometer's mechanical movement is close to perfection, so the time it displays is almost always accurate (unlike other self-winding or automatic watches), and therefore carries a premium price over non-chronometer watches.\n[16] Rolex first concentrated on the quality of the movements. The relentless quest for chronometric precision rapidly led to success. In 1910, a Rolex watch was the first wristwatch in the world to receive the Swiss Certificate of Chronometric Precision, granted by the Official Watch Rating Centre in Bienne.\n[17] And in late 1965 NASA, following three years of arduous testing with a selection of chronographs made by the top brands of the day, chose Omega's Speedmaster (the only model to have passed all their tests!) as its official chronometer.\n[18] In 1974 Omega produces Marine Chronometer 2400 which is the most accurate and the most technologically advanced wristwatch in the world. This legendary Omega Megaquartz marine-chronometer had a daily timing variation of just two thousands of a second, in a trial lasting for 63 days. In its search of elegance, Omega has relied on the most prestigious jeweler designers and created real masterpieces of the highest refinement.\n[19] Founded in 1948 in Besan\u00e7on by Henry Louis Belmont, the company distinguished itself in the very beginning by creating the first automatic chronometers manufactured entirely in France, and became famous for the technical qualities and sports characteristics of its watches.\n[20] Perrelet is considered the father of the automatic watch. He introduced the concept in 1770 and was way ahead of his time since the invention was better suited to wristwatches. Perrelet lived in the pocket watch era and, because the watches did not move much in pockets, the rotor system did not perform so well.\nSearch Query: what is chronometer who invented it.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

The first one invented was a marine chronometer, and it was created out of the necessity to have an accurate timekeeper for sea travel. John Harrison, a British clockmaker, invented this device in 1737.\n[2] The term chronometer was coined by Jeremy Thacker of Beverley, England in 1714, referring to his invention of a clock ensconced in a vacuum chamber. The term chronometer is also used to describe a marine chronometer used for celestial navigation and determination of longitude. The marine chronometer was invented by John Harrison in 1730. This was the first of a series of chronometers that enabled accurate marine navigation. From then on, an accurate chronometer was essential to deep sea marine or air navigation out of sight of land.\n[3] The invention of the chronometer was a fundamental building block for modern times. But the marine chronometer was then redesigned by John Arnold. He based his design on Harrison's clock, but he simplified it enough to produce accurate marine chronometers in large quantities during the late 1700s.\n[4] The term chronometer is also used to describe a marine chronometer used for celestial navigation and determination of longitude. The marine chronometer was invented by John Harrison in 1730. This was the first of a series of chronometers that enabled accurate marine navigation. From then on, an accurate chronometer was essential to deep sea marine or air navigation out of sight of land.\n[5] Before the first genuine stopwatch was released, another similar timepiece set the mold for the stopwatch's design and function: the chronograph. While it is known that the first chronograph surfaced in 1821, there is much controversy over who is credited with inventing it.\n[6] The term chronometer (from Greek: \u03a7\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf) is a specific type of mechanical timepiece tested and certified to meet certain precision standards.

The marine chronometer was developed out of the necessity to have a timekeeper of great accuracy that would function at sea. The need for this was to enable the ships navigator to find Longitude out of the sight of land and thus his position on the seas and oceans of the world.\n[9] He invented the marine chronometer, a long-sought after device for solving the problem of establishing the East-West position or longitude of a ship at sea, thus revolutionising and extending the possibility of safe long-distance sea travel in the Age of Sail.\n[10] Chronometer watch.

The words dog days of summer might conjure up images of canines panting in the heat, but the origin of the phrase actually has to do with the stars. Historians say the phrase dates back to the ancient Greeks and Romans, who would keep track of the seasons by looking up at the sky.\n[14] Instead, it turns out, the dog days refer to the dog star, Sirius, and its position in the heavens. To the Greeks and Romans, the \"dog days\" occurred around the day when Sirius appeared to rise just before the sun, in late July.\n[15] Lilies in the late July heat, Lemnos, Greece. The dog days or dog days of summer are the hot, sultry days of summer. They were historically the period following the heliacal rising of the star Sirius, which Greek and Roman astrology connected with heat, drought, sudden thunderstorms, lethargy, fever, mad dogs, and bad luck. They are now taken to be the hottest, most uncomfortable part of summer in the Northern Hemisphere.\n[16] The Dog Days of Summer. The \"dog days of summer\" occur during the hottest and muggiest part of the season. Webster defines \"dog days\" as The period between early July and early September when the hot sultry weather of summer usually occurs in the northern hemisphere.\n[17] For example, It's hard to get much work done during the dog days, or Every winter there's a week or two of dog days when sales drop dramatically. The term alludes to the period between early July and early September, when Sirius, the so-called Dog Star, rises and sets with the sun. The ancient Romans called this phenomenon dies caniculares, which was translated as \"dog days\" in the first half of the 1500s.\n[18] However, the phrase doesn't stem from lazy dogs lying around on hot and humid days. Instead, to find the answer, we only need to look to the summer sky. The ancient Romans called the hottest, most humid days of summer \"di\u0113s canicul\u0101r\u0113s or \"dog days..\n[19] The phrase does have to do with a dog, and a very old dog at that. The ancient Romans also called the six or eight hottest weeks of summer the dog days, or, in Latin, dies caniculares.. But the dog in question wasn't Fido's Roman ancestor (although the common canine name Fido is from the Latin for faithful).\n[20] Title Why are they called the \"dog days\" of summer? The sultry \"dog days\" of summer might spark visions of listless canines baking in the oppressive heat, but the moniker has nothing to do with panting pooches. Instead, it's a throwback to the time when ancient civilizations tracked the seasons by looking to the sky.\nSearch Query: dog day afternoon meaning.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

If you're already eating plenty of them, keep up the good work. If not, begin adding them into your diet today.\n[16] To lower your cholesterol, you can actually eat more of certain foods. A handful of some functional foods have been shown to make a big impact on your cholesterol levels. They're also much tastier than a pill chased with a glass of water. These foods may not be magic, but they're close to it, says Ruth Frechman, RD, a spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association. Researchers have found that some foods -- such as fatty fish, walnuts, oatmeal, and oat bran, and foods fortified with plant sterols or stanols -- can help control your cholesterol. Some studies have shown that a diet combining these superfoods may work as well as some cholesterol-lowering medicines to reduce your bad LDL cholesterol levels.\n[17] Super Food 1 - Soya Foods. Being naturally low in saturated fat, soya foods help lower cholesterol. The special proteins in soya also appear to influence how the body regulates cholesterol too. Studies show you can lower your cholesterol by around 6% by including as little as 15g soya protein per day.\n[18] To help you start, we've listed the top 10 foods that help you lower cholesterol \u2013 but remember, they only work when combined with an active and healthy lifestyle! 1. Soy. Soy beans are one of the best things you can eat to reduce your cholesterol.\n[19] Other cholesterol-lowering foods are rich in the \"good fats\" (monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats) that directly lower LDL (bad) cholesterol.

At the bottom end of the price scale, the Aleko WG450A Wind Turbine Generator with a 450 Watt 24 Volt capacity was selling for $402 in 2015. Micro-turbines are largely for hobby purposes.\n[5] Commercial wind turbines consistantly in almost every company that makes them, cost 1 million dollars per mega watt the turbine can produce. So if you have a 3 mega watt wind turbine it will cost roughly 3 million dollars, with another 1/2 a million or so for instalation.\n[6] this is a per megawatt cost of about $ 3 million to $ 8 million at the bottom end of the price scale the aleko wg450a wind turbine generator with a 450 watt 24 volt capacity was selling for $ 402 in 2015micro turbines are largely for hobby purposesnly very large industrial wind turbines have megawatt costs that approach $ 100 they cost far more than an individual homeowner could likely afford even if there were someplace to put such a large and noisy unit industrial wind turbines can be heard more than a mile away from their sources\n[7] Basing the lease on a share of revenues can help capture future increases in the value of wind power. Landowner payments are typically about $2,500 to $5,000 per wind turbine per year. In this arrangement, you retain ownership of your land.\n[8] how much does a wind turbine cost can be answered as under the cost of the commercial wind turbines varied from $ 1 to $ 2 million per mw of nameplate capacity installed the same turbines 2 mw in size cost roughly $ 2 8 million installed capacity\n[9] The most common turbine erected at the moment would have a 1000 kW generator, a tower 60 to 80 metres high and a rotor with a diameter of 54 metres. \u00a3800 per Kilowatt Average. For a large, modern wind turbine (in the 1000 kW range) is approximately \u00a3800 per kW of electrical power to install.A 1000 kW turbine would be expected to produce 26,280,000 kWh in a year*, although this depends on the wind.ecause of economies of scale, comparing a 150 kW wind turbine with a 600 kW machine, the price of the larger turbine will be roughly triple, instead of quadruple the price of the smaller turbine.\n[10] This is a per megawatt cost of about $3 million to $8 million. At the bottom end of the price scale, the Aleko WG450A Wind Turbine Generator with a 450 Watt 24 Volt capacity was selling for $402 in 2015.\n[11] There are no batteries in a modern residential wind system. The wind turbine typically lowers your utility bill by 50-90%. It is not uncommon for homeowners with total electric homes and Bergey turbines to have monthly utility bills of $8-$15 for part of the year.\n[12] An $18,000 system ($12,600 after the tax credit) that produces 3800 kWh a year in a windy place with 12mph avg. windspeed will produce 76,000 kWh over its 20-year life, for a cost of $0.17 per kWh. That's much more than grid energy, and way more than solar.\n[13] The payments for a wind turbine will vary based on the location and the utility company. Here are some published payment amounts from different states. A wind turbine contract from 2009 in Indiana paid $1.10 per megawatt hour but not less than $3,500 per megawatt rated capacity per year. The North Dakota State University report listed payments of $4,000 to $6,000 per megawatt of rated power or royalties of three to five percent of gross electricity sales.\n[14] all estimates for wind power include the cost of purchasing capital and paying for operations and maintenance o m of wind turbines for the studies we examined capital costs ranged from $ 48 to $ 88 per megawatt hour while o m costs ranged from $ 9 8 to $ 21 per megawatt hour many estimates however don t include costs related to the inherent unreliability of wind power and government subsidies and mandates\n[15] other factors which have an impact on your project economics are financing costs the size of the project and applicability of taxes how much does a wind turbine cost can be answered as under the cost of the commercial wind turbines varied from $ 1 to $ 2 million per mw of nameplate capacity installed\n[16] Each turbine produces about 2,000,000 kilowatt hours (kwh) per year, enough energy to power as many as 500 typical homes at 12,000 kwh per year. How strong do the winds have to blow for the blades to rotate? Wind turbines start operating at wind speeds of around 8 mph and reach a maximum power output at around 33 mph. When there is not enough wind to turn the blades, or when there is too much wind the turbines shut down. How much do wind turbines cost? It costs over $2.5 million to set up a 1650 KW turbine. How many turbines are there in Minnesota?\n[17] As a wind turbine will generally bring in a lease value of $5000 - $8000 per year to the owner of the land, and as that is higher than most crops will yield per acre per year, it's an excellent additional revenue stream, especially for the multi-revenue stream, small-business owners we call farmers.t is not the fault of the system, but average winds. Wind Turbines are rated at between 25 and 28 MPH winds. If the wind goes over 31 MPH, most systems shut down. Power is cubed, so a wind of 14 MPH provides 100KWH from a 1 MWH system.\n[18] Wind turbines account for 64% to 84% of total installed costs onshore, with grid connection costs, construction costs, and other costs making up the balance. O\u02c6shore wind farms are more expensive and cost USD 4 000 to USD 4 500/kW, with the wind turbines accounting for 44% to 50% of the total cost.&M costs for onshore wind farms in major wind markets averages between USD 0.01/kWh and USD 0.025/kWh. The O&M costs of o\u02c6shore wind farms are higher due to the di'culties posed by the o\u02c6shore environment and can be between USD 0.027 and USD 0.048/kWh.\n[19] 1 The Department of Energy finds that \" Among a large sample of wind projects installed in 2012, the capacity-weighted average installed cost stood at nearly $1,940/kW, down almost $200/kW from the reported average cost in 2011 and down almost $300/kW from the reported average cost in both 2009 and 2010 .\" (3).

A general rule of thumb, as of early 2013, is that commercial scale wind projects cost from $1.2 to $2.2 million per MW of nameplate capacity installed. In moderately windy areas, such as much of the midwest, look for a wind project to deliver energy for 6 cents or less per kWh.enerally, leases for megawatt-scale turbines will range from $3,000-$12,000 per turbine per year depending on the size of the turbine, the wind resource in the area, and the amount of land required for the construction.\n[3] in this manner 100 kilowatts wind turbines would cost roughly $ 2800 to $ 4800 per kilowatt of capacity to conclude how much does a wind turbine cost can be summarized by proper negotiation considering engineering and other related factors and reducing over all cost incidence on the production process\n[4] All estimates for wind power include the cost of purchasing capital and paying for operations and maintenance (O&M) of wind turbines. For the studies we examined, capital costs ranged from $48 to $88 per megawatt-hour, while O&M costs ranged from $9.8 to $21 per megawatt-hour. Many estimates, however, don't include costs related to the inherent unreliability of wind power and government subsidies and mandates.\n[5] The cost to maintain a wind turbine is estimated to be about 2% of the original investment per year. The cost of a wind turbine is $50,000.\n[6] 1 Wind turbine prices have fallen 20% to 40% from their highs back in 2008, and these declines are pushing project-level costs down. 2 Wind projects built in 2014 had an average installed cost of $1,710/kW, down almost $600/kW from the peak in 2009 and 2010.\n[7] The most common turbine erected at the moment would have a 1000 kW generator, a tower 60 to 80 metres high and a rotor with a diameter of 54 metres. \u00a3800 per Kilowatt Average.

The costs for a utility scale wind turbine range from about $1.3 million to $2.2 million per MW of nameplate capacity installed. Most of the commercial-scale turbines installed today are 2 MW in size and cost roughly $3-$4 million installed.\n[4] During its first year of operation, their wind turbine produced 6,286 kWh of electricity \u2014 worth about $627 at the current retail rate of $0.10 per kWh. That means that the $40,500 wind turbine will have a simple payback period of about 64 years. Unfortunately, the turbine is unlikely to last that long.\n[5] The total installation cost can be expressed as a function of the wind system's rated electrical capacity. A grid-connected residential-scale system (1-10 kW) generally costs between $2,400 and $3,000 per installed kilowatt. That's $24,000-$30,000 for a 10 kW system.A medium-scale, commercial system (10-100 kW) is more cost-effective, costing between $1,500 and $2,500 per kilowatt.Large-scale systems of greater than l00 kW cost in the range of $1,000 to $2,000 per kilowatt, with the lowest costs achieved when multiple units are installed at one location. medium-scale, commercial system (10-100 kW) is more cost-effective, costing between $1,500 and $2,500 per kilowatt.

Coturnix may start laying eggs as early as 6 weeks of age compared to 16 weeks for the Bobwhite.\n[5] The Bobwhite is larger than the Japanese quail, however the Coturnix produces larger eggs. The incubation time needed for fertile eggs is shorter (14-17 days) compared to Bobwhite quail eggs (23 days). Coturnix may start laying eggs as early as 6 weeks of age compared to 16 weeks for the Bobwhite.\n[6] If your quails are new, give them time to settle in. Quails can get stress from all the new surroundings and from the long move. It can take up to 2-6 weeks for quails to settle in and start laying eggs whilst some quails can settle in straight away and start laying eggs 2 days after moving.\n[7] They are affected by common poultry diseases but are fairly disease resistant. Japanese quail mature in about 6 weeks and are usually in full egg production by 50 days of age. With proper care, hens should lay 200 eggs in their first year of lay.Life expectancy is only 2 to 2\u00bd years.\u2022ales The fem are characterised by light tan feathers with black speckling on the throat and upper breast.hey are affected by common poultry diseases but are fairly disease resistant.

Here is list of quails and the number of days in when these quails hatch: Elegant Quail:22 days. Blue Scaled Quail:23 days. Bobwhite Quail:22-23 days. Button Quail:16 days.\n[9] Really productive strains of Japanese or Coturnix quail as they are sometimes called can lay up to 300 eggs in a year, but for this level of egg production they do require the correct quail feed as well as some additional light over the dark winter months.\n[10] Usually the hen will keep sitting if she thinks the other eggs are fertile and I have read that the hen can feel movement in the eggs so will keep sitting. Quail eggs take about 17 days to hatch and hen eggs take 21 days.\n[11] Quail start to lay eggs at just 8-12 weeks (assuming there is enough daylight) so they are productive very quickly compared to chickens. Four quail eggs are roughly the same as a chicken egg, although they have a slightly higher quantity of yolk to white in an egg.\n[12] Best Answer: Hi, You don't say which species of quail you have, so I'll have to guess.lol.

Crazy, right? The first 17 days are spent incubating and days 18 and sometimes 19 are spent hatching. Much like chickens, there is no calendar in that egg, so quail chicks may begin to arrive as early as day 16 and as late as day 20.\n[14] How Long Does It Take For Quail To Lay Fertile Eggs. September 25, 2008January 19, 2009 by sara. How long does it take to lay fertile quail eggs is an excellent question and was asked by one of my regular readers and quail keepers, Junior.\n[15] If the situation arises that Button quail eggs have to be incubated and / or any baby quail hand raised, this presents a bigger problem than with the other types of quail. The Coturnix quail instinctively pick up and eat food off the floor whereas the Button quail expect the food to be placed in their beak.uail often have no choice but to eat the foods that are supplied to the other birds. This is often a mix of basic finch seed mix along with some other select seeds and often a supply of live food such as mealworms. Mealworms can be fed as the larval (worm) stage as well as the pupa and beetle stage.\n[16] Japanese quail are hardy birds that thrive in small cages and are inexpensive to keep.

They begin laying eggs in 6 to 8 weeks and the eggs only take 17 days to incubate. Because Coturnix quail mature extremely quickly, the waiting period to enjoy the fruits of your labors are very quick.\n[2] 1 Always collect eggs at least once a day to prevent the quail sitting on the egg (both female and male will sit on the egg). 2 Realise that a quail only lays one egg a day. If your quails are still not laying eggs, this may indicate that they are sick.\n[3] Quail reach sexual maturity and begin laying eggs at the age of just 6 or 7 weeks. Males reach sexual maturity and can mate a week or so earlier. You can sex your quail at approximately 3 weeks of age, as differences in male and female plumage emerge.\n[4] Quail lay eggs early and often. These tiny birds begin laying while barely little more than chicks themselves, and can lay up to 300 eggs annually. In the United States, the coturnix quail is the most common type raised domestically. This breed is also known as the Japanese quail, the Bible quail and the Nile quail.\n[5] Usually a good age for quakers to breed is 18 months. Quakers lay anywhere up to 7 eggs in a clutch (usually around 5 is common), and they hatch after 24 days.The female will lay one egg every other day, and start to incubate after the second or third egg is laid.est Answer: Place a box in with them a big box. If they lay eggs it will be around 10 days after mating. They will hatch if fertile around 21 days depending on how warm or cool it is in the room they are kept. But I can tell you from experience quaker babies won't be heard crying for food until around 3 weeks old.\n[6] A quail which is breed to lay eggs should receive 14 hours of light per day. This may mean that artificial lightning may be needed. If the quail receives the right amount of l \u2026 ight, they will approx.lay 1 egg per day. On average they will lay 200-300 eggs per year. I hope this answered your question.ow many eggs do quail lay at one time? No bird can lay more than an egg every day (or just a little less than 24 hours).\n[7] Adult red-chested buttonquails are 12\u201316 cm long with males weighing 27-46 g and females 31-83 g. The species is smaller in size than the painted button-quail. Viewed from behind, red-chested buttonquail look uniformly pale grey across the upper-wings and back.\n[8] Once the male and female quail start to mate then you will get fertile eggs. An indication that male quail are fertile is the foamball they have on their droppings. Eggs are usually fertile from about week 7/8 a week or two after the females start laying as long as they have had males in with them.nce the male and female quail start to mate then you will get fertile eggs.

Eggs are usually fertile from about week 7/8 a week or two after the females start laying as long as they have had males in with them.\n[9] Bobwhite quail eggs will hatch 23-24 days from the time they are set in the incubator. The ideal temperature in a forced-air incubator should be 99.5 degrees F with a relative humidity at approximately 60 percent.Temperature fluctuations may prolong or shorten the exact length of incubation.obwhite quail production should be a primary enterprise on a farming operation for a grower to invest in this type of facility, which ranges $7-8/ft2. With a bird density in enclosed barns at 2.0-2.5/ ft2, housing 25,000 quail could be very expensive.\n[10] Quick Answer. Quail eggs hatch in less than a month. They live three to five years and reach sexual maturity in two years. Quails may lay up to 12 eggs at a time.

The average clutch size is 10 to 12 eggs, incubating about three weeks before hatching. The Gambel's quail hen lays eggs once a year.\n[6] The quail begin to breed and lay eggs at only six to eight weeks of age, as opposed to the 20 to 24 weeks required for a chicken to begin producing.

My experience is with Japanese (Coturnix) Quail and Button Quail only, so here are the incubation and hatch times for those two. Japanese (Coturnix) Quail eggs hatch around 17-18 days once you start incubation. They can take up to 21-22 days to hatch, so don't worry if they don't hatch on day 17. Some may even hatch as early as day 15. Button Quail eggs hatch around 16-17 days once you start incubation. It can take up to 22 days, so don't worry if they don't hatch on day 16.

Maintaining the same number of hours under lights will keep your Cortunix quail laying eggs throughout the year. Under prime conditions, each female bird will lay about 300 eggs each year.\n[2] Reproduction. Quail nest in Louisiana from early May through September with most of the hatching occurring from June to August. Clutch size ranges from 12 to 15 eggs. After 23 days of incubation the chicks hatch and are totally flightless for about two weeks.\n[3] 1 An adult quail weights between 150 to 200 grams and an egg weights around 7 to 15 grams. 2 Female quails start laying eggs within their 6 to 7 weeks of age and continuously lay one egg daily. 3 They lay about 300 eggs in their first year of life.\n[4] No bird can lay more than an egg every day (or just a little less than 24 hours).

They can lay up to 100 eggs a year in the right environment and diet.I would only keep her with one male. was wondering about my Bobwhite Quail, I have I think 2 males and 1 female, well for sure the female and one male not sure about the other one, They are a little over 15 weeks old and I noticed that she was hunkering down when the boy comes over to her.\n[10] Here is list of quails and the number of days in when these quails hatch: Elegant Quail:22 days Blue Scaled Quail:23 days Bobwhite Quail:22-23 days Button Quail:16 days California Quail:22-23 days Coturnix Quail:16-18 days Gambel's Quail:22 days Montezuma Quail:24-25 days Mountain Quail:24-25 days.ere is list of quails and the number of days in when these quails hatch: Elegant Quail:22 days Blue Scaled Quail:23 days Bobwhite Quail:22-23 days Button Quail:16 days California Quail:22-23 days Coturnix Quail:16-18 days Gambel's Quail:22 days Montezuma Quail:24-25 days Mountain Quail:24-25 days.\n[11] Quail lay eggs early and often. These tiny birds begin laying while barely little more than chicks themselves, and can lay up to 300 eggs annually. In the United States, the coturnix quail is the most common type raised domestically. This breed is also known as the Japanese quail, the Bible quail and the Nile quail.\n[12] A quail which is breed to lay eggs should receive 14 hours of light per day. This may mean that artificial lightning may be needed. If the quail receives the right amount of l \u2026 ight, they will approx.lay 1 egg per day. On average they will lay 200-300 eggs per year. I hope this answered your question.ow many eggs do quail lay at one time? No bird can lay more than an egg every day (or just a little less than 24 hours).\n[13] Quail start to lay eggs at just 8-12 weeks (assuming there is enough daylight) so they are productive very quickly compared to chickens. Four quail eggs are roughly the same as a chicken egg, although they have a slightly higher quantity of yolk to white in an egg.\n[14] In the right conditions, each hen can lay 300+ per year. They begin laying eggs in 6 to 8 weeks and the eggs only take 17 days to incubate. Because Coturnix quail mature extremely quickly, the waiting period to enjoy the fruits of your labors are very quick.\n[15] Japanese quail are hardy birds that thrive in small cages and are inexpensive to keep. They are affected by common poultry diseases but are fairly disease resistant. Japanese quail mature in about 6 weeks and are usually in full egg production by 50 days of age.With proper care, hens should lay 200 eggs in their first year of lay.Life expectancy is only 2 to 2\u00bd years.apanese quail are hardy birds that thrive in small cages and are inexpensive to keep. They are affected by common poultry diseases but are fairly disease resistant. Japanese quail mature in about 6 weeks and are usually in full egg production by 50 days of age.\n[16] Quail are most fertile and productive between the ages of 2 and 8 months, when hens usually lay one egg daily. At 9 months and beyond, fertility declines, although the average hen may still produce 200 or so eggs annually. For best results, keep one male with just two to three females.\n[17] How many eggs does a quail lay? Bobwhite quails lay an average of 12 eggs per clutch, though they can lay as many as 20; they only lay one egg a day. They lay a large number of eggs because they often lose their nests. It takes nearly a month for the quail to hatch.\n[18] How many eggs does a quail lay? Quick Answer. Bobwhite quails lay an average of 12 eggs per clutch, though they can lay as many as 20; they only lay one egg a day. They lay a large number of eggs because they often lose their nests. It takes nearly a month for the quail to hatch. Continue Reading.\n[19] 3. So, you have your eggs, how long do they need to be incubated for? My experience is with Japanese (Coturnix) Quail and Button Quail only, so here are the incubation and hatch times for those two. Japanese (Coturnix) Quail eggs hatch around 17-18 days once you start incubation. They can take up to 21-22 days to hatch, so don't worry if they don't hatch on day 17. Some may even hatch as early as day 15. Button Quail eggs hatch around 16-17 days once you start incubation. It can take up to 22 days, so don't worry if they don't hatch on day 16. Don't make the mistake of counting from the day they were laid.\n[20] The incubation time needed for fertile eggs is shorter (14-17 days) compared to Bobwhite quail eggs (23 days). Coturnix may start laying eggs as early as 6 weeks of age compared to 16 weeks for the Bobwhite.HISTORY: Japanese quail have been widely distributed in Europe and Asia.o not turn quail eggs after the 14th day of incubation. Japanese quail eggs will generally hatch on the 17th day of incubation, but hatch can take place as early as the 14th day and as late as the 19th day.\nSearch Query: how often to button quail lay eggs.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

With a clutch size of 6 to 15 eggs with a color of pale buff to cream. Incubation takes 24 to 25 days to incubate at 99.5\u00b0 relative Humidity 60 to 65%, stop turinig eggs on the 22 day and raise humidity to 80 to 85%. Mountain Quail Egg. Mountain Quail do very when kept in large aviaries with lots of evergreen branches for them to perch and hide.\n[2] Once the male and female quail start to mate then you will get fertile eggs. An indication that male quail are fertile is the foamball they have on their droppings. Eggs are usually fertile from about week 7/8 a week or two after the females start laying as long as they have had males in with them. It is a good idea to give the femal and males a week together after the hens have started to lay before you take the eggs for incubation. I am sorry to hear that your camera is broken.\n[3] If you normally incubate chicken eggs at 100* and 50% humidity, then do quail the same way. The only ones I've found that need it a little different are button quail because they dry out too easily. They should take 18 days to hatch but can hatch anywhere from 15-21 days. Stop turning day 14 to be safe, though I've had them hatch in the turners with little problems. Coturnix eggs are pretty easy, you could probably set them in a bowl out in your yard and they'd hatch.\n[4] They are capable of laying around 230 eggs (some have laid up to 300) if kept in the right conditions, given some light during the shorter days and adequate protection from the cold over the winter. Quail start to lay eggs at just 8-12 weeks (assuming there is enough daylight) so they are productive very quickly compared to chickens. Four quail eggs are roughly the same as a chicken egg, although they have a slightly higher quantity of yolk to white in an egg.\n[5] Breeding Quail. Always keep quails in pairs or at least one male to three hens to prevent fighting. Quails nest on the ground and lay six to twelve eggs. They sit on them for thirteen days and if the amount of eggs is too large for the hen, the cock will join her on the nest.Chicks are tiny, but are able to feed themselves straight away.hey are smaller and flightier than Japanese quail. They produce smaller eggs too. Their lifespan is three to five years. Hens have a slightly shorter lifespan as it depends on how many eggs she has laid in her lifetime and if the required nutrients such as calcium were readily available.\n[6] Bobwhite quail hens do not lay as many eggs as the coturnix, averaging 150 to 200 eggs annually. In contrast to the coturnix, bobwhite eggs take between 23 and 24 days to hatch.\n[7] The nests tend to be large because of the number of eggs they must accommodate. Female quail can lay up to 16 eggs, but more often they lay 12 to 13 eggs. Quail, especially chicks, have a high mortality rate, with only 5 to 30 percent growing into adults. After about three weeks, the eggs hatch into chicks. These chicks are instantly mobile and able to leave the nest.\n[8] The incubation time needed for fertile eggs is shorter (14-17 days) compared to Bobwhite quail eggs (23 days). Coturnix may start laying eggs as early as 6 weeks of age compared to 16 weeks for the Bobwhite.HISTORY: Japanese quail have been widely distributed in Europe and Asia.Egyptians used to trap large quantities from their farm lands for meat. In Japan, these birds were kept as pets beginning in the eleventh century.n this area, the feathers of the female quail are longer and more pointed than those of the male birds. The female Japanese may start laying eggs as early as 35 days of age under proper conditions, laying approximately 200-300 eggs a year.\n[9] This quail nests anytime between late June through August, using grass to weave a nest. Mom and dad help in the incubation process, with both taking turns sitting on the nest. It's normal for the Montezuma quail to lay a clutch of approximately 10 eggs once a year. Named for his scaled appearance on his chest, neck and belly, this bird enjoys life in the southwestern states. Her range extends up to 7,000 feet in elevation and includes open plains, mesas, sagebrush, some woodlands and hills.\n[10] Quails nest on the ground and lay six to twelve eggs. They sit on them for thirteen days and if the amount of eggs is too large for the hen, the cock will join her on the nest. Chicks are tiny, but are able to feed themselves straight away.

In spring, mating rituals begin, and in April, May and June, the birds build nests and lay their eggs. An average clutch is 10 to 16 eggs, although some species may lay up to 28 small, speckled eggs. The eggs hatch in 21 to 23 days. If the first nest is unsuccessful, California quail will make a second attempt during the summer.\n[8] Coturnix quail do not go broody so you will need to offer the necessary conditions to hatch the eggs.

If you're purchasing these quail as pets only and don't want any eggs, follow this procedure also.\n[3] Like chickens, button quail can lay one egg a day every day, for almost her entire life. Without special attention, this practice can very quickly deplete the female of her bone calcium and other essential nutrients, leading to a very early death.\n[4] Incubation for button quail takes roughly 16 days, although we have had reports of a little slower hatch of up to 18 days. We suspect that is due to the varied temperatures and movement during transportation, or perhaps due to the variance in incubator temperatures, humidity, and elevation changes.\n[5] Provide a small water dish filled with marbles for the chicks to prevent drowning. Button Quail eggs hatch after twelve to thirteen days and the chicks are able to fly after two weeks. Choose extra small gauge weld mesh, as the chicks are tiny and can jump through the holes in the wire.Seven millimetres is ideal.uails nest on the ground and lay six to twelve eggs. They sit on them for thirteen days and if the amount of eggs is too large for the hen, the cock will join her on the nest. Chicks are tiny, but are able to feed themselves straight away.\n[6] A good hatch depends on how well you know your incubator. For the first 14 days the button quail eggs should be turned (better described as being rotated from one side to the other) at least twice a day. Three or four times a day is better. If you have an automatic turner in your incubator, it will handle that for you.\n[7] Provide a small water dish filled with marbles for the chicks to prevent drowning.

I own button quail, and a button quail usually lives 21/2 years to 4 years. It's a little less for a female. It depends on how many eggs the female has laid and how adequate her nutrition is. The longest living button quail I've heard of is 9 years, but that is pretty rare.\n[9] Others are button quail african quail and bobwhite quail which are also good layers..they lays btn one and two eggs a day. On average each quail can lay 300 eggs per year meaning each quail wouldn't lay egg on each day. However, wild quails of which some farmers are supplied by comen will rarely lay eggs.\n[10] The nesting season of Common buttonquail is June to September. The nest is a slight pad of grass placed in a natural hollow in the ground where it is usually tucked away amongst the stems of a tuft of grass. Very occasionally the grass is bent over it in a sort of canopy. Sounds of Common Buttonquail The female Common Buttonquail calls with a deep hoom-hoom-hoom and the male replies in kek-kek-kek. Population of Common Buttonquail The population size of Common Buttonquail has not been quantified. But it is not believed to approach the thresholds for vulnerable under the population size criterion. The global population size of Common buttonquail has not been quantified, but the species is reported to be scarce to locally abundant.\n[11] Quail lay eggs early and often.

Other functions include stability, posture and protection. Along with the joints, which act as fulcrums, the bones and muscles work together to create levers in the body.\n[2] Basics. The muscles in your body are connected to your bones by tough, fibrous tissues called tendons. When you move a muscle, the force of this movement passes from the muscle through its associated tendon. The tendon uses this force to initiate movement of the connected bone and associated joint.Together, the muscles, bones and joints involved in this process are commonly referred to as the musculoskeletal system. body builder's arm lifting a weight with the bone highlighted. Photo Credit 4774344sean/iStock/Getty Images. Muscles are specialized tissues in your body that contain thousands of movable, elastic fibers. A particular type of muscle tissue, called skeletal muscle, is attached to bones throughout your body.\n[3] Making the world better, one answer at a time. Muscles contract to move bones. Bones and muscles work like ropes and levers. The muscles can only pull against the bone not push it.

So to bend your arm at the elbow, the bicep pulls the lower arm up. To streighten your arm, the tricep pulls the lower arm back out. the muscles have to work in pairs opposite each other to make movement.\n[4] Like all muscles, the muscles that produce movement are made upof individual cells called muscle fibers. These fibers contract and relax.Most of the muscles involved in moving the body work in pairs. Asthey contract, muscles shorten, pulling against bones. It may surpriseyou to know that muscles do not push.\n[5] Muscles are also necessary for movement: They're the masses of tough, elastic tissue that pull our bones when we move. Together, our bones, muscles, and joints \u2014 along with tendons, ligaments, and cartilage \u2014 form our musculoskeletal system and enable us to do everyday physical activities.\n[6] The bones provide a solid frame to support the body as well as protection for internal organs. The bones come together at joints which allow for movement of individual limbs as well as movement of the entire body in conjunction with skeletal tissue and the muscular system.he skeletal system and the muscular system work together as the framework for the body as well as providing the pieces that allow for movement.\n[7] ---Bones form the structure for our body, while muscles are responsible for pulling the joints, allowing \u2026 us to move.

Maintains Posture-Skeletal muscle contractions maintain posture by holding body parts in postural positions.\n[6] They control movement of the body together The muscular system and the skeletal system work together to provide support and movement for the body. Your muscles are connected to your bones by a material called cartilage. Cartilage is an extremely strong material that is impossible to tear.\n[7] Movement is made possible because of the way that bones, muscles, tendons and ligaments work together. Bones are rigid tissues that can support weight without bending.Muscle is tissue that can contract and relax to cause movement. Tendons are strong, fibrous, flexible connective tissue that joins muscles to bone.ur skeletal-muscular system enables us to move and exercise. Our joints are adapted to allow smooth movement and to resist wear and tear. Cartilage, for example, prevents bones from rubbing together. Sometimes, however, injuries do occur.\n[8] These muscles work together to produce movements such as standing, walking, running, and jumping. At the same time, the bones and joints of the leg and foot must be strong enough to support the body's weight while remaining flexible enough for movement and balance.hese muscles work together to produce movements such as standing, walking, running, and jumping.

The skeleton and muscles function together as the musculoskeletal system. This system (often treated as two separate systems, the muscular, and skeletal) plays an important homeostatic role: allowing the animal to move to more favorable external conditions. Certain cells in the bones produce immune cells as well as important cellular components of the blood.\n[10] Basics. The muscles in your body are connected to your bones by tough, fibrous tissues called tendons. When you move a muscle, the force of this movement passes from the muscle through its associated tendon. The tendon uses this force to initiate movement of the connected bone and associated joint.Together, the muscles, bones and joints involved in this process are commonly referred to as the musculoskeletal system.asics.

For this reason, they are often grouped together as the musculo-skeletal system. Muscle is attached to bone by tendons and other tissues, and exerts force by converting chemical energy into tension and contraction. Skeletal muscles which cause movement of a joint are connected to two different bones and contract to pull them together.\n[10] Every motion in any part of the body comes from the work of muscles. If a person merely bends a finger, the action comes from the muscles. Although the movement is very slight, it is brought about by the working together of muscles; with bones. Thus the muscles tend to make the parts of the body work together like the parts of a machine. How the muscles work. The greater part of a muscle is made up of tissues that expand and contract like rubber. At each end of every muscle is a tendon. This is a very strong tissue used to fasten the muscle to other parts of the body. It does not stretch. Often a tendon fastens a muscle to a bone. For example, the muscle at the front of the upper part of the arm, known as the biceps, is fastened by a tendon to the bones of the lower part of the arm just below the elbow.\n[11] These muscles work together to produce movements such as standing, walking, running, and jumping.

Only skeletal muscles work with bones and muscles keep bones in place and also play a role in the movement of bones. To allow motion, different bones are connected by joints. A skeletal muscle may attach a bone to another bone (often across a joint) or a bone to another structure, such as skin. When the muscle contracts, one of the structures usually remains stationary, while the other moves.\n[2] Vertebrates move by the actions of muscles on bones. Tendons attach many skeletal muscles across joints, allowing muscle contraction to move the bones across the joint.

They control movement of the body together The muscular system and the skeletal system work together to provide support and movement for the body.\n[8] How do our bones move? Bones cannot move without muscles. Most muscles (like those in our arms and legs) work in pairs \u2013 one muscle contracts as the other one relaxes. The bone is pulled towards the contracted muscle. Muscles are attached to bone by tendons. How are bones joined together? The place where two or more bones meet is called a joint.\n[9] The skeletal bones are held together by ligaments. Tendons attach your muscles to the bones of your skeleton. The muscular and skeletal systems work together to carry out bodily movement, and together they are called the musculoskeletal system. When muscles contract, the skeleton moves. The shape of the skeletal system also impacts movement.\n[10] Muscles, tendons, ligaments and joints all work together to produce movement due to the fact that they are all attached. As the muscles, tendons, and ligaments expand and cont \u2026 ract they pull the bones of the joint allowing the joint to move. Muscles work in groups, working in opposition one with the other In the arm, groups of muscles work by contracting and relaxing to produce gross and fine movement, \u2026 depending upon the task that the person wishes to carry out.\n[11] These muscles work together to produce movements such as standing, walking, running, and jumping. At the same time, the bones and joints of the leg and foot must be strong enough to support the body's weight while remaining flexible enough for movement and balance.hese muscles work together to produce movements such as standing, walking, running, and jumping. At the same time, the bones and joints of the leg and foot must be strong enough to support the body's weight while remaining flexible enough for movement and balance.\n[12] How both interact: The skeletal system is covered with muscles that enable us to move. These muscles are attached to the bones through tendons and often stretch from one end of the bone to the other. Your bones and muscles work together through a series of impulses and signals communicated between the brain and skeletal muscles. In order to move, the nervous system then sends signals a skeletal muscle to contract. When the muscle contracts, this movement causes the attached bone to follow.\n[13] Muscles, tendons, ligaments and joints all work together to produce movement due to the fact that they are all attached.

This chapter explains how muscles interact with bones to maintain posture and produce movement.\n[16] How They Work Together. Working in unison, the joints, bones and skeletal muscles of the body comprise your musculoskeletal system. The primary function of these components working together is to create movement. Other functions include stability, posture and protection.orking in unison, the joints, bones and skeletal muscles of the body comprise your musculoskeletal system. The primary function of these components working together is to create movement.\n[17] Every motion in any part of the body comes from the work of muscles. If a person merely bends a finger, the action comes from the muscles. Although the movement is very slight, it is brought about by the working together of muscles; with bones. Thus the muscles tend to make the parts of the body work together like the parts of a machine. How the muscles work. The greater part of a muscle is made up of tissues that expand and contract like rubber. At each end of every muscle is a tendon. This is a very strong tissue used to fasten the muscle to other parts of the body. It does not stretch. Often a tendon fastens a muscle to a bone. For example, the muscle at the front of the upper part of the arm, known as the biceps, is fastened by a tendon to the bones of the lower part of the arm just below the elbow.\n[18] Chapter 16: Systems, Support, and Movement 585 Movement The works with the skeletal system to allow move-ment.

Flares generate heat and noise. Large flares can be quite. noisy because of the volume and velocity of the gas going through the flare stack. Because natural gas is valuable, companies would rather. capture than flare it.\n[4] Gas flaring, on the other hand, has been associated with reduced crop yield and plant growth on nearby farms, and disruption of wildlife in the immediate vicinity. Shell and other oil companies have developed an easy and inexpensive way to deal with by-products from oil drilling: indiscriminate dumping.\n[5] Flares deal with a variety of waste gas. compositions, depending on the type of plant. The mate-. rial released into a flare system is usually a hydrocarbon, or a mixture of constituents that can range from hydrogen.\n[6] Hosea 9:2 The threshing-floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail her.

The MERIT-HF trial compared metoprolol succinate to placebo and it was found that metoprolol succinate reduced the mortality rate by 34% in patients with heart failure.\n[3] Left ventricular dysfunction occurs when the left ventricle (the main pumping chamber of the heart) stiffens and enlarges and can cause the lungs to fill with blood. Carvedilol belongs to a group of medicines called beta-adrenergic blocking agents, beta-blocking agents, or more commonly, beta-blockers. Beta-blockers work by affecting the response to some nerve impulses in certain parts of the body.\n[4] It is usually best to take a lower dose initially when starting treatment with carvedilol. This allows time for your body to adjust to the new medication and decreases the risk of side effects. With the help of your doctor, you can then slowly increase the dose until your blood pressure is well managed.\n[5] CHOICE OF BETA BLOCKER. Carvedilol (Coreg), bisoprolol (Zebeta) and metoprolol succinate (Toprol XL) have all been shown to be beneficial in patients with chronic heart failure. At present, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has labeled only carvedilol for use in slowing the progression of chronic heart failure.atients with severe heart failure, especially inotrope-dependent and hospitalized patients, and those with hypotension, bradycardia or higher than first-degree heart block are not considered appropriate candidates for beta blocker therapy. Optimal diuresis is essential for maximal tolerability.\n[6] A: The prescribing information for carvedilol indicates that it can cause hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) in 5-12% of patients.

Metoprolol is a \u03b2 1 -selective agent, whereas carvedilol combines nonselective blockade of \u03b2-receptors with blockade of \u03b1-receptors and antioxidant effects.espite current treatments, including use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, digoxin, and diuretics, morbidity and mortality remain alarmingly high. An estimated 50% of patients with severe signs and symptoms of heart failure will die within 1 year and 70% within 3 years.\n[3] COREG (carvedilol) is indicated for the treatment of mild-to-severe chronic heart failure of ischemic or cardiomyopathic origin, usually in addition to diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and digitalis, to increase survival and, also, to reduce the risk of hospitalization [see DRUG INTERACTIONS and Clinical Studies ].rior to initiation of COREG (carvedilol) , it is recommended that fluid retention be minimized.

Several trials have documented a survival benefit for patients on long-term beta-blockers.An increase in ejection fraction between 2 and 4 months after initiation of therapy is seen consistently with beta blockers used in patients with systolic heart failure (Figure 8).Carvedilol therapy (Figure 9) in the US Carvedilol Trial was associated with a 65% reduction in mortality.HENTOLAMINE. A reversible nonselective alpha blocker that has a predominant effect on the arteriolar vascular bed.

Report signs/symptoms of heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, bronchospasm, hepatotoxicity, hypotension, syncope, or exacerbation of angina with initial dosing and dose changes. Avoid alcohol. Avoid abrupt discontinuation, may cause rebound hypertension.\n[6] Carvedilol also blocks alpha receptors, which are found on blood vessels, and relaxes the blood vessels, dilating them, which lowers blood pressure and vascular resistance. It is a nonselective beta blocker/alpha-1 blocker and belongs to the third generation of beta blockers.\n[7] Carvedilol Dosage for High Blood Pressure The recommended starting carvedilol dose for people with high blood pressure (hypertension) is 6.25 mg, taken twice a day. After a couple of weeks, based on the blood pressure response and/or carvedilol side effects, the dosage may be increased or decreased.\n[8] Coreg (carvedilol) is a beta-blocker.

Overview of Carvedilol for Canines. Carvedilol, commonly known as Coreg\u00ae, is a multiple-action cardiovascular agent that is further categorized as a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist and a vasodilator. At high dosages, carvedilol exerts calcium channel blocking activity. Because of carvedilol's afterload-reducing properties and the fact that it has fewer negative chronotropic and inotropic effects than other beta blockers, it is potentially a useful treatment for heart failure.\n[6] GENERIC NAME: carvedilol.

If your free T4 levels are too low\u2014the normal range for T4 is 5 to 13.5 micrograms per deciliter\u2014it's a possible indicator that you have hypothyroidism, even if your previous TSH tests came back normal.Again, the normal ranges vary from lab to lab. Anti-thyroid Microsomal Antibodies Testing.SH Testing. In diagnosing hypothyroidism, your doctor will take into account both your symptoms and the results of a thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) test. In essence, hypothyroidism is the result of diminished levels of thyroid hormones\u2014known as T3 and T4.\n[2] Therefore a high TSH level suggests an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism), while a low TSH indicates too much thyroid hormone in the body (hyperthyroidism). In my post \"Miscarriage in New York City\u2026Be Thyroid Aware\" , I outlined the TSH ranges for pregnancy and provided trimester-specific ranges.\n[3] TSH Testing.

Low TSH, normal free T3 or T4 Low TSH and normal free T3 and T4 test results areusually seen with thyroxine ingestion (panel 3).\n[5] The test measures your body's response to the thyroid hormone level in your blood. Your body's pituitary gland controls the activity of your thyroid gland by producing thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). A high TSH level means that your thyroid gland is underactive.\n[6] Low TSH and high FT4 levels are usually seen in people with a condition called hyperthyroidism, the end result of an overactive thyroid gland. Low TSH levels can also indicate that the pituitary gland itself is damaged; however, this is very rare.\n[7] Yes: A low TSH usually means that you are have a high level of thyroid hormone in your system and hyperthyroidism can be associated with hair loss. Usually the hair becomes softer and finer with hyperthyroidism as opposed to the hair loss with hypothyroidism which is usually associated with ...Read more.\n[8] It measures how much of the thyroid hormone thyroxine (T4) the thyroid gland is being asked to make. An abnormally high TSH means hypothyroidism: the thyroid gland is being asked to make more T4 because there isn't enough T4 in the blood.\n[9] 1 Abnormal TSH levels together with normal FT4 levels indicate you may be at risk of developing a thyroid disorder. 2 A low TSH level together with a low FT4 level can indicate a disorder of the pituitary gland. Thyroid function tests can be influenced by medications and illnesses.\n[10] TSH tells the thyroid how much thyroid hormone should be produced. TSH is the best test to evaluate the overall functioning of the thyroid. So if the TSH value is below normal, that means the thyroid is producing too much thyroid hormone and if the TSH level is above normal, there is not enough T4, T3, and free T4.\n[11] If the TSH is too high you have a condition called hypothyroidism, or an under-functioning thyroid gland. If it's extremely low, you have an overactive thyroid gland, or hyperthyroidism.\n[12] If you have hypothyroidism, it means you have a sluggish or underactive thyroid, which is producing less than adequate amounts of thyroid hormone. The latest estimates suggest that 20 million Americans have hypothyroidism, but the actual numbers are probably higher.\n[13] Out of Gas. Sometimes the thyroid can't meet your body's demands for thyroid hormone, even though TSH levels increase. As your body slows down, you may feel cold, tired and even depressed. You may gain weight, even though you're eating less. There could be a number of reasons why your thyroid is not performing well.\n[14] Sounds like you have a lot of typical hypothyroid symptoms, but your doctor is focused on TSH as the diagnostic and tells you that your thyroid tests are normal and symptoms can't be thyroid related. Wrong. Your Free T4 result was in the very low end of its range, I am sure.\n[15] What does a high TSH mean? High levels of TSH in the blood stream typically signal that the thyroid is underperforming. High TSH levels are a common signal of hypothyroidism that will require medical treatment to avoid potential health risks. TSH or thyroid stimulating hormone is a hormone produced in the anterior pituitary gland. This is used to help stimulate the thyroid to produce triiodothyronine (T3) or thyroxine (T4), hormones that help stimulate the metabolism.\n[16] Second, if you have Hashimoto's, you lab results can swing between hypo and hyper, & your lab test may be representing the middle of the swing. The best way to use the TSH lab test is in diagnosing a pituitary problem, not a thyroid problem. A very low TSH with a low free T3 gives away a pituitary issue.VITAMIN D test: (25-hydroxy vitamin D) measures the level of the hormone vitamin \"D\", which plays a role in your immune system and other important actions.reators of the TSH lab test came up with a 'range' that supposedly corresponds with healthy thyroid function. So theoretically, if your TSH lab results are higher than the range, it would imply something is triggering your actual TSH to be a little too active in screaming at your thyroid.\n[17] Blood tests can measure your levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroid hormone (T4). You have hypothyroidism when you have high TSH and low T4 levels in your blood. In very early or mild hypothyroidism, TSH will be high but T4 may be normal.\n[18] Low thyroid (also referred to as sluggish thyroid, thyroid deficiency, and subclinical hypothyroidism) means that your thyroid gland is putting out less thyroid hormones than your body needs. This is a natural occurrence with aging. The thyroid gland produces a hormone called thyroxine, also known as T4.\n[19] * Problems with Cholesterol levels. * Osteoporosis. The list goes on but these are probably the most important and serious symptoms associated with low TSH numbers/ hypothyroidism. The best way to find out if you have a low functioning thyroid is by doing laboratory testing.Normally your TSH levels will fluctuate between 0.35 and 5.5. Problems with Cholesterol levels. * Osteoporosis. The list goes on but these are probably the most important and serious symptoms associated with low TSH numbers/ hypothyroidism. The best way to find out if you have a low functioning thyroid is by doing laboratory testing.\n[20] TSH is secreted by the pituitary gland in the brain to stimulate the thyroid gland to produce its hormones, your number is low though, meaning that your thyroid may be producing more hormones.

Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: what does it mean if your tsh is low.\n\n[1] A TSH test is a lab test that analyzes your blood to determine the body's overall TSH levels. If you begin to show signs of a malfunctioning thyroid your doctor my order a test to check for the TSH levels in your system. If these show a high level of TSH you may have a sluggish thyroid, but low levels of TSH signal that your thyroid may be overactive.\n[2] The higher your TSH levels are, the more likely it is you have an underactive thyroid or hypothyroidism. Your pituitary increases TSH as a way to stimulate your thyroid gland to make enough thyroid hormone. If you have enough thyroid hormone it does not need to secrete a stimulus for the thyroid to make more hormones.\n[3] It's difficult for many patients to understand how low TSH levels are connected to the unpleasant physical signs and symptoms they've described to their doctor. The amount of thyroid-stimulating hormone, or TSH, present in your bloodstream has a direct link to thyroid function--and your overall metabolism.\n[4] 1 of 3 things: Hi. If your TSH is 0.344, which is just slightly below the normal range, it could be: 1) normal, no thyroid disease (the normal range EXCLUDES 5% of normal values), 2) mildly hot (autonomously hyperfunctioning) nodule (s), or 3) your doctor checked it while it was heading down.\n[5] So if the TSH value is below normal, that means the thyroid is producing too much thyroid hormone and if the TSH level is above normal, there is not enough T4, T3, and free T4. Of course if there is disease in the pituitary, which is rare, then the T4, T3, and free T4 are the informative tests.\n[6] Therefore a high TSH level suggests an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism), while a low TSH indicates too much thyroid hormone in the body (hyperthyroidism). In my post \"Miscarriage in New York City\u2026Be Thyroid Aware\", I outlined the TSH ranges for pregnancy and provided trimester-specific ranges.\n[7] Hypothyroidism means your thyroid is not making enough thyroid hormone. The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck. It makes hormones that control the way your body uses energy. Having a low level of thyroid hormone affects your whole body.\n[8] The lowering of TSH means that your thyroid is no longer getting a message to release hormone, and thyroid hormone production will slow down. The TSH Reference Range. As of 2017, at most laboratories in the U.S. the official reference range for the TSH test runs from approximately 0.5 to 4.5 or 5.0 (mIU/L).\n[9] Low levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) indicate hyperthyroidism, a condition in which the thyroid... TSH stands for thyroid stimulating hormone and it is measured through a blood test to determine thyroid function.\n[10] LOW TSH HAS MANY CAUSES. A low serum TSH level, ie, less than 0.4 \u03bcIU/mL (\u03bcIU/mL = \u03bcU/mL = mIU/L = mU/L) can result from a variety of conditions that must be included in the differential diagnosis\u2014not just overt or subclinical hyperthyroidism (FIGURE 1). In diagnosing the correct cause, patience is a virtue.\n[11] What does a high TSH mean? High levels of TSH in the blood stream typically signal that the thyroid is underperforming. High TSH levels are a common signal of hypothyroidism that will require medical treatment to avoid potential health risks. TSH or thyroid stimulating hormone is a hormone produced in the anterior pituitary gland. This is used to help stimulate the thyroid to produce triiodothyronine (T3) or thyroxine (T4), hormones that help stimulate the metabolism.\n[12] Blood tests can measure your levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroid hormone (T4). You have hypothyroidism when you have high TSH and low T4 levels in your blood. In very early or mild hypothyroidism, TSH will be high but T4 may be normal.\n[13] The test measures your body's response to the thyroid hormone level in your blood. Your body's pituitary gland controls the activity of your thyroid gland by producing thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). A high TSH level means that your thyroid gland is underactive.\n[14] TSH tells the thyroid how much thyroid hormone should be produced. TSH is the best test to evaluate the overall functioning of the thyroid. So if the TSH value is below normal, that means the thyroid is producing too much thyroid hormone and if the TSH level is above normal, there is not enough T4, T3, and free T4.\n[15] TSH Testing. In diagnosing hypothyroidism, your doctor will take into account both your symptoms and the results of a thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) test. In essence, hypothyroidism is the result of diminished levels of thyroid hormones\u2014known as T3 and T4.f your free T4 levels are too low\u2014the normal range for T4 is 5 to 13.5 micrograms per deciliter\u2014it's a possible indicator that you have hypothyroidism, even if your previous TSH tests came back normal.\n[16] This leads to high levels of TSH and low levels of free T4. If your free T4 levels are too low\u2014the normal range for T4 is 5 to 13.5 micrograms per deciliter\u2014it's a possible indicator that you have hypothyroidism, even if your previous TSH tests came back normal.Again, the normal ranges vary from lab to lab.

In essence, hypothyroidism is the result of diminished levels of thyroid hormones\u2014known as T3 and T4.\n[17] Low TSH and high FT4 levels are usually seen in people with a condition called hyperthyroidism, the end result of an overactive thyroid gland. Low TSH levels can also indicate that the pituitary gland itself is damaged; however, this is very rare.\n[18] If the TSH is too high you have a condition called hypothyroidism, or an under-functioning thyroid gland. If it's extremely low, you have an overactive thyroid gland, or hyperthyroidism.\n[19] Low thyroid (also referred to as sluggish thyroid, thyroid deficiency, and subclinical hypothyroidism) means that your thyroid gland is putting out less thyroid hormones than your body needs. This is a natural occurrence with aging. The thyroid gland produces a hormone called thyroxine, also known as T4.\n[20] * Problems with Cholesterol levels. * Osteoporosis. The list goes on but these are probably the most important and serious symptoms associated with low TSH numbers/ hypothyroidism. The best way to find out if you have a low functioning thyroid is by doing laboratory testing.Normally your TSH levels will fluctuate between 0.35 and 5.5.

Low levels of the thyroid hormone in your blood will result in abnormal test results.t secretes thyroid hormones T3 and T4. These hormones help regulate your metabolism. The pituitary gland, located at the base of your brain, produces thyroid-stimulating hormones (TSH) that tell your thyroid gland to produce T3 and T4.\n[5] 3 doctors agreed: 1 Yes: A low TSH usually means that you are have a high level of thyroid hormone in your system and hyperthyroidism can be associated with hair loss. 2 Generally low: Tsh will lead to an increased tendency for hair to break due to poor protein in the hair shaft, but it's not true hair loss. 3 Wrong assumptions: Iron level not relevant.\n[6] Health care professionals usually check the amount of TSH in your blood first. TSH is a hormone made in the pituitary gland that tells the thyroid how much T4 and T3 to make. A high TSH level most often means you have hypothyroidism, or an underactive thyroid. This means that your thyroid isn't making enough hormone.\n[7] Signs and Symptoms of Low TSH Levels. Checking the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland is an organ in the neck that produces hormones that regulate important bodily functions, including metabolism. The thyroid is stimulated to produce its hormones by another hormone called thyroid stimulating hormone, or TSH. When thyroid hormone levels are abnormally high, producing a condition known as an overactive thyroid or hyperthyroidism, the TSH level is typically low.\n[8] In brief: Need to look at T3 (liothyronine) And free t4. Low tsh, depending on the sensitivity of the assay, indicates thyroid hyper-function. However, the suspected hyperthyroidism needs to be confirmed with high levels of T3 (liothyronine) and free t4. All lab tests need to be evaluated in the clinical context and it would be prudent to take up the issue with your doctor.\n[9] If you have a low body temperature that indicates that you have a low EXPRESSION of thyroid hormones which may be due to the inadequate CONVERSION and utilization of thyroid hormones. Normalizing your temperatures with diet, exercise, herbal, nutritional support and/or T3 therapy might help your symptoms.o me, a low body temperature is the best sign that you may not be getting enough thyroid stimulation to your cells. There are hundreds of medical references that indicate that the TSH is not a reliable indicator of tissue thyroid status.\n[10] Higher levels of TSH push the thyroid to produce more hormone. Low TSH levels mean the thyroid is producing more than enough hormone. TSH levels can change a great deal with minor increases and decreases in T4. This is a very tightly regulated feedback process between the pituitary and the thyroid gland.\n[11] What does a high TSH mean? High levels of TSH in the blood stream typically signal that the thyroid is underperforming. High TSH levels are a common signal of hypothyroidism that will require medical treatment to avoid potential health risks.

A low TSH level indicates an overactive thyroid, a possible cause of anxiety. A high TSH level is a sign of a failing thyroid, a problem called hypothyroidism.\n[2] Typically, if there is a low level of thyroid hormone in the body, the pituitary will increase production of TSH to stimulate the thyroid to produce more thyroid hormone. Therefore a high TSH level suggests an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism), while a low TSH indicates too much thyroid hormone in the body (hyperthyroidism).\n[3] Would help to know your T4 but with a TSH of 20 you probably have a mildly underactive thyroid - many causes but the most common is autoimmune thyroiditis. You may not have any symptoms of low thyroid with TSH of 20 but you should see an endocrinologist if you have not done so already.\n[4] Such low levels are not always necessary, but decreased T4 and TSH levels are an indication that T4 and RT3 levels are being well depleted (which is often the point of T3 therapy). Hyperthyroidism often causes very low TSH levels and symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Yet proper T3 therapy often causes very low TSH levels without symptoms of hyperthyroidism while providing normal temperatures and a decidedly euthyroid clinical state.\n[5] It makes thyroid-stimulating hormone, or TSH, which tells the thyroid gland how much T4 and T3 to produce. The TSH level in your blood reveals how much T4 your pituitary gland is asking your thyroid gland to make. If your TSH levels are abnormally high, it could mean you have an underactive thyroid, or hypothyroidism.\n[6] Using the typical reference range, a TSH under 0.5 (a low TSH) may be indicative of hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid), and a TSH over 4.5/5.0 (a high TSH) may indicate hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid.)\n[7] Whether high or low, an abnormal TSH indicates an excess or deficiency in the amount of thyroid hormone available to the body, but it does not indicate the reason why. An abnormal TSH test result is usually followed by additional testing to investigate the cause of the increase or decrease.\n[8] So your doctor basically uses the TSH to determine whether you're hypo (underactive thyroid) or hyper (overactive thyroid.) If the TSH level is very, very high it means that your thyroid hormone medication has to be increased.\n[9] Hypothyroidism means your thyroid is not making enough thyroid hormone. The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck. It makes hormones that control the way your body uses energy. Having a low level of thyroid hormone affects your whole body. It can make you feel tired and weak.\n[10] Sometimes the thyroid can't meet your body's demands for thyroid hormone, even though TSH levels increase.

A TSH test on tests to see if your pituitary gland is sending a message to your thyroid to make T4. There are many other problems down the line that are not diagnosed with a TSH test. All your temps are very low.\n[2] Low levels of T4 may indicate a few things: 1 It could mean that your pituitary gland is not functioning properly in signaling the thyroid gland to produce more T3 and T4 hormones. Some hypothyroid disorders may be caused by the mal-functioning of the pituitary gland.\n[3] Hi Sandy :) According to me, if your temp is low then your metabolic rate is low by definition. And if your TSH is normal then you might not be converting T4 to T3 properly. Any illness or physical stress can contribute to low body temperatures, and low body temps can contribute to ailments as well.\n[4] Get help from a doctor now \u203a. Yes: An elevated TSH indicates that your pituitary gland feels that your thyroid level is somewhat low. The fact that the T4 and T3 are normal means that the problem is still mild. If you have symptoms of an underactive thyroid, treatment with thyroid hormone is indicated.\n[5] Probably nothing: If you have low thyroid hormone you may run lower than normal body temps, as well as if you have been out in cold weather for a long time period. It would be helpful if you told us what your temperature was, and how you measured it. ...Read more.\n[6] LOW TSH suggests you are closer to HYPERthyroidism (overactive), and have too much thyroid hormone circulating. HIGH TSH suggests you are closer to HYPOthyroidism (underactive), and you don't have enough thyroid hormone circulating.\n[7] To: Ami1801. Yes, usually, if your TSH is too low and you feel hyper, a reduction in meds is indicated. Sometimes, after thyroid cancer, doctors like to keep TSH below 0.1 to lessen the chance of recurrence. TSH is very unreliable as an indicator of thyroid status.\n[8] A low TSH result indicates that the thyroid gland is overactive, and is producing too many hormones. A high TSH result is indicative of hypothyroidism, because the thyroid is not responding properly to the pituitary gland, and thus, is not creating enough hormones.\n[9] TSH is the main hormone tested by your doctor to determine if your thyroid gland is functioning properly. Too much TSH means the pituitary gland is trying to get a sluggish thyroid gland to work better. Too little means there is enough thyroxin in your body so TSH remains low until more is needed.\n[10] To me, a low body temperature is the best sign that you may not be getting enough thyroid stimulation to your cells. There are hundreds of medical references that indicate that the TSH is not a reliable indicator of tissue thyroid status.\n[11] A TSH test is a lab test that analyzes your blood to determine the body's overall TSH levels. If you begin to show signs of a malfunctioning thyroid your doctor my order a test to check for the TSH levels in your system. If these show a high level of TSH you may have a sluggish thyroid, but low levels of TSH signal that your thyroid may be overactive.\n[12] What does a high TSH mean? High levels of TSH in the blood stream typically signal that the thyroid is underperforming. High TSH levels are a common signal of hypothyroidism that will require medical treatment to avoid potential health risks. TSH or thyroid stimulating hormone is a hormone produced in the anterior pituitary gland. This is used to help stimulate the thyroid to produce triiodothyronine (T3) or thyroxine (T4), hormones that help stimulate the metabolism.\n[13] It makes thyroid-stimulating hormone, or TSH, which tells the thyroid gland how much T4 and T3 to produce. The TSH level in your blood reveals how much T4 your pituitary gland is asking your thyroid gland to make. If your TSH levels are abnormally high, it could mean you have an underactive thyroid, or hypothyroidism.\"TSH levels go in the opposite direction of your thyroid hormone,\" Dr. Doria-Medina explains.he TSH level in your blood reveals how much T4 your pituitary gland is asking your thyroid gland to make. If your TSH levels are abnormally high, it could mean you have an underactive thyroid, or hypothyroidism. \"TSH levels go in the opposite direction of your thyroid hormone,\" Dr. Doria-Medina explains.\n[14] If you're suffering from anxiety, a test of the TSH level in your blood will indicate whether there is a problem with your thyroid function. A low TSH level indicates an overactive thyroid, a possible cause of anxiety. A high TSH level is a sign of a failing thyroid, a problem called hypothyroidism.\n[15] Health care professionals usually check the amount of TSH in your blood first. TSH is a hormone made in the pituitary gland that tells the thyroid how much T4 and T3 to make. A high TSH level most often means you have hypothyroidism, or an underactive thyroid. This means that your thyroid isn't making enough hormone.\n[16] Blood tests can measure your levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroid hormone (T4). You have hypothyroidism when you have high TSH and low T4 levels in your blood. In very early or mild hypothyroidism, TSH will be high but T4 may be normal.\n[17] This leads to high levels of TSH and low levels of free T4. If your free T4 levels are too low\u2014the normal range for T4 is 5 to 13.5 micrograms per deciliter\u2014it's a possible indicator that you have hypothyroidism, even if your previous TSH tests came back normal.\n[18] This leads to high levels of TSH and low levels of free T4. If your free T4 levels are too low\u2014the normal range for T4 is 5 to 13.5 micrograms per deciliter\u2014it's a possible indicator that you have hypothyroidism, even if your previous TSH tests came back normal.Again, the normal ranges vary from lab to lab. Anti-thyroid Microsomal Antibodies Testing.SH Testing. In diagnosing hypothyroidism, your doctor will take into account both your symptoms and the results of a thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) test. In essence, hypothyroidism is the result of diminished levels of thyroid hormones\u2014known as T3 and T4.\n[19] Using the typical reference range, a TSH under 0.5 (a low TSH) may be indicative of hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid), and a TSH over 4.5/5.0 (a high TSH) may indicate hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid.)\n[20] It makes thyroid-stimulating hormone, or TSH, which tells the thyroid gland how much T4 and T3 to produce.

During a TSH test, your doctor will take a blood sample to check the hormone levels. A needle will be placed in a sterilized are of your arm, then attached to a tube to collect the blood.\n[2] If your TSH level is very low, the doctor may want to also check your T3 and T4 hormone levels as he or she works towards a diagnosis of Graves' disease. of T3 and T4 are needed to regulate your body's metabolism at the cellular level, so in the blood test, your doctor will be looking for abnormal levels.\n[3] on. Your thyroid is very important to regulate your activity levels. When you have a too high TSH level in your blood, you are often a very active person. If your TSH numbers are too low than you are probably not a very active person.Sometimes the levels are elevated above a certain threshold and that is when we call it hypothyroidism. The symptoms that are involve with Hypothyroid are very serious but the disease itself is hard to diagnose at first. Problems with Cholesterol levels. * Osteoporosis. The list goes on but these are probably the most important and serious symptoms associated with low TSH numbers/ hypothyroidism. The best way to find out if you have a low functioning thyroid is by doing laboratory testing.\n[4] So, when you've gone for a checkup, and your TSH comes in below normal (and your doctor does not have you on a suppressive dose of thyroid hormone), they may want to REDUCE your dosage of thyroid hormone, because levels below normal are considered potentially hyperthyroid (overactive.)\n[5] A high level of TSH and a low level of T4 in the blood could mean you have an underactive thyroid. If your test results show raised TSH but normal T4, you may be at risk of developing an underactive thyroid in the future.our GP may recommend that you have a repeat blood test every so often to see whether you eventually develop an underactive thyroid. Blood tests are also sometimes used for other measurements, such as checking the level of a hormone called triiodothyronine (T3).\n[6] And if your TSH test comes in above normal, some doctors will want to INCREASE your dosage of thyroid hormone, because levels above normal are considered potentially hypothyroid (underactive.) To recap: LOW TSH suggests you are closer to HYPERthyroidism (overactive), and have too much thyroid hormone circulating.\n[7] A low TSH result may indicate: 1 An overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) 2 Excessive amounts of thyroid hormone medication in those who are being treated for an underactive (or removed) thyroid gland.\n[8] If the TSH level is normal or low and serum free T 4 levels are low, this is suggestive of central hypothyroidism (not enough TSH or TRH secretion by the pituitary gland or hypothalamus). There may be other features of hypopituitarism, such as menstrual cycle abnormalities and adrenal insufficiency.\n[9] TSH levels in your bloodstream rise or fall depending on whether there is enough thyroid hormone in your system to meet your body's needs. Higher levels of TSH push the thyroid to produce more hormone. Low TSH levels mean the thyroid is producing more than enough hormone. TSH levels can change a great deal with minor increases and decreases in T4. This is a very tightly regulated feedback process between the pituitary and the thyroid gland.\n[10] This drop in TSH is the pituitary gland's attempt to return circulating T3 & T4 hormone levels to normal. Therefore, the TSH test results will show lower than normal TSH when the thyroid is overactive. So, in general, lower TSH levels equals an overactive thyroid; or hyperthyroidism.\n[11] TSH is the main hormone tested by your doctor to determine if your thyroid gland is functioning properly.

Even slight changes in TSH level could signify a serious health risk. The problem is that most patients and many physicians may not be aware that a change in thyroid prescription may change the TSH and pose serious health risks.\n[2] 1 Low TSH-Low TSH levels can be a sign that you are dealing with an overactive thyroid gland from conditions such as goiter, noncancerous tumors or Graves's disease. 2 The thyroid may also become overactive during the first trimester of pregnancy.\n[3] Conversely, a low TSH reflects either a low need or desire for thyroid hormone or a low tolerance for the thyroid hormone and is meant to reduce thyroid hormone production. An optimal value of TSH means the thyroid hormone levels match the body's energy needs and/or ability to utilize the energy.\n[4] There are 2 reasons that could be the cause behind your low TSH: 1 Your glands simply aren't producing enough; 2 Your thyroid gland is producing too much of the thyroid hormone which signals to your brain to stop producing anymore.\n[5] If you are NOT taking thyroid medication and you have a low TSH then that truly might be a sign that you are hyperthyroid or have a condition known as subclinical hyperthyroidism.

But that's not what I want to focus on here. Instead I want to spend time explaining what happens to your TSH when you are taking thyroid hormone.\n[7] Most providers would have you believe that a low TSH in the presence of taking thyroid medication is \u200ba sign of hyperthyroidism.

Remember, a low TSH is indicative of hyperthyroidism -- an overactive thyroid -- and a high TSH is indicative of hypothyroidism -- an underactive thyroid.\n[2] 1 A high TSH level means that your thyroid gland is underactive. When your thyroid gland is underactive and not producing enough thyroid hormone, your body produces more TSH to stimulate the gland and increase its activity. A low TSH level means that your thyroid gland is overactive.\n[3] If TSH is high, it typically means that your thyroid function is too low (hypothyroid). If TSH is low, then it generally means the thyroid is overactive (hyperthyroid.) Your doctor may also check levels of other thyroid hormones in your blood.\n[4] A high level of TSH and a low level of T4 in the blood could mean you have an underactive thyroid. If your test results show raised TSH but normal T4, you may be at risk of developing an underactive thyroid in the future.\n[5] What do low TSH levels mean? According to About.com, low levels of TSH, or thyroid-stimulating hormone, occur when the pituitary gland shuts down TSH production due to high levels of thyroid hormone in the blood. The low levels of TSH are the pituitary gland's attempt to keep thyroid hormone levels normal within the body. What are some symptoms associated with high TSH levels? According to WebMD, high TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) levels indicate an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism). Common symptoms include feeling weak, tired or depressed, sensitivity to cold, constipation, brittle nails, memory problems, and heavy or irregular periods.\n[6] What does a Low TSH Mean? Your thyroid gland is producing too much of the thyroid hormone which signals to your brain to stop producing anymore. Individuals who suffer from low TSH levels and high levels of T3 and T4 (the thyroid hormones) have a condition that is commonly referred to as hyperthyroidism.\n[7] If your blood test shows low TSH levels, you may have a common condition called hyperthyroidism, which is when your thyroid gland produces too much T3 and T4. Low levels of T3 and/or T4, however, can indicate a condition called hypothyroidism.t secretes thyroid hormones T3 and T4. These hormones help regulate your metabolism. The pituitary gland, located at the base of your brain, produces thyroid-stimulating hormones (TSH) that tell your thyroid gland to produce T3 and T4.\n[8] However, if an individual suffers from low TSH levels AND low levels of thyroid hormones, then it could mean that the pituitary gland (which is responsible for producing thyroid) is weak from disease or damaged.\n[9] It means that as you give someone thyroid hormone (especially T4) their pituitary gland will sense the thyroid hormone and drop the TSH in accordance. But your other tissues may NOT get the thyroid hormone. This results in patients who have a normal or low TSH but still have symptoms of hypothyroidism.\n[10] Low TSH Levels: What They Can Mean. Low TSH can indicate that there's an abundance of thyroid hormone being produced by the thyroid gland, so the pituitary gland sees no need to release TSH.\n[11] Conversely, a low TSH reflects either a low need or desire for thyroid hormone or a low tolerance for the thyroid hormone and is meant to reduce thyroid hormone production.

Caffeine is a chemical found in coffee, tea, cola, guarana, mate, and other products. Caffeine is most commonly used to improve mental alertness, but it has many other uses. Caffeine is used by mouth or rectally in combination with painkillers (such as aspirin and acetaminophen) and a chemical called ergotamine for treating migraineheadaches.\n[2] Neurotransmitter Transmission. All psychoactive drugs, including caffeine, achieve their effects by imitating or altering the release or uptake of neurotransmitters, the chemical messengers that direct how the neurons of the CNS interact with each other.y raising and adjusting serotonin levels, caffeine relieves depression, makes us more relaxed, alert, and energetic, and relieves migraine headaches. Neurotransmitters-Venn Diagram 2. The full story of caffeine's intricate mechanism of action is still only partially understood by pharmacologists and physicians.\n[3] the Take-Away. Narcotics are highly addictive and cause severe damage to the nervous system. Narcotics can temporarily dull the user's senses and cause them to want to sleep for an extended period of time. Narcotic pain-killers remain an effective treatment for people suffering from chronic pain conditions.\n[4] Naturally then, products made from these substances will contain caffeine. The products I refer to include coffee, tea, cocoa and chocolate. Moreover it is used as an additive to some drugs and some soft drinks (i.e. Jolt Cola, Coca Cola, Mountain Dew, Dr. Pepper).\n[5] Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant. It works by stimulating the brain. Caffeine is found naturally in foods and beverages such as coffee, tea, colas, energy and chocolate. Botanical sources of caffeine include kola nuts, guarana, and yerba mate.\n[6] Caffeine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant of the methylxanthine class of psychoactive drugs. It is the world's most widely consumed psychoactive drug, but unlike many other psychoactive substances, it is legal and unregulated in nearly all parts of the world.oxic doses, over 10 grams per day for an adult, are much higher than typical dose of under 500 milligrams per day. A cup of coffee contains 80\u2013175 mg of caffeine, depending on what bean (seed) is used and how it is prepared (e.g. drip, percolation, or espresso).\n[7] All psychoactive drugs, including caffeine, achieve their effects by imitating or altering the release or uptake of neurotransmitters, the chemical messengers that direct how the neurons of the CNS interact with each other.\n[8] But scientists have learned that, largely as a consequence of its blockade of adenosine receptors, caffeine also has profound effects on most of the other major neurotransmitters, including dopamine, acetylcholine, serotonin, and, in high doses, on norepinephrine.y raising and adjusting serotonin levels, caffeine relieves depression, makes us more relaxed, alert, and energetic, and relieves migraine headaches.

The full story of caffeine's intricate mechanism of action is still only partially understood by pharmacologists and physicians.\n[9] Whether it is a steaming mug of morning Joe or an afternoon pick-me-up soda, the world is addicted to caffeinated comforts. According to a study conducted by New Scientist magazine, 90% of North American adults consume some form of caffeine on a daily basis, making this legal, psychoactive substance the world's most widely used drug. But to what extent is draining that caf\u00e9 latte from Starbucks an exercise in sinfulness?\n[10] The scientific name for caffeine is 1,3,7-trimethylxanthine. Caffeine is considered to be the most commonly used psychoactive drug in the world. Coffee, soda, and tea are the most common sources of caffeine in the American diet. Discontinuation of regular caffeine use may produce withdrawal symptoms. The effects of caffeine persist for about three hours or less. Caffeine is found in some combination medications and weight control products.\n[11] Caffeine found in tea, coffee, and other foods and drinks, is a drug, an alkaloid, related to some of the most violent of poisons. When it enters the human body, it produces at first a feeling of stimulation, followed in due course by a period of depression, relief from which is sought by the use of more caffeine.\n[12] Studies show that most people do not realize that caffeine is a drug, but it has some of the same negative qualities as other substances that are abused. Caffeine is most commonly consumed through liquids such as coffee, tea, energy drinks and soft drinks. It can also be obtained in pill form, powder or candy.he substance can be found in fruit, leaves and seeds. In certain plants it acts as a natural pesticide that kills insects who trying feeding on the vegetation. Research shows that most caffeine consumed by humans is extracted from the bean of the coffee plant and the leaves of the teach bush.\n[13] Caffeine is a stimulant obtained from over 60 different types of plants worldwide. The scientific name for caffeine is 1,3,7-trimethylxanthine. Caffeine is considered to be the most commonly used psychoactive drug in the world.

Uncoated aspirin tablets, consisting of about 90% acetylsalicylic acid, along with a minor amount of inert fillers and binders.\n[15] Caffeine is a stimulant to the central nervous system, and regular use of caffeine does cause mild physical dependence. But caffeine doesn't threaten your physical, social, or economic health the way addictive drugs do. (Although after seeing your monthly spending at the coffee shop, you might disagree!).affeine content can range from as much as 160 milligrams in some energy drinks to as little as 4 milligrams in a 1-ounce serving of chocolate-flavored syrup. Even decaffeinated coffee isn't completely free of caffeine. Caffeine is also present in some over-the-counter pain relievers, cold medications, and diet pills.\n[16] There is no nutritional need for caffeine. It can be avoided in the diet. Caffeine stimulates, or excites, the brain and nervous system. It will not reduce the effects of alcohol, although many people still believe a cup of coffee will help a person sober-up.. Caffeine may be used for the short-term relief of fatigue or drowsiness.\n[17] unit 3C: Caffeine. Summary of Chapter 11 Information. More people use caffeine on a daily basis than any other psychoactive drug. Caffeine belongs to a class of compounds known as xanthines, which are the oldest known stimulants.\n[18] Finally, caffeine can be considered a drug of abuse. It has positive reinforcing actions, produces tolerance, and a withdrawal syndrome after stopping its consumption.

While coffee is the substance (read beverage) that is consumed by people as an energy drink that contains caffeine, the most popular source of nicotine intake is cigarette. Both drugs have effects that are described differently by those who are used to them.\n[2] Caffeine activates noradrenaline neurons and seems to affect the local release of dopamine. Many of the alerting effects of caffeine may be related to the action of the methylxanthine on serotonin neurons. The methylxanthine induces dose-response increases in locomotor activity in animals.\n[3] Caffeine's stimulant effect on the central nervous system is dose-dependent; the more caffeine consumed, the stronger the stimulant effect. It blocks a neurotransmitter called adenosine, which is a central nervous system depressant and has a calming, slowing effect on the brain.\n[4] Caffeine is a naturally occurring psychoactive substance with stimulant properties. Caffeine use is common, and It is the world's most popular psychoactive drug, and it is completely freely available and unregulated in the United States and throughout much of the globe.\n[5] These days, that kind of addiction is called caffeinism. It can result in lots of not-fun effects, including nervousness, irritability, anxiety, insomnia, headaches, heart palpitations, ulcers, esophagitis, muscle twitching, and respiratory alkalosis. 5. Lewis Carroll-Opium.\n[6] \"We already knew that caffeine is a stimulant and can keep you awake and make it difficult to fall asleep at night if taken too close to bedtime,\" said behavioral neurologist Charmane Eastman of Rush University in Chicago, who was not involved in the work.\n[7] Caffeine is the only drug that is present naturally or added to widely consumed foods (quinine is the other drug used in foods). It is mildly addictive, one possible reason that makers of soft drinks add it to their products. Many coffee drinkers experience withdrawal symptoms, such as headaches, irritability, sleepiness, and lethargy, when they stop drinking coffee. Like any drug, the effects of caffeine on the body are not wholly good or bad. But exactly how much caffeine is there in the food and beverages you consume?\n[8] Caffeine is a central nervous stimulant. Considered the most widely used psychoactive drug in the world, caffeine is also considered by some to be the most widely abused drug in the world. Here are some of the effects of caffeine on the central nervous system.\n[9] Caffeine is not only found in beverages like coffee, tea and soft drinks, but is also an ingredient added to chocolate bars and some non-prescription drugs like Pain Relievers (Excedrin), Cold Remedies (Lemsip Max) and Stimulants (No Doz).\n[10] More people use caffeine on a daily basis than any other psychoactive drug. Caffeine belongs to a class of compounds known as xanthines, which are the oldest known stimulants. Other closely related xanthines are theophylline and theobromine. Three plants containing xanthines have been used by humans for thousands of years.\n[11] the Take-Away. Narcotics are highly addictive and cause severe damage to the nervous system. Narcotics can temporarily dull the user's senses and cause them to want to sleep for an extended period of time. Narcotic pain-killers remain an effective treatment for people suffering from chronic pain conditions.\n[12] The evidence is overwhelming that caffeine, a psychoactive drug, can exacerbate or cause anxiety.

Many people only get through college by using it to stay awake studying.\n[8] the popular conception of caffeine is that it gives you scot free energy but the reality is more complicated throughout the day your brain produces a neurotransmitter called adenosine when it binds to adenosine receptors in your neurons nerve activity in the brain slows down and you start feeling drowsy to a nerve cell caffeine looks just like adenosine which means caffeine can bind to a neuron s adenosine receptor\n[9] Technically, caffeine (xanthines in general) are nonselective antagonists of adenosine receptors A1 and A2A i.e. they have a stimulating effect. Agonists of the 4 adenosine receptors will produce a (broadly speaking) sedating effect. Another interesting action of caffeine is secondarily on the Dopamine pathway. When dopamine binds to postsynaptic receptors, intracellular cyclic AMP is released.\n[10] It will be important for future work to examine caffeine's effect on tasks thought to require NoGo pathway activity. A variety of other chemicals may work on the A2 receptor in similar (SCH 58261, ZM 241385, CSC, KF17837) or opposing ways (CGS 21680, APEC, 2HE-NECA).\n[11] The evidence is overwhelming that caffeine, a psychoactive drug, can exacerbate or cause anxiety.

Caffeine, chemically known as 1,3,7-trimethylxanthine, is considered to be the most popular, largely unregulated drug in the world. Caffeine is consumed in coffee, tea, cocoa, chocolate, many soft drinks and some drugs. Natural sources of caffeine include coffee beans, tea leaves, kola nuts, guarana berries and cacao pods. Like every drug, caffeine affects the nervous system in multiple ways, some of which are desirable, but many of which are unwanted.\n[8] Caffeine is a CNS stimulant that is used with pain relievers to increase their effect. It has also been used for migraine headaches. However, caffeine can also cause physical dependence when it is used for a long time. This may lead to withdrawal (rebound) headaches when you stop taking it.\n[9] Overall, caffeine is found in the beans, leaves, and fruit of over 60 plants, where it acts as a natural pesticide that paralyzes and kills certain insects feeding upon them. Caffeine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant, having the effect of temporarily warding off drowsiness and restoring alertness. Beverages containing caffeine, such as coffee, tea, soft drinks and energy drinks enjoy great popularity: caffeine is the world's most widely consumed psychoactive substance.\n[10] Caffeine dependence. Caffeine is a commonplace central nervous system stimulant drug which occurs in nature as part of the coffee, tea, yerba mate and other plants. It is also an additive in many consumer products, most notably beverages advertised as energy drinks.affeine is also added to sodas such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi, where, on the ingredients listing, it is designated as a flavoring agent. Caffeine's mechanism of action is somewhat different from that of cocaine and the substituted amphetamines. Caffeine blocks adenosine receptors A and A2A.\n[11] Cocaine and meth are not narcotics. They are stimulants, the exact opposite of a narcotic. They cause people to be more awake and more active, not sleepy. Calling them :narcotics makes as much sense as calling coffee a narcotic.\n[12] The evidence is overwhelming that caffeine, a psychoactive drug, can exacerbate or cause anxiety. Caffeine causes anxiety by many mechanisms \u2014 increasing stress hormones, reducing calming neurotransmitters, causing reactive hypoglycemia, depleting nutrients, and reducing blood flow to the brain.\n[13] Caffeine's Addictive properties. One of the difficulties with caffeine is that most people don't think of it as a drug in the same way that they think of nicotine or alcohol. But the morning coffee that \"gets us going\" has the same effect as any drug \u2013 the overnight lack of caffeine creates withdrawal symptoms.\n[14] Like narcotics, alcohol, or cigarettes, coffee and caffeinated beverages are addictive, destructive drugs that each year predispose millions of Americans to crippling illnesses and sometimes fatal diseases. Coffee and tea are the two most popular beverages in America. Coffee is America's number one drug problem.\n[15] Caffeine vs Nicotine. Caffeine and nicotine are two of the most commonly abused drugs in various forms. While coffee is the substance (read beverage) that is consumed by people as an energy drink that contains caffeine, the most popular source of nicotine intake is cigarette. Both drugs have effects that are described differently by those who are used to them.\n[16] Caffeine found in tea, coffee, and other foods and drinks, is a drug, an alkaloid, related to some of the most violent of poisons. When it enters the human body, it produces at first a feeling of stimulation, followed in due course by a period of depression, relief from which is sought by the use of more caffeine.\n[17] Photo by Refracted Moments\u2122I have believed for a long time that caffeine is worse for you than alcohol or tobacco. It is just as addictive, and it is not a controlled substance. We seem to force feed it to our kids. Many people only get through college by using it to stay awake studying.\n[18] Finally, caffeine can be considered a drug of abuse. It has positive reinforcing actions, produces tolerance, and a withdrawal syndrome after stopping its consumption. Caffeine can cause different mental disorders such as dependence, which is not included in the DSM-IV-R, withdrawal syndrome and intoxication.Depending on its use, caffeine can be considered a nutrient, a drug or a drug of abuse.[PubMed-indexed for MEDLINE].affeine can cause different mental disorders such as dependence, which is not included in the DSM-IV-R, withdrawal syndrome and intoxication.

The stimulant effect of coffee comes largely from the way it acts on the adenosine receptors in the neural membrane. Adenosine is a central nervous system neuromodulator that has specific receptors. When adenosine binds to its receptors, neural activity slows down, and you feel sleepy.\n[3] Summary of Chapter 11 Information. More people use caffeine on a daily basis than any other psychoactive drug. Caffeine belongs to a class of compounds known as xanthines, which are the oldest known stimulants. Other closely related xanthines are theophylline and theobromine.\n[4] Caffeine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant of the methylxanthine class. It is the world's most widely consumed psychoactive drug. Unlike many other psychoactive substances, it is legal and unregulated in nearly all parts of the world.\n[5] Sources of caffeine include preparations sold to assist in fitness and sporting performance, energy drinks, soft drinks, various medicines, herbal tonics containing guarana, as well as coffee, tea and chocolate. Caffeine overdose can cause nausea, diarrhoea, light-headedness and urinary frequency.Caffeine withdrawal even after moderate chronic intake may be associated with headache, nausea, nervousness, reduced alertness and depressed mood.Symptoms are most acute in the first 20-48 hours but they may persist for as long as seven days.affeine withdrawal even after moderate chronic intake may be associated with headache, nausea, nervousness, reduced alertness and depressed mood. Symptoms are most acute in the first 20-48 hours but they may persist for as long as seven days.\n[6] Natural caffeine is no better than synthetic. It's really the same chemical, whether it's carved away from an ingredient in which caffeine naturally exists, such as guarana or kola nuts, or it's cobbled together in a laboratory, Carpenter says. Synthetic caffeine is cheaper and much more widely used.\n[7] Caffeine has a stimulating effect on the central nervous system, heart, blood vessels, and kidneys. It also acts as a mild diuretic. Caffeine's potent stimulatory action makes it a valuable antidote to respiratory depression induced by drug overdose (e.g., from morphine or barbiturates).\n[8] Answer by Monica Lynch. Confidence votes 31. No. Neither is marijuana. A narcotic is a drug derived from opium or opiumlike compounds, with potent analgesic effects associated with significant alteration of mood and behavior, and with the potential for dependence and tolerance following repeated administration.\n[9] Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant. It works by stimulating the brain. Caffeine is found naturally in foods and beverages such as coffee, tea, colas, energy and chocolate. Botanical sources of caffeine include kola nuts, guarana, and yerba mate. Caffeine is also available in prescription and non-prescription medications. Caffeine is used to restore mental alertness or wakefulness during fatigue or drowsiness. Caffeine is also found in some headache and migraine medications, in certain dietary supplements used for weight loss, and in many popular energy drinks. Caffeine citrate is available by prescription only.\n[10] Coffee or tea, anyone? They might be two of our favourite drinks, but how many of us know exactly what caffeine \u2013 the drug behind the world's most consumed beverages (except for water) \u2013 is up to in the body? Caffeine, like nicotine, is legal, and, if not addictive, it's definitely habit-forming. Caffeine is found in a number of plants: tea, coffee beans, guarana berries and cocoa nuts (although the quantity is quite small, around 0.2-0.4 per cent), where it acts as a toxin to defend against herbivores.\n[11] Cocaine and meth are not narcotics.

It stimulates certain chemical systems in the brain and this keeps you awake. If you use it on a daily basis, you develop a tolerance, just as you would to pain pills or other drugs.\n[2] Caffeine may be the \"nootropic\" brain drug of choice in Silicon Valley, but an hour's drive north in Solano County, California, the stimulant could get you charged with driving under the influence. That is according to defense attorney Stacey Barrett, speaking on behalf of her client, Joseph Schwab.\n[3] EXTRA-STRENGTH EXCEDRIN: CAFFEINE WITH OTHER PAIN KILLERS. Caffeine is a potent pain killer. The relief it delivers to nociception, that is, pain perception, results from at least two distinct mechanisms: 1. Caffeine delivers pain relief by exerting so-called \"peripheral action,\" that is, relief at the site of an injury.\n[4] Caffeine may very well be the most frequently ingested neuroactive drug in the world. Mechanistically, caffeine has been reported to affect cell cycle function, induce programmed cell death or apoptosis and perturb key cell cycle regulatory proteins.\n[5] An opioid is sometimes called a narcotic. The combination of aspirin, butalbital, caffeine, and codeine is used to treat tension headaches. This medicine is not for treating headaches that come and go. This medication may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.\n[6] Caffeine is included in over-the-counter analgesics such as Excedrin (65 milligrams caffeine per tablet) and Anacin (32 milligrams caffeine per tablet). If you don't have an analgesic-plus-caffeine medication at home, you can add caffeine yourself by taking your over-the-counter analgesic with a caffeinated beverage.\n[7] Caffeine and Pain. When added to pain relievers, caffeine can bring significant relief. Caffeine is a powerful stimulant that affects the central nervous system and can help you stay alert. Many of us are slaves to the caffeine habit, maintaining a steady stream of coffee, tea, soda, or chocolate in an effort to push past fatigue.\n[8] What caffeine does do is one heck of an impersonation. In your brain, caffeine is the quintessential mimic of a neurochemical called adenosine. Adenosine is produced by neurons throughout the day as they fire, and as more of it is produced, the more your nervous system ratchets down.\n[9] Caffeine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant of the methylxanthine class of psychoactive drugs. It is the world's most widely consumed psychoactive drug, but unlike many other psychoactive substances, it is legal and unregulated in nearly all parts of the world.roducts containing caffeine are coffee, tea, soft drinks (colas), energy drinks, other beverages, chocolate, caffeine tablets, other oral products, and inhalation.\n[10] Caffeine may also increase the amount of epinephrine, also known as adrenaline, in your body. If you've ever drunk to much coffee, you may be familiar with the jitters, your heart racing, frequent trips to the bathroom and an upset stomach. These are all side effects of caffeine blocking adenosine. As with all drugs, too much of a good thing is a bad thing! CAFFEINE-FREE PAIN RELIEVERS. There are plenty of medications that don't have caffeine, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve). Some people are much more sensitive to caffeine than others, so I recommend taking something with caffeine during the evening hours only if you can tolerate the stimulant effect.\n[11] Cocaine and meth are not narcotics.

Caffeine. Caffeine, one of a class of chemicals known as the xanthines, is still prescribed occasionally by physicians. Xanthines (caffeine, theobromine, theophylline) can in varying degrees cause central nervous system stimulation and cardiac stimulation; they also act as mild diuretics.Combined with other drugs, caffeine is sometimes used for headache, particularly migraine, and in some pain remedies (for example, A-P-C capsules). Tobacco was discovered on Columbus's first voyage. Cocaine was found in large areas of South America. Caffeine and LSD-like drugs were found scattered all over the world. During the next two centuries, the Europeans not only adopted nicotine and caffeine but spread them everywhere.\n[4] Certain pain relievers contain caffeine, as the compound has been shown to increase drug effectiveness and help the body absorb the pain relieving drug more quickly. In humans, caffeine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant, having the effect of temporarily warding off drowsiness and restoring alertness.\n[5] Caffeine has been added to medications that contain aspirin, acetominophen and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) at least since the '60s, but it wasn't until the '80s that it was proven to be an adjuvant analgesic itself, meaning it assists in the pain-relieving process of the main active drug.\n[6] Since caffeine is an antagonist for the adenosine receptors, it tends to speed up nervous system activity in a dose-related manner. As a natural consequence of blocking the adenosine receptors, it can also influence the effects of other major neurotransmitters including acetylcholine, serotonin, and norepinephrine.\n[7] Therefore, narcotics are drugs that induce sleep.

Caffeine is a CNS stimulant, whose principal mechanism of action is a nonselective antagonist of adenosine receptors... therefore a non-specific adenosine receptor agonist might be the pharmacological opposite of caffeine. In the real world, perhaps a zombification drug?\n[9] Caffeine Myth No. 1: Caffeine Is Addictive. This one has some truth to it, depending on what you mean by addictive.. Caffeine is a stimulant to the central nervous system, and regular use of caffeine does cause mild physical dependence. But caffeine doesn't threaten your physical, social, or economic health the way addictive drugs do.\n[10] Caffeine is a stimulant that naturally occurs in tea, coffee, and cocoa. Plants create the compound through nitrogen metabolism and it acts as a natural pesticide. Caffeine technically classified as a psychoactive drug, due to its stimulating effects on the nervous system.\n[11] 7. It's believed that some 3 out of 4 regular caffeine users are actually addicted to the substance. 8. After addiction, withdrawal from the use of caffeine can cause mood swings and irritability, similar to the symptoms of withdrawing from a narcotic or alcohol.\n[12] Fioricet is a derivation of acetaminophen, butibital, and caffeine. The medication can be used with codine as well. Most narcotics are labeled as such because they are pot\u2026ent in its raw form. It is not considered a narcotic.\n[13] An opioid is sometimes called a narcotic. The combination of aspirin, butalbital, caffeine, and codeine is used to treat tension headaches. This medicine is not for treating headaches that come and go. This medication may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.\n[14] Codeine is an opioid pain medication. An opioid is sometimes called a narcotic. Acetaminophen is a less potent pain reliever that increases the effects of codeine. Butalbital is a barbiturate. It relaxes muscle contractions involved in a tension headache. Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant. It relaxes muscle contractions in blood vessels to improve blood flow.\n[15] Cocaine and meth are not narcotics. They are stimulants, the exact opposite of a narcotic. They cause people to be more awake and more active, not sleepy. Calling them :narcotics makes as much sense as calling coffee a narcotic.\n[16] If they tell you that marijuana, cocaine, and meth are narcotics then count them among the vast legions of totally clueless people on this subject. The word narcotic comes from the Greek word narkos, meaning sleep. Therefore, narcotics are drugs that induce sleep. Specifically, that means the opiates such as heroin, morphine and related drugs. This is the correct meaning, so you should accept no other. Cocaine and meth are not narcotics. They are stimulants, the exact opposite of a narcotic. They cause people to be more awake and more active, not sleepy. Calling them :narcotics makes as much sense as calling coffee a narcotic.\n[17] Caffeine's Addictive properties. One of the difficulties with caffeine is that most people don't think of it as a drug in the same way that they think of nicotine or alcohol. But the morning coffee that \"gets us going\" has the same effect as any drug \u2013 the overnight lack of caffeine creates withdrawal symptoms.\n[18] Like narcotics, alcohol, or cigarettes, coffee and caffeinated beverages are addictive, destructive drugs that each year predispose millions of Americans to crippling illnesses and sometimes fatal diseases. Coffee and tea are the two most popular beverages in America. Coffee is America's number one drug problem.\n[19] Coffee or tea, anyone? They might be two of our favourite drinks, but how many of us know exactly what caffeine \u2013 the drug behind the world's most consumed beverages (except for water) \u2013 is up to in the body? Caffeine, like nicotine, is legal, and, if not addictive, it's definitely habit-forming. Caffeine is found in a number of plants: tea, coffee beans, guarana berries and cocoa nuts (although the quantity is quite small, around 0.2-0.4 per cent), where it acts as a toxin to defend against herbivores.\n[20] Caffeine is a stimulant obtained from over 60 different types of plants worldwide. The scientific name for caffeine is 1,3,7-trimethylxanthine. Caffeine is considered to be the most commonly used psychoactive drug in the world. Coffee, soda, and tea are the most common sources of caffeine in the American diet. Discontinuation of regular caffeine use may produce withdrawal symptoms. The effects of caffeine persist for about three hours or less. Caffeine is found in some combination medications and weight control products.\nSearch Query: is caffeine an narcotic.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Granulation tissue is caused by the child's body attempting to fix the skin disrupted by the tube and usually it occurs as part of the wound healing process. Depending on it's stage it appears as a red, pink or randomly colored bumpy tissue formed on the surface around the tubes' stoma.\n[3] The formation of exuberant granulation tissue almost inevitably occurs during second-intention healing of limb wounds in horses. It can be described as an aberrant prolongation of the phase of granulation tissue formation, rather than the wound making a transition to contraction.\n[4] D, As granulation tissue matures, marginal epithelial cells migrate and proliferate over connective tissue base to form a scar. Contraction of skin around scar is the result of movement of epithelial cells toward center of wound in an attempt to close the defect.\n[5] The repair process restores tissue continuity by the deposition of repair (scar) tissue. This is initially granulation tissue which matures to form scar tissue. Repair tissue is a connective tissue distinct right from the onset in several ways from the connective tissue native to the site (Forrest 1983).\n[6] Vascular tissue, which carries blood, is essential and forms as a part of granulation tissue with the purpose of carrying a sufficient supply of blood to the newly forming tissue.

It should look less and less white every day. But, it will take longer than two days to heal. The area should be feeling better each day.\n[16] Weeks to months after onset of injury, granulation tissue is transformed into a mature scar.

Tissue granulation is a process by which fibrous tissue rich with blood capillaries replaces blood clots formed at the site of a healing wound. Through this process, healthy and normal skin is able to replace skin that was damaged.The tissue that forms over a wound during this process is called granulation tissue.The tissue that forms usually has a light pink color and a relatively rough texture; it is also quite moist and tends to be bumpy in appearance.issue granulation occurs in the proliferative phase, during which new, healthy tissue reforms and rebuilds the area of the wound. The final phase of wound healing is the remodeling phase, when the new tissue fully integrates with the old tissue.\n[3] Granulation tissue Granulation tissue itself is composed largely of newly growing capillaries (angiogenesis) and is so called because the irregular surface is created by the capillaries looping together on the wound surface, giving the appearance of red lumps (or granules) throughout paler pink normal matrix.\n[4] Granulation tissue is new connective tissue and tiny blood vessels that form on the surfaces of a wound during the healing process. Granulation tissue typically grows from the base of a wound and is able to fill wounds of almost any size.\n[5] Granulation tissue can be noted from the healthy wound buds that protrude from the wound base. During wound healing, granulation tissue usually appears during the proliferative phase. Angiogenesis is the process by which new blood vessels form, bringing in tiny capilarry buds that appear as granular tissue.\n[6] Granulation tissue is new connective tissue and tiny blood vessels that form on the surfaces of a wound during the healing process.

With these and other components, tissue granulation helps protect and rebuild broken skin. Ad.\n[10] Granulation tissue is collagen-rich tissue which forms at the site of an injury. As the body heals, this tissue fills in the injury, and may eventually scar over. The scar may fade over time, especially if the wound is small. In some cases, the body produces too much granulation tissue, in a condition known as proud flesh, in which case medical treatment may be required to halt the overproduction. The appearance of granulation tissue is a good sign. When a wound starts granulating, it means that the body is starting to rebuild after the injury. This highly fibrous tissue is usually pink because the body produces numerous small blood vessels to provide a supply of oxygen and nutrients to remove waste.\n[11] Granulation tissue is mostly composed of new blood vessels and fibroblasts and also tissue matrix due to which it can support different cell types. Fibroblasts is the main modifier of granulation tissue and at the start comprises of type III collagen network which is mostly weak.ranulation tissue is mostly composed of new blood vessels and fibroblasts and also tissue matrix due to which it can support different cell types.

Once the wound is free of debris and new blood vessels have begun to form, repair cells called fibroblasts lay down a scaffolding of collagen. This collagen network matures into granulation tissue, which forms the foundation of scars. Granulation tissue matures as collagen fibers become increasingly interlinked.\n[16] In the second wound healing stage, proliferation, the wound begins to be rebuilt with new, healthy granulation tissue. For the granulation tissue to be formed, the blood vessels must receive a sufficient supply of nutrients and oxygen.\n[17] Healthy granulation tissue is granular and uneven in texture; it does not bleed easily and is pink / red in colour. The colour and condition of the granulation tissue is often an indicator of how the wound is healing. Dark granulation tissue can be indicative of poor perfusion, ischaemia and / or infection.\n[18] Healthy granulation tissue is granular and uneven in texture; it does not bleed easily and is pink / red in colour.

Epithelial cells finally resurface the wound, a process known as 'epithelialisation'.\n[19] Granulation tissue sets the stage for epithelial tissue to be laid down on top of the wound bed. Pale unhealthy granulation tissue, as noted above, can result from lack of good blood supply and angiogenesis. Pale granulation tissue needs to be freshened up with debridement to stimulate new ingrowth of blood vessels.\n[20] Vascular tissue, which carries blood, is essential and forms as a part of granulation tissue with the purpose of carrying a sufficient supply of blood to the newly forming tissue.

By Timothy Kendall. In the 1820s, the Western world was thrilled to hear news of the rediscovery of the monuments of ancient Nubia - or Kush, as it was called in the Bible.\n[3] Back to Ancient Egypt for Kids. 1 Farmers-most of the people were farmers. 2 They grew barley to make bear, wheat for bread, vegetables such as onions and cucumbers, and flax to make into linen. 3 They grew their crops near the banks of the Nile River where the rich black soil was good for crops.ack to Ancient Egypt for Kids. 1 Farmers-most of the people were farmers. 2 They grew barley to make bear, wheat for bread, vegetables such as onions and cucumbers, and flax to make into linen. 3 They grew their crops near the banks of the Nile River where the rich black soil was good for crops.\n[4] For a thousand years, the lands south of the first cataract on the Nile River had been the source of gold for the Egyptian pharaohs. About 1520 BCE, the Egyptians took control of these southern lands, called Nubia or Kush. As Egypt's control over the area weakened, the Kingdom of Kush was established about 1070 BCE. Then, under the leadership of Piye (also called Piankhy), Kush moved north in 747 BCE and conquered Egypt.\n[5] Ptolemaic writers said that Egypt was formed of the mud carried down, from Ethiopia, that. p. 28. [paragraph continues] Ethiopians were the first men that ever lived, the only truly autochthonous race and the first to institute the worship of the gods and the rites of sacrifice.\n[6] Egypt is a country in North Africa, on the Mediterranean Sea, and is among the oldest civilizations on earth. The name 'Egypt' comes from the Greek Aegyptos which was the Greek pronunciation of the Egyptian name 'Hwt-Ka-Ptah' (which means House of the Spirit of Ptah, who was a very early God of the Ancient Egyptians).he great monuments which Egypt is still celebrated for reflect the depth and grandeur of Egyptian culture which influenced so many ancient civilizations, among them Greece and Rome. Evidence of overgrazing of cattle, on the land which is now the Sahara Desert, has been dated to about 8,000 BCE.\n[7] Around 5000 B.C., when the climate became more arid, nomadic groups retreated to the Nile Valley, creating the first urban settlements. These communities were concentrated in the North and the South. As a result, Egypt became known as the Double Land or the Two Lands of Upper and Lower Egypt. The two lands were united in 3100 B.C. by the legendary King Menes. He established a new administrative city where the Nile River branches out into the delta. In ancient times it was called White Walls or Mennefer; the Greeks called it Memphis. It remained the capital of Egypt for over 3,500 years.\n[8] The Egyptian population lived on both sides of the Nile valley and in the delta region. The ancient Egyptians had dark skin and dark hair. Most of them belonged to one of the three main classes. The upper class consisted of the pharaoh and his family, rich landowners, priests and doctors.he Nile River was the centre of Ancient Egypt. The annual floods brought rich black soil to the banks of the Nile River and made it possible for farmers to grow crops. The river was also Egypt's main transportation route. The ancient Egyptians discovered many things.\n[9] Passing southward, we find that ancient edifices occur throughout the whole extent of Ethiopia. The whole of the space between the Nile and Abyssinia, and northward to Lower Egypt once constituted Ethiopia. It was called Beled-es-Soudan (land of the blacks). Once Egypt extended to Lower Nubia. The ancient kingdom of Meroe was Upper Nubia and was divided into agricultural and grazing lands.\n[10] Why did the area the Nile River the most Densely populated are in the Ancient World?\n[11] Kemet and Sumer built great solar temples to the Ntcheru / Dinger.

That is because modern Egyptologists and others often mix the order of the hieroglyphs that the ancients wrote.\n[2] White was also the heraldic color of Upper Egypt. The Nefer, the crown of Upper Egypt was white, even though originally is was probably made of green reeds. The pure white color used in Egyptian art was created from chalk and gypsum. In ancient Egypt, black (kem) was a symbol of death and of the night. Osiris, the king of the afterlife was called the black one.. One of the few real-life people to be deified, Queen Ahmose-Nefertari was the patroness of the necropolis.\n[3] 1 The people in Ancient Egypt divided Egypt into two areas. 2 The 'red land' was the deserts protecting Egypt on two sides. 3 These deserts separated ancient Egypt from neighbouring countries and invading armies.\n[4] I am an Egyptologist with a Ph.D. so I suppose when I say I know my stuff somebody out there will have the good sense to believe me and not be guided by racist feelings. Ancient Egyptians were of a race we call today Hamitic. What does this mean: they were in part semitic in origin and partly black.Of course there was some white blood mix,but unlike one of the previous writers says this was the case mostly during the New Kingdom.here are Black Egyptians like there are Black Germans, but there are NO Black Indo European Aryan Whites, like there are NO Black Arab Semitic Whites.There are ONLY mixes as mentioned above.\n[5] The Ancient Egyptians were Arab Semitic White and the Nubians were making up the Southwestern 1/4 of Egypt(annexed part of Nubia in 1521 B.C. , was Black Nubian-whom many Afro centrists ERRONEOUSLY claim were the Ancient Egyptians.gypt was a composite of Asians and Africans After been invaded by the Greeks, Romans, Spanish, French, British for centuries, today arabs are a composite of Euros, Asians and Africans. All ancient Egyptians were a composite of Aaians/Africans.\n[6] Because they could grow their crops with the Nile River's help, and because they were able to built canals and boats there. What is now called Egypt was founded as a colony by Nubians, led by Asar, Egypt's first ruler, whom the ancient Greeks later called Osiris. After death he was deified and became a god. He was part of the history's first holy trinity featuring Aset and Heru, whom the Ancient Greeks later called Isis and Horus. Exploration was the reason these Nubians settled in what is now Egypt.\n[7] What were the ancient Egyptians? Were they black or were they white? Because of whitewashing in both popular culture and history classes, a lot of people tend to think they were white. Because they live in Africa (a continent, let's recall, which is substantially larger than Europe), other people assume they were black.hat's right, the ancient Egyptians weren't black. They weren't white either, mind you, but to presume that a culture has to be one or the other is to accept a racial dichotomy that white colonialists themselves invented for the purpose of sorting the world into civilized (white) and savage (colored) peoples.\n[8] Black was also used as a standard color for hair and to represent the skin colour of people from the south \u2013 Nubians and Kushites. White (Ancient Egyptian name 'hedj') was the color of purity, sacredness, cleanliness, and simplicity. Tools, sacred objects, and even priest's sandals were white for this reason.\n[9] In ancient Egypt, color was an integral part of the substance and being of everything in life. The color of something was a clue to the substance or heart of the matter.\n[10] Since 5,000 B.C.-the Egyptians have been Arab Semitic White.

After all, KMT, a name for ancient Egypt refers to its rich, dark, fertile soil and we have no doubt that since the invention of agriculture, Egyptians, with the Nile Valley and Delta, had a distinct advantage over many others when it came to food.\n[7] Ancient Egypt was a racially diverse place, because the Nile River drew people from all over the region.

They knew perfectly well that Nubians were black-skinned, as are the Sudanese of the same regions today.

These communities were concentrated in the North and the South. As a result, Egypt became known as the Double Land or the Two Lands of Upper and Lower Egypt. The two lands were united in 3100 B.C. by the legendary King Menes. He established a new administrative city where the Nile River branches out into the delta. In ancient times it was called White Walls or Mennefer; the Greeks called it Memphis.

A business strategy is different from a tactic in that different tactics may be deployed as part of a single strategy.\n[2] Save. Many companies have one overarching goal: to earn a profit and create a return for shareholders. To achieve their goals, corporations may own multiple business units in various industries. Business-level strategy is used to obtain a customer base and sell a product at a profit. Corporate-level strategy, on the other hand, is used when deciding what business units to sell and purchase, and how to integrate operations and find synergies between them.

A strategic plan, on the other hand, answers how will I do it? questions.\n[4] In the broadest sense, \"strategy\" is a plan for how to achieve a goal. In business, strategy bridges the gap between policy (guidelines governing action) and tactics (a set of techniques). Strategy is what a company develops to differentiate itself from competitors' actual or predicted moves.\n[5] Integrating a business strategy usually is one of many steps in a larger business planning process. A business plan begins with an overall vision. From the vision, a mission statement for the business is constructed, usually the shorter and more precise the better.\n[6] 1 Strategy is a plan, a how, a means of getting from here to there. 2 Strategy is a pattern in actions over time; for example, a company that regularly markets very expensive products is using a high end strategy.\n[7] The U.S. Small Business Administration refers to the business model as a company's foundation and the business plan as its structure. The foundation, or business model, is the original idea for your business and a general description of how it functions.\n[8] How NOT to Define a Business Model. Business model is one of those terms that takes on the meaning of its user, and we should begin with a clear understanding of what it is and isn't. We can't always be sure one person's business model isn't another's value proposition, business case, revenue model, strategy, and so on.

One of the primary differences between tactical and strategic intelligence is the time orientation of both intelligences, as they relate to a business environment.\n[10] Yet, in business terminology, the words strategy and tactics refer to separate business functions and practices. Strategy Sets the Stage In real world business usage, the term Strategy actually is the thinking process required to plan a change, course of action, or organization.\n[11] Adorable animal families that will make you aww. A business strategy typically is a document that clearly articulates the direction a business will pursue and the steps it will take to achieve its goals. In a standard business plan, the business strategy results from goals established to support the stated mission of the business. A typical business strategy is developed in three steps: analysis, integration and implementation.\n[12] And when business leaders conflate strategy, implementation, and execution, they usually end up with a lot of the trappings of running a modern-day company or business unit \u2014 such as goals and targets; plans and initiatives; and mission, vision, and purpose statements \u2014 but very little actual strategy, implementation, or execution.\n[13] The following are the major differences between strategy and policy. 1 The strategy is the best plan opted from a number of plans, in order to achieve the organisational goals and objectives. The policy is a set of common rules and regulations, which forms as a base to take the day to day decisions. The strategy is a plan of action while the policy is a principle of action.

A strategy is the overarching wisdom that coordinates all of the plans in order to effectively reach the goals. Remember, having a plan is essential, but developing a strategy should always come first.\n[18] Strategy refers to planning and goal setting to reach long-term and big-picture objectives, as opposed to tactics, which refers to the execution of strategies.

Who will be served, what needs have to be met, and how those needs will be satisfied are determined by the senior management.\n[2] Essentially, strategy involves planning a company's next move, and tactics involve physically carrying out the plan. The difference between the two concepts can be remembered with the phrase, strategic is doing the right things -- tactical is doing things right..\n[3] Mission is a business' reason for being -- its purpose. Vision is a company's ultimate accomplishment, the realization of the mission. All strategy tries to fulfill the vision, and the organizational structure should support that effort.

Strategy is position; that is, it reflects decisions to offer particular products or services in particular markets.\n[6] I would like to think there isn't a huge amount of difference between the two.

Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: what medium do radio waves travel through.\n\n[1] Though radio waves are often used to encode and transmit data that is eventually transformed into sound (similar to how sound is encoded and transmitted electrically), they are not sound waves themselves. Radio waves are electromagnetic waves and so they travel at the speed that all electromagnetic waves travel\u2014 the speed of light.\n[2] There are some general properties shared by all forms of electromagnetic radiation: It can travel through empty space. Other types of waves need some sort of medium to move through: water waves need liquid water and sound waves need some gas, liquid, or solid material to be heard.\n[3] The propagation speed of radio waves in free space is equal to the speed of light in a vacuum: c = 300,000 km/sec. When a radio wave propagates in a material medium such as the atmosphere, the upper layer of the earth, or seawater, its phase velocity is changed, and energy is absorbed.\n[4] Question 2 d) a medium. Mechanical waves are waves that propagate through a material medium. Question 3, a) AM/FM radio: The amplitude modulation and frequency modulation methods are analogue modulation methods.\n[5] The weak absorption of radio waves by the medium through which it passes is what enables radar sets to detect objects at relatively long ranges\u2014ranges at which other electromagnetic wavelengths, such as visible light, infrared light, and ultraviolet light, are too strongly attenuated.\n[6] Radio waves are longer than 1 mm. Since these are the longest waves, they have the lowest energy and are associated with the lowest temperatures. Radio wavelengths are found everywhere: in the background radiation of the universe, in interstellar clouds, and in the cool remnants of supernova explosions, to name a few.\n[7] Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation, as are microwaves, infrared radiation, X-rays and gamma-rays. The best-known use of radio waves is for communication; television, cellphones and radios all receive radio waves and convert them to mechanical vibrations in the speaker to create sound waves that can be heard. Electromagnetic radiation is transmitted in waves or particles at different wavelengths and frequencies.\n[8] Examples of electromagnetic waves traveling through space independent of matter are radio and television waves, microwaves, infrared rays, visible light, ultraviolet light, X-rays, and gamma rays. All of these waves travel at the same speed\u2014namely, the velocity of light (roughly 300,000 kilometres, or 186,000 miles, per second).\n[9] Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz, though some definitions describe waves above 1 or 3 GHz as microwaves, or include waves of any lower frequency. At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is 1 mm (0.039 in), and at 3 kHz is 100 km (62 mi).\n[10] Sound can travel through air, water, or solids, but it can't travel through a vacuum. It needs the medium to help it travel. Other examples include water waves, seismic waves, and waves traveling through a spring. Electromagnetic waves are waves that can travel through a vacuum (empty space). They don't need a medium or matter. They travel through electrical and magnetic fields that are generated by charged particles. Examples of electromagnetic waves include light, microwaves, radio waves, and X-rays.\n[11] When a wave moves from one medium into another, its direction of propagation changes; this is termed refraction. In addition to the transmitted wave continuing from one medium into another, there is also a reflected wave back into the original medium. For example, when your radio is playing music in your room, the sound waves pass through the walls as well as reflect from them. Similarly, some of the light from your lamp passes through the glass of the window in your room, and some also is reflected from the glass.\n[12] Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Like all other electromagnetic waves, they travel at the speed of light. Naturally occurring radio waves are made by lightning, or by certain astronomical objects.adio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Like all other electromagnetic waves, they travel at the speed of light. Naturally occurring radio waves are made by lightning, or by certain astronomical objects.\n[13] Radio waves travel at the speed of light. When passing through an object, they are slowed according to that object's permeability and permittivity. The wavelength is the distance from one peak of the wave's electric field to the next, and is inversely proportional to the frequency of the wave.\n[14] Radio waves form part of the electromagnetic spectrum (which includes all light). They therefore travel at the same speed as x rays, microwaves, and visible light, which is 18 \u2026 6 thousand miles per second or 3 million meters per second.\n[15] Sound is converted into EM waves and sent through radio dishes like this one. Your radio then receives these radio waves and changes them back into sound waves. Next on the spectrum are microwaves, a type of radio wave that are less than 11.8 inches long.\n[16] Microwaves and radio waves are used to communicate with satellites. Microwaves pass straight through the atmosphere and are suitable for communicating with distant geostationary satellites, while radio waves are suitable for communicating with satellites in low orbit. Radio waves and microwaves. Radio waves and microwaves are types of electromagnetic radiation. Both have communication uses. Radio waves are used to transmit television and radio programmes, while microwaves are used for mobile phones and Wi-Fi. However, they have different properties: Radio waves have longer wavelengths and are reflected by the ionosphere (part of the Earth's atmosphere). Microwaves have shorter wavelengths and pass through the Earth's atmosphere.\n[17] RF waves are electromagnetic waves (ie, microwaves, light, radio) and Ultrasonic waves are compression waves. Ultrasound physically moves a lot slower and requires a medium. RF, on the other hand, requires no medium... otherwise we wouldn't be able to have radio communication with astronauts.\n[18] It is much the same with radio waves. AM waves bounce off the very large structures involving charged particles in the ionosphere. The shorter wavelength FM waves are better able to see the 'holes' between the ions, and do not really reflect off the ionosphere except for a faint 'ghosting'.\n[19] Radio waves and microwaves. Radio waves and microwaves are types of electromagnetic radiation. Both have communication uses. Radio waves are used to transmit television and radio programmes, while microwaves are used for mobile phones and Wi-Fi. However, they have different properties: 1 Radio waves have longer wavelengths and are reflected by the ionosphere(part of the Earth's atmosphere). 2 Microwaves have shorter wavelengths and pass through the Earth's atmosphere.\n[20] How fast do radio waves travel? Radio waves travel at a velocity that is equal to the speed of light traveling in a vacuum, which is 186,282 miles per second. Top speed is only possible in empty space; passing through transparent liquids and solids like crystals cause waves to bend, which slows down their speed.

Each type of electromagnetic radiation has a characteristic range of wavelengths determined by the speed of light, 186,000 miles per second. Radio frequencies range from about 100 kHz to 300 GHz and have corresponding wavelengths of 3,000 meters to 1 millimeter. Satellite communications range from about 20 meters to the shortest radio wavelengths.\n[6] Radio and television broadcast stations transmit their signals via RF electromagnetic waves. Broadcast stations transmit at various RF frequencies, depending on the channel, ranging from about 550 kHz for AM radio up to about 800 MHz for some UHF television stations.\n[7] Radio waves transmit music, conversations, pictures and data invisibly through the air, often over millions of miles -- it happens every day in thousands of different ways!\n[8] Various frequencies of radio waves are used for television and FM and AM radio broadcasts, military communications, mobile phones, ham radio, wireless computer networks, and numerous other communications applications. Most radio waves pass freely through Earth's atmosphere.\n[9] What do the radio, TV, radio controlled cars, and cell phones all have in common? They all use invisible waves to transmit information.

Actually, radio waves travel very quickly through space. Radio waves are a kind of electromagnetic radiation, and thus they move at the speed of light. The speed of light is a little less than 300,000 km per second. At that speed, a beam of light could go around the Earth at the equator more then 7 times in a second. The reason that it takes so long for radio messages to travel in space is that space is mind-bogglingly big. The distances to be traveled are so great that even light or radio waves take a while getting there.\n[2] Why do radio waves travel at the speed of light and not sound? Radio waves are a form of electromagnetic radiation \u2013 the same phenomenon as light, X-rays and various other types of radiation, but with much longer wavelengths.\n[3] include the low-energy waves that are used to communicate over long distances through radio and television.(can carry sound waves) electromagnetic waves can travel through a vacuum; at 300,000,000 m/s\n[4] For electromagnetic waves, propagation may occur in a vacuum as well as in a material medium. Other wave types cannot propagate through a vacuum and need a transmission medium to exist.\n[5] The medium could be air, water, a spring, the Earth, or even people. A medium is any material through which a wave travels. Mechanical wave examples: sound; water waves; a pulse traveling on a spring; earthquakes; a \u2015people wave\u2016 in a football stadium. An electromagnetic wave is simply light of a visible or invisible wavelength.\n[6] Radio waves generally are utilized by antennas of appropriate size (according to the principle of resonance), with wavelengths ranging from hundreds of meters to about one millimeter. They are used for transmission of data, via modulation,television,mobile phones,wireless networking, Radio waves can be made to carry information by varying a combination of the amplitude, frequency, and phase of the wave within a frequency band.\n[7] Radio wave. Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz, though some definitions describe waves above 1 or 3 GHz as microwaves, or include waves of any lower frequency. At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is 1 mm (0.039 in), and at 3 kHz is 100 km (62 mi).\n[8] A medium is a substance or material that carries the wave.

USER: I will provide you with 20 passages, each indicated by a numerical identifier []. Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: what medium do radio waves travel through.\n\n[1] One is because of what I described above; the wavelength is about the same as ordinary object. Radio waves tend to exhibit diffraction, that is they can bend around objects that are near the same size as their wavelength. So, radio waves can go around objects in general. The other way radio waves interact with objects is by reflection. Radio waves can bounce off objects. Often when radio waves hit an object like a building for example it will do both, refract around the building and reflect off of it as well. Now finally to your question. The main thing that makes radio waves go through an object or reflect off of it is the electromagnetic nature of object itself. Most common building materials like wood, plaster, glass, brick, stones, cement, etc are very poor conductors of electricity. These materials are referred to as dielectric materials.\n[2] A medium is any material through which a wave travels. Mechanical wave examples: sound; water waves; a pulse traveling on a spring; earthquakes; a \u2015people wave\u2016 in a football stadium. An electromagnetic wave is simply light of a visible or invisible wavelength. Oscillating intertwined electric and magnetic fields comprise light.\n[3] am radio 600khz 1500khz cannot propagate in any normal tunnel because the wavelength is too long 500m 200m relative to the diameter and thus gets reflected at the entrance fm 100mhz 3m would propagate and it does for a while but then it suffers reflections multipath inside and reception turns to craponsider this you are driving through a tunnel listening to your am radio and a gps all of the sudden am radio has nothing but statics and your gps says reconnecting please hold you say to yourself this can t be happening because radio signal would move through the opening of the tunnel to reach your antennas\n[4] Rather, we are talking about the waves that transmit radio signals. The main difference between radio waves and sound waves is that radio waves are a type of electromagnetic wave that can travel when there is no medium, whereas sound waves are a type of mechanical wave that cannot travel if there is no medium. What are Radio Waves. Radio waves are electromagnetic waves. These are waves composed of electric and magnetic fields, which are oscillating at right angles to each other. The energy of an electromagnetic wave propagates at a direction at right angles to the oscillations in both the electric and magnetic fields.\n[5] Millimeter waves and light waves are of particular importance for communication between two space vehicles that are outside planetary atmospheres. Such waves provide the largest communication-channel capacity. Information on the propagation processes of radio waves in outer space is provided by radio astronomy. Underground and underwater radio communication. The earth's crust and the water of the seas and oceans have electrical conductivity \u03c3 and strongly absorb radio waves.\n[6] As per the medium, the waves can be differentiated as mechanical and electromagnetic waves. Electromagnetic waves are waves that have no medium to travel whereas mechanical waves need a medium for its transmission. Electromagnetic waves travel in a vacuum whereas mechanical waves do not. The mechanical waves need a medium like water, air, or anything for it to travel. The ripples made in a pool of water after a stone is thrown in the middle are an example of mechanical waves. Examples of electromagnetic waves include light and radio signals.\n[7] When you listen to your radio, use a mobile phone or watch TV, you are using a device that receives radio waves. Radio waves are a form of electromagnetic radiation, just like the visible light you are used to seeing with your eyes. The difference in radio waves is that they have a longer wavelength and are lower in frequency than visible light. They also carry less energy.\n[8] I can't see through my skin, but x-rays can easily pass through me, and gamma rays can fcking melt my brain and such. What accounts for the fact that both long-wavelength waves (radio) and short-wavelength waves (x-rays, etc.) can pass through solid objects, but medium-wavelength waves (visible light) cannot?\n[9] Radio waves. Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Radio waves have frequencies from 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz, and corresponding wavelengths from 1 millimeter to 100 kilometers.\n[10] In a similar manner, a wave medium is the substance that carries a wave (or disturbance) from one location to another. The wave medium is not the wave and it doesn't make the wave; it merely carries or transports the wave from its source to other locations. In the case of our slinky wave, the medium through that the wave travels is the slinky coils. In the case of a water wave in the ocean, the medium through which the wave travels is the ocean water. In the case of a sound wave moving from the church choir to the pews, the medium through which the sound wave travels is the air in the room. And in the case of the stadium wave, the medium through which the stadium wave travels is the fans that are in the stadium.\n[11] Sound can travel through air, water, or solids, but it can't travel through a vacuum. It needs the medium to help it travel. Other examples include water waves, seismic waves, and waves traveling through a spring.

Electromagnetic waves travel through a vacuum, or empty space as well as matter.\n[4] How does an electromagnetic wave travel through for example, the vacuum of space? I usually see that waves are explained using analogies with water, pieces of rope, the strings of a guitar, etc, but it seems to me that all those waves need a medium to propagate.\n[5] Radio Waves. Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation. A radio wave has a much longer wavelength than does visible light. We use radio waves extensively for communications. Radio waves have wavelengths as short as a few millimeters (tenths of inches) and as long as hundreds of kilometers (hundreds of miles). Visible light, for comparison, has wavelengths in the 400 to 700 nanometer range, about 5,000 times shorter than the shortest wavelength radio waves.\n[6] The gamma rays just pass through the spaces between and within atoms and molecules. They're small enough to do that. If your walls were made of pure lead, they'd have a little more trouble. The radio waves on the other hand are large enough to ignore the walls because they're too thin.\n[7] Provided by Kenan Fellows Program. Sound waves need to travel through a medium such as a solid, liquid, or gas. The sound waves move through each of these mediums by vibrating the molecules in the matter. The molecules in solids are packed very tightly. Liquids are not packed as tightly as solids.\n[8] Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic (EM) radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light .

Let's contrast that with a mechanical wave.\n[2] Radio waves, like all electromagnetic waves, propagate at the speed of light, carrying an equal balance of electric and magnetic energy. The ratio between the electric and magnetic intensity of waves propagating in free space is a fundamental physical constant called the free space impedance.\n[3] Shortwave radio is radio transmission using shortwave frequencies, generally 1.6\u201330 MHz (187.4\u201310.0 m), just above the medium wave AM broadcast band. Radio waves in this band can be reflected or refracted from a layer of electrically charged atoms in the atmosphere called the ionosphere.\n[4] In the case of a water wave in the ocean, the medium through which the wave travels is the ocean water. In the case of a sound wave moving from the church choir to the pews, the medium through which the sound wave travels is the air in the room.\n[5] It has to travel through a medium. This is usually air, but could be any material such as water or steel. Mechanical waves cannot travel through vacuums as EM waves \u2026 can x. 3 people found this useful.\n[6] Radio Waves. Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation. A radio wave has a much longer wavelength than does visible light. We use radio waves extensively for communications. Radio waves have wavelengths as short as a few millimeters (tenths of inches) and as long as hundreds of kilometers (hundreds of miles).\n[7] Actually, radio waves travel very quickly through space. Radio waves are a kind of electromagnetic radiation, and thus they move at the speed of light. The speed of light is a little less than 300,000 km per second. At that speed, a beam of light could go around the Earth at the equator more then 7 times in a second. The reason that it takes so long for radio messages to travel in space is that space is mind-bogglingly big. The distances to be traveled are so great that even light or radio waves take a while getting there. It takes around eight minutes for radio waves to travel from the Earth to the Sun, and four years to get from here to the nearest star.\n[8] Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Radio waves have frequencies from 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz, and corresponding wavelengths ranging from 1 millimeter (0.039 in) to 100 kilometers (62 mi). Like all other electromagnetic waves, they travel at the speed of light. Naturally occurring radio waves are made by lightning, or by astronomical objects.\n[9] Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light.

The main difference between radio waves and sound waves is that radio waves are a type of electromagnetic wave that can travel when there is no medium, whereas sound waves are a type of mechanical wave that cannot travel if there is no medium. What are Radio Waves. Radio waves are electromagnetic waves. These are waves composed of electric and magnetic fields, which are oscillating at right angles to each other. The energy of an electromagnetic wave propagates at a direction at right angles to the oscillations in both the electric and magnetic fields.\n[12] As per the medium, the waves can be differentiated as mechanical and electromagnetic waves. Electromagnetic waves are waves that have no medium to travel whereas mechanical waves need a medium for its transmission. Electromagnetic waves travel in a vacuum whereas mechanical waves do not. The mechanical waves need a medium like water, air, or anything for it to travel. The ripples made in a pool of water after a stone is thrown in the middle are an example of mechanical waves. Examples of electromagnetic waves include light and radio signals.\n[13] Sound can travel through air, water, or solids, but it can't travel through a vacuum. It needs the medium to help it travel. Other examples include water waves, seismic waves, and waves traveling through a spring. Electromagnetic waves are waves that can travel through a vacuum (empty space). They don't need a medium or matter. They travel through electrical and magnetic fields that are generated by charged particles. Examples of electromagnetic waves include light, microwaves, radio waves, and X-rays.\n[14] How fast do radio waves travel? Radio waves travel at a velocity that is equal to the speed of light traveling in a vacuum, which is 186,282 miles per second. Top speed is only possible in empty space; passing through transparent liquids and solids like crystals cause waves to bend, which slows down their speed. Full Answer >.\n[15] Although turning on a radio produces sound, radio waves themselves cannot be heard and have nothing to do with sound waves. While sound waves are a vibration of the air, radio waves are electromagnetic and a part of the light spectrum. Radio waves travel at a speed of 186,282 miles (299,727 kilometers) per second\u2014the speed of light.\n[16] Some examples of electromagnetic waves are Radio, Gamma, X \u2026 -rays, Infra-red, and Microwaves Electromagnetic waves are able to travel through a medium of liquids, solids, and geaseous states, or through space where there is no material at all, called vacuum. 23 people found this useful.\n[17] Why does it take so long for the radio waves to travel through space?

The reason that it takes so long for radio messages to travel in space is that space is mind-bogglingly big. The distances to be traveled are so great that even light or radio waves take a while getting there.\n[18] The weak absorption of radio waves by the medium through which it passes is what enables radar sets to detect objects at relatively long ranges\u2014ranges at which other electromagnetic wavelengths, such as visible light, infrared light, and ultraviolet light, are too strongly attenuated.\n[19] Radio waves are electromagnetic waves and travel at the speed of light which is 186, 280 miles per second (983,558,400 feet per second). The voltage in a radio wave alternates back and forth between plus and minus many times per second and we call this the frequency of the radio wave in cycles per second.\n[20] Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic (EM) radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light . They have have frequencies from 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz, and corresponding wavelengths from 1 millimeter to 100 kilometers.

Digital radio has better-quality reception as it uses digital signals and so does not have problems of noise and interference.\n[3] But by definition radio waves are not sound waves. Radio waves can travel in a vacuum, but sound waves need a physical medium. To explain \u2026 the apparent contradiction, the sound wave is converted to an electrical signal version that is then used to modulate the radio signal. 3 people found this useful. Asif Shaik.\n[4] It's simple. Radio waves travel unbelievably fast\u2014at the speed of light (300,000 km or 186,000 miles per second). Analog radio. Ocean waves carry energy by making the water move up and down. In much the same way, radio waves carry energy as an invisible, up-and-down movement of electricity and magnetism.\n[5] Radio wave, wave from the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum at lower frequencies than microwaves. The wavelengths of radio waves range from thousands of metres to 30 cm. These correspond to frequencies as low as 3 Hz and as high as 1 gigahertz (10 9 Hz). Radio-wave communications signals travel through the air in a straight line, reflect off of clouds or layers of the ionosphere, or are relayed by satellites in space. They are used in standard broadcast radio and television, shortwave radio, navigation and air-traffic control, cellular telephony, and even remote-controlled toys.\n[6] Actually, radio waves travel very quickly through space.

In each case, there would be no wave without it.

Electromagnetic (EM) waves (example light waves, radio waves, x-rays etc) can travel through vacuum; they do not require any medium (matter) to travel through and their travel is reduced, to some extent, by the presence of any medium. The common examples of medium are glass, water, air etc.\n[4] (This includes visible light, radio waves, gamma rays, x-rays, ultraviolet rays, infra-red waves, and microwaves.) They both are able to travel through a medium of gas, liquid, or solid. Also, electromagnetic waves have the weird quantum property of sometimes acting like waves, and sometimes acting like particles.\n[5] S, India. Unlike sound waves or ocean waves, radios waves do not travel in a material. Radio waves are a class of electromagnetic waves and consist of nothing more than electric and magnetic fields.

Also, gamma rays are short and therefore very high energy which is another way to pass though materials. Interestingly, very long radio waves drag in the earth and water, slowing down and will hug the Earth...\n[8] Since the actual oscillations take place at right angles to the direction of wave propagation, radio waves are transverse waves. Since radio waves are not mechanical, they do not need a medium to travel in; they can travel even in a vacuum. Like all types of electromagnetic waves, radio waves travel at a speed of about 300 000 km per second in a vacuum. When radio waves enter into other material, they slow down a little. When you tune a radio to listen to a particular frequency, the radio takes in the signals at that frequency.\n[9] Best Answer: How, five circular answers so far (radio waves don't need a medium because electromagnetic waves don't need a medium). There actually is a medium, of sorts. It's called the vacuum.

The main difference between radio waves and sound waves is that radio waves are a type of electromagnetic wave that can travel when there is no medium, whereas sound waves are a type of mechanical wave that cannot travel if there is no medium. What are Radio Waves. Radio waves are electromagnetic waves. These are waves composed of electric and magnetic fields, which are oscillating at right angles to each other. The energy of an electromagnetic wave propagates at a direction at right angles to the oscillations in both the electric and magnetic fields.\n[16] No, a radio wave is not a mechanical wave. A radio wave is a form of electromagnetic (EM) energy, and it does not require a medium through which to travel like a mechanical wa \u2026 ve does. Radio waves can travel through the vacuum of space. Let's contrast that with a mechanical wave.\n[17] How fast do radio waves travel? Radio waves travel at a velocity that is equal to the speed of light traveling in a vacuum, which is 186,282 miles per second. Top speed is only possible in empty space; passing through transparent liquids and solids like crystals cause waves to bend, which slows down their speed. Full Answer >.\n[18] Why does it take so long for the radio waves to travel through space? Actually, radio waves travel very quickly through space. Radio waves are a kind of electromagnetic radiation, and thus they move at the speed of light. The speed of light is a little less than 300,000 km per second. At that speed, a beam of light could go around the Earth at the equator more then 7 times in a second. The reason that it takes so long for radio messages to travel in space is that space is mind-bogglingly big. The distances to be traveled are so great that even light or radio waves take a while getting there.\n[19] Actually, radio waves travel very quickly through space.

It takes around eight minutes for radio waves to travel from the Earth to the Sun, and four years to get from here to the nearest star.\n[20] Although turning on a radio produces sound, radio waves themselves cannot be heard and have nothing to do with sound waves. While sound waves are a vibration of the air, radio waves are electromagnetic and a part of the light spectrum. Radio waves travel at a speed of 186,282 miles (299,727 kilometers) per second\u2014the speed of light.\nSearch Query: what medium do radio waves travel through.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.
