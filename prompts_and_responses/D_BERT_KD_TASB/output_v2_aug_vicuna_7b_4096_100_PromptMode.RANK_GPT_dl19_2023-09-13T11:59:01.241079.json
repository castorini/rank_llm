The female flea consumes 15 times her own body weight in blood daily.\n[2] The Pet Shed Petcyclopedia explains that a flea can live for a little over 130 days when it has access to a host. When a flea loses its host, it must find a new one as quickly as possible. According to 1-800-PetMeds, a little over half of newborn fleas may be able to survive for two months without a host if their environment is humid enough. On the other hand, newly hatched fleas in a dry and cold environment usually survive a few days at the most without feeding.\n[3] Cat fleas can survive solely on a diet of human blood. They're capable of living for 139 to 185 days if fed on human arms for 15 minutes each day. 10 minute feeding intervals can keep females alive for up to 30 days, and males for 17 days. In a recent study, fleas had continuous access to human blood for 12 days in an artificial setting. A significant number of fleas survived, especially when dog hair was added to their cages.\n[4] Before becoming adult fleas, the larvae transform into pupae within a silk-like cocoon. Pupae remain inside the cocoon for 2 to 4 weeks, sometimes longer. The cocoon is resistant to insecticides and this is why some adult fleas are seen for an extended period, even after the home and pet are treated.\n[5] The pupae stage of the flea life cycle accounts for about 10 percent of the flea population in a home. This cocoon stage is the last developmental stage before the adult flea emerges. The cocoon protects the pupae for several days or weeks before the adult flea emerges.\n[6] The flea population is typically. made up of 50% eggs, 30% larvae, 15% pupae and only 5% biting adults. Completion of the life cycle from egg to adult varies from two weeks to eight months. Normally the female flea lays about 15 to 20 eggs per day up to 600 in a lifetime. Usual hosts for fleas are dogs, cats, rats, rabbits, mice, squirrels, chipmunks, raccoons, opossums, foxes, chickens, and humans.\n[7] Lifespan/Longevity. Lifespan of these water fleas depends heavily on environmental conditions such as oxygen levels, food availability, and temperature. In general, as temperature decreases, lifespan increases, with averages of 40 days at 25\u00b0C and 56 days at 20\u00b0C. Unstable environmental conditions tend to lead to shorter lifespans.\n[8] The Pet Shed Petcyclopedia explains that a flea can live for a little over 130 days when it has access to a host.

According to 1-800-PetMeds, a little over half of newborn fleas may be able to survive for two months without a host if their environment is humid enough.\n[9] 6 weeks. In 3 weeks, one flea can pass through its entire life cycle and can lay 1000 eggs. In another 3 weeks, those eggs can hatch and lay 1,000 eggs each, so within 6 weeks, it is possible to have a million new fleas.f the temperature is 95\u00b0F and there is 70% humidity, half of all flea eggs hatch within 36 hours. If it is only 55\u00b0F, half of all flea eggs will hatch within 6 days.\n[10] 1 One flea broke a record with a four-foot vertical jump. 2 Undisturbed and without a blood meal, a flea can live more than 100 days. On average, they live two to three months. Female fleas cannot lay eggs until after their first blood meal and begin to lay eggs within 36-48 hours after that meal.\n[11] Best Answer: maybe 18 months ... They can live for up to 2 years and that is not counting the baby fleas that hatch in the mean time. Those little f*er's a pain to ...\n[12] The flea life cycle has four stages: 1 Egg: An adult female flea can lay up to 40 eggs a day. 2 Larva: When the eggs hats, larvae emerge. 3 Pupa: Once in the cocoon, the larva begins its transformation into the adult flea. Adult flea: A fully-developed flea only emerges from its cocoon when a host is available.\n[13] They eat the feces of adult fleas (which is mostly dried blood) and other organic debris found in the carpet, bedding, and soil. Depending on the amount of food present and the environmental conditions, the larval stage lasts about 5 to 18 days (longer in some cases) then the larva spins a silken cocoon and pupates.\n[14] The flea population is typically. made up of 50% eggs, 1 Completion of the life cycle from egg to adult varies from two weeks to eight months. Normally the female flea lays about 15 to 20 eggs per day up to 600 in a lifetime.\n[15] Fleas can lay 20 to 40 eggs per day, and 10 female fleas can create almost a quarter of a million different life stages in a month. Newly emerged flea larvae can survive two weeks without a blood meal, and pre-emerged fleas (pupae/cocoon stage) can survive six months without feeding.\n[16] A female flea will begin laying eggs about 24 hours after enjoying her first blood meal. Fleas pass their time on their host eating, breeding and laying eggs. Usually, an adult flea will live for two or three months. Fleas are more than irritating; they can cause tapeworm as well as flea allergies in pets.\n[17] 1 Undisturbed and without a blood meal, a flea can live more than 100 days. 2 On average, they live two to three months. 3 Female fleas cannot lay eggs until after their first blood meal and begin to lay eggs within 36-48 hours after that meal.

The other fleas are scattered about as eggs, larvae or pupae. Adult fleas generally live two to four weeks, although in a hospitable environment they may live up to four months.\n[19] 6 weeks. In 3 weeks, one flea can pass through its entire life cycle and can lay 1000 eggs. In another 3 weeks, those eggs can hatch and lay 1,000 eggs each, so within 6 weeks, it is possible to have a million new fleas.he female lays eggs 24-36 hours after her first blood meal. Fleas lay up to 50 eggs a day, which is equal to their body weight. They can lay this many eggs because they suck up 15 times their body weight in blood daily. This blood lust can continue for 3 months.\n[20] Quick Answer. The amount of time fleas can survive without feeding varies from several days to two months depending on the humidity of the environment.

When the feeding time was restricted to 12 hours, the fleas didn't reach the point of dependency, and some lived as long as 14 days after being removed from the host.\n[5] 1 Completion of the life cycle from egg to adult varies from two weeks to eight months. 2 Normally the female flea lays about 15 to 20 eggs per day up to 600 in a lifetime. Usual hosts for fleas are dogs, cats, rats, rabbits, mice, squirrels, chipmunks, raccoons, opossums, foxes, chickens, and humans.\n[6] How Long Do Fleas Live? Fleas can live as an adult for more than a year, and they can lay eggs within 30 days, as well. Find out how fleas can survive through the winter in pupae cases with help from a pest control operator in this free video on flea control and extermination. Part of the Video Series: Flea Control.\n[7] Fleas can live up to 2 weeks without a food supply, however flea larvae can stay in their cocoon for up to a year or until they sense food outside the cocoon.

Fleas transport themselves on rodents and other mammals, and usually remain on their hosts at all times. These pests use their powerful legs to jump as high as 8 vertically, which is 150 times their own height. If humans could do this, we would be able to leap over skyscrapers.\n[9] After about 2 days (range 2-21 days), depending on environmental conditions, the flea egg hatches torelease a first stage flea larva. This flea larva lives in the host's environment(it is part of the environmental stage of the fleas life cycle), where it feeds on fleadroppings (flea dirt) and dander.fter about 2 days (range 2-21 days), depending on environmental conditions, the flea egg hatches torelease a first stage flea larva. This flea larva lives in the host's environment(it is part of the environmental stage of the fleas life cycle), where it feeds on fleadroppings (flea dirt) and dander.\n[10] The life cycle depends on the humidity and temperature of your house: The eggs hatch in 1-6 days. They will be in the carpet, the furniture and are in highest numbers where she spends most of her time. The eggs hatch to become larvae. They molt and have 3 stages. The total time for this stage is 6-36 days. The pupae is a cocoon that the larvae goes into. The cocoon takes about 7-10 days to develop but then can be dormant for a long time until a host enters the situation (such as a cat). The adult flea is really only on the pet for about 2 weeks. The rest of the time is spent off the pet.\n[11] The flea life cycle has four stages: 1 Egg: An adult female flea can lay up to 40 eggs a day. 2 Larva: When the eggs hats, larvae emerge. 3 Pupa: Once in the cocoon, the larva begins its transformation into the adult flea.

Usual hosts for fleas are dogs, cats, rats, rabbits, mice, squirrels, chipmunks, raccoons, opossums, foxes, chickens, and humans.\n[4] Female fleas need to keep feeding on blood to ensure their metabolism stays in balance while they are laying eggs. Adults on a host animal can live for 133 days, but if they become dislodged they need to rapidly find a new host, or quickly hop back onto the original host. They die within four days of losing their host.\n[5] However, completely developed adult fleas can live for several months without eating, so long as they do not emerge from their puparia.

These larva can live in bedding, carpet, furniture, any place that the host has been. Get this, they live as larva for up to 200 days before they turn into pupae. Pupae can wait dormant for over a year if conditions aren't yet right to become adults. When conditions are right, many generations of fleas can transform into adults leading to a flea infestation. Fleas are bad news.\n[7] 1 Undisturbed and without a blood meal, a flea can live more than 100 days. On average, they live two to three months. Female fleas cannot lay eggs until after their first blood meal and begin to lay eggs within 36-48 hours after that meal.\n[8] Mathematically, this means that the average flea lifespan is five times longer (if a flea has to touch diatomaceous earth 5 times to die, then that would be 5 hops with full coverage and 25 hops on average with 20% coverage).\n[9] Without a host for food a flea's life might be as short as a few days.

Fleas generally don't survive past 100 days, even if they live on a host (the animal on which they feed). However, without a host, they have no food source, and may die between 2 and 14 days. The same can't be said for flea eggs and larvae, which do not require a host and can reach high populations. Adult Flea 1. Once an adult flea is deprived of its host, it will basically starve to death. It will generally die between 2 and 14 days.\n[3] Under ideal conditions, the cat flea life cycle takes just 18 days, from egg to adult. Adult fleas (both male and female) require a blood meal prior to mating. They prefer blood from your pet, but in the absence of a canine or feline host, fleas will bite people.\n[4] Flea Pupa. The flea larvae spin cocoons around themselves in which they move to the last phase of the flea life cycle and become adult fleas. The larvae can remain in the cocoon anywhere from one week to one year. Temperature is one factor that determines how long it will take for the adult flea to emerge from the cocoon.\n[5] In appearance, flea larvae can be up to \u00bc-inch long and are white (almost see-through) and legless. Larvae make up about 35 percent of the flea population in the average household. If conditions are favorable, the larvae will spin cocoons in about 5-20 days of hatching from their eggs.This leads to the next life stage, called the cocoon or pupae stage.The pupae stage of the flea life cycle accounts for about 10 percent of the flea population in a home.f conditions are favorable, the larvae will spin cocoons in about 5-20 days of hatching from their eggs.

In just 30 days, ten female fleas under ideal conditions can multiply to more than a quarter of a million new fleas in different life stages. Eggs are loosely laid in the hair coat of your pet. They are wet and sticky when first produced but dry out and usually drop from an animal within a few hours.\n[7] The entire cycle can last as short as a few weeks or as long as months, depending on the environmental conditions. PetMD states the ideal conditions for flea propagation are temperatures ranging between 70 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit and 70 percent humidity. An adult flea can live up to two weeks without a host. credit: Dixi_/iStock/Getty Images.\n[8] The so-called \"sand-flea\" is nothing more than a common flea that is breeding outdoors in the soil. Contrary to belief, fleas cannot go through several generations without having a blood meal. The entire life cycle (Figure 5) of a flea can require two weeks to two years. Hot, wet, summer months favor egg laying.\n[9] Types of Fleas. There are thousands of types of fleas, but the most common seen in the United States is the cat flea. It has a lifespan between 30 and 75 days and four different developmental stages. Fleas feed on the blood of the host cat.\n[10] It can take as little as a couple days or as long as a couple weeks for flea eggs to hatch. Upon reaching adulthood, fleas may live a few more weeks, or up to a year or longer \u2026 depending on numerous external factors.\n[11] The flea life cycle has four stages: 1 Egg: An adult female flea can lay up to 40 eggs a day. 2 Larva: When the eggs hats, larvae emerge. 3 Pupa: Once in the cocoon, the larva begins its transformation into the adult flea.

Flea larvae are approximately 3 to 5.2 mm long and are semitransparent white in color. The larval stage lasts from four to 18 days, after which larvae spin silken cocoons and enter the pupal stage. The pupal stage may be complete within three days, or it can last as long as one year.\n[2] The flea life cycle. Adult fleas spend most of their time on your dog or cat. They can live up to two years and a female will start laying eggs within two days of finding a host. The eggs that are laid by females fall off the cat or dog into the environment along with 'flea dirts' (flea excrement).\n[3] The entire cycle can last as short as a few weeks or as long as months, depending on the environmental conditions. PetMD states the ideal conditions for flea propagation are temperatures ranging between 70 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit and 70 percent humidity. An adult flea can live up to two weeks without a host.\n[4] The lifecycle of a flea. 5% of fleas live in the environment as an adult, 95 % of fleas live as eggs, larvae or pupae. For effective flea control it is essential to break the lifecycle in the environment. 1 Adult Fleas-jump onto your dog or cat, feed on its blood and then start laying eggs. One flea broke a record with a four-foot vertical jump. 2 Undisturbed and without a blood meal, a flea can live more than 100 days. 3 On average, they live two to three months. 4 Female fleas cannot lay eggs until after their first blood meal and begin to lay eggs within 36-48 hours after that meal.\n[5] The pupal stage (cocoon) - The cocoon is the crux of flea infestation persistence in the house-hold. It generally hatches in 1-2 weeks, but can last up to a year. The adult flea - Adult fleas can live for some weeks (maximum of about 2 months if no host is present) in ideal, cool, moist conditions.\n[6] Fleas prefer a warm, humid environment, with temperatures ranging between 70\u00b0 and 90\u00b0 Fahrenheit and a relative humidity of 75% or more. Under ideal conditions, the cat flea life cycle takes just 18 days, from egg to adult.

On average, they live two to three months. 2 Female fleas cannot lay eggs until after their first blood meal and begin to lay eggs within 36-48 hours after that meal. The female flea can lay 2,000 eggs in her lifetime.\n[8] Fleas removed from their host will die of starvation within four days. Young fleas that haven't fed can live slightly longer without a blood meal, around one week. Pre-emerged adults, remaining inside their cocoons, can enter into a dormant-like state. They can survive for up to 155 days without feeding.\n[9] In 3 weeks, one flea can pass through its entire life cycle and can lay 1000 eggs. In another 3 weeks, those eggs can hatch and lay 1,000 eggs each, so within 6 weeks, it is possible to have a million new fleas.\n[10] Fleas are holometabolous insects, going through the four lifecycle stages of egg, larva, pupa, and imago (adult). Adult fleas must feed on blood before they can become capable of reproduction. Flea populations are distributed with about 50% eggs, 35% larvae, 10% pupae, and 5% adults.enerally speaking, an adult flea only lives for 2 or 3 months.

One of the most important things is life cycle of the flea, which depending on the environmental temperature and humidity levels can take between a couple of week to many months. There are four stages in the life cycle of a flea: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Here we will discuss all four\u2026.\n[4] The cat flea's life cycle is one of complete metamorphosis: an egg stage, larval (grub) stage, pupal (cocoon) stage and adult stage. The cat flea's life cycle usually lasts from about 1 to 2 \u00bd months and depends on the temperature and humidity of their habitat. Adults are the only stage that lives on the host, and the female adult cat flea must have a fresh blood meal in order to produce a new batch of eggs.\n[5] Completely developed adult fleas can live for several months without eating, as long as they do not emerge from their cacoons. Newly emerged adult fleas live only about one week if a blood meal is not obtained. Optimum temperatures for the flea's life cycle are 70\u00b0F to 85\u00b0F and optimum humidity is 70 percent.\n[6] The whole cycle can be as quick as 20 days or can last up to one full year; this is because the flea may be in a dormant stage for a long time. The cycle can be interrupted at any stage, but some flea control methods are more effective than others depending upon the stage the flea is in.\n[7] In homes, flea larvae live for 7-11 days before pupating. In ideal environments, they can fully develop in 4-7 days. In poor conditions, it may take 28-45 days for flea larvae to mature. How quickly they develop depends upon ambient temperature, relative humidity, and food availability.\n[8] When it comes to eliminating fleas from your pet and from your home, there are some key things to consider.

The cat flea life cycle is one of complete metamorphosis, involving the stages of an egg, larva, pupa, and adult. This cycle usually lasts 30 to 75 days, yet may vary due to external factors, such as temperature and humidity.\n[2] There are four stages in a flea's life: egg, larva (maggoty-like-thing), pupa (in a cocoon) and adult. Egg-to-egg life cycle is usually two to four weeks. Under the right conditions this can be a little shorter (12 days), or much longer (8 months).\n[3] The life cycle of a flea can last anywhere from 20 days to an entire year. It depends on how long the flea remains in the dormant stage (eggs, larvae, pupa). Outside influences, such as weather, affect the flea cycle. A female flea can lay around 20 to 25 eggs in one day. The flea egg stage is the beginning of the flea cycle. This part of the flea cycle represents a little more than one third of the flea population at any given time. Depending on the temperature and humidity of the environment the egg can take from two to six days to hatch.\n[4] Fleas have four life stages, lasting weeks or months, depending on the environment. An adult flea can live up to two weeks without a host. Fleas have four life stages, lasting weeks or months, depending on the environment.\n[5] The time it takes to complete the life cycle from egg to adult varies from two weeks to eight months, depending on the temperature, humidity and the amount of food available. A typical flea population consists of 50 per cent eggs, 35 per cent larvae, ten per cent pupae and only five per cent adults.\n[6] How Long Do Fleas Live. Flea Life Span. Fleas can live up to a year and a half when they have a food supply, the optimum temperature (70F to 85F), and ideal humidity (70%). In reality though, most live for an average of 2-3 months. Even if you remove the pets from your house for a time, the fleas can still survive for several months without feeding.\n[7] 30-90 Days (Average). A flea might live a year and a half under ideal conditions. These include the right temperature, food supply, and humidity. Generally speaking, though, an adult flea only lives for 2 or 3 months. Without a host for food, a flea's life might be as short as a few days.\n[8] 1 Fleas pass through a complete life cycle of four stages. made up of 50% eggs, 30% larvae, 15% pupae and only 5% biting adults. 1 Completion of the life cycle from egg to adult varies from two weeks to eight months. Normally the female flea lays about 15 to 20 eggs per day up to 600 in a lifetime.\n[9] Once the flea reaches adulthood, its primary goal is to find blood and then to reproduce. Its total life span can be as long one and one-half years in ideal conditions. Female fleas can lay 5000 or more eggs over their life, allowing for phenomenal growth rates. Average 30\u201390 days.\n[10] Completely developed adult fleas can live for several months without eating, as long as they do not emerge from their cacoons. Newly emerged adult fleas live only about one week if a blood meal is not obtained. Optimum temperatures for the flea's life cycle are 70\u00b0F to 85\u00b0F and optimum humidity is 70 percent. Breaking the cycle with an Insect Growth Regulator , not just killing the few adults is the secret to flea control.\n[11] Flea Pupa. The flea larvae spin cocoons around themselves in which they move to the last phase of the flea life cycle and become adult fleas. The larvae can remain in the cocoon anywhere from one week to one year. Temperature is one factor that determines how long it will take for the adult flea to emerge from the cocoon.\n[12] In appearance, flea larvae can be up to \u00bc-inch long and are white (almost see-through) and legless. Larvae make up about 35 percent of the flea population in the average household. If conditions are favorable, the larvae will spin cocoons in about 5-20 days of hatching from their eggs.This leads to the next life stage, called the cocoon or pupae stage.The pupae stage of the flea life cycle accounts for about 10 percent of the flea population in a home.f conditions are favorable, the larvae will spin cocoons in about 5-20 days of hatching from their eggs.

The pupae stage of the flea life cycle accounts for about 10 percent of the flea population in a home.\n[13] When it comes to eliminating fleas from your pet and from your home, there are some key things to consider. First, it is very important to be familiar with and understand the life cycle of the flea when you are trying to eradicate their presence completely. There are four stages in the life cycle of a flea: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Depending on the environmental temperature and humidity levels, the total life cycle will take anywhere from a couple weeks to many months. Optimal conditions for fleas are between 70-85\u00b0F and 70 percent humidity.\n[14] When it comes to eliminating fleas from your pet and from your home, there are some key things to consider.

The complete life cycle of the flea takes about four weeks, varying according to the temperature. The female fleas lay at night while attached to the bird, and the very small eggs fall to the ground. In about four days, small wormlike larvae emerge from the eggs. The larvae feed on organic material, mainly the dried blood excreted by the adult fleas, and shelter in the surface dust and litter on the soil.\n[16] The cat flea's life cycle is one of complete metamorphosis: an egg stage, larval (grub) stage, pupal (cocoon) stage and adult stage. The cat flea's life cycle usually lasts from about 1 to 2 \u00bd months and depends on the temperature and humidity of their habitat. Adults are the only stage that lives on the host, and the female adult cat flea must have a fresh blood meal in order to produce a new batch of eggs.\n[17] The adult cat flea can survive on the host and maintain some reproduction for 2-4 weeks under most natural conditions, but if not killed prematurely an adult flea may live as long as 4 months.

Adult flea: A fully-developed flea only emerges from its cocoon when a host is available.\n[20] The flea life cycle. Adult fleas spend most of their time on your dog or cat. They can live up to two years and a female will start laying eggs within two days of finding a host. The eggs that are laid by females fall off the cat or dog into the environment along with 'flea dirts' (flea excrement).\nSearch Query: how long is life cycle of flea.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

A declaratory judgment may only be granted in justiciable controversies\u2014that is, in actual, rather than hypothetical, controversies that fall within a court's jurisdiction.\n[6] The Declaratory Act was a gesture of British Parliament reasserting its authority to pass taxes and laws on the colonies, even though they lacked any representation.\n[7] A party against whom a claim, counterclaim, or cross claim is asserted or a declaratory judgment is sought may move with or without supporting affidavits for a summary judgment in such party's favor as to all or any part thereof. (c) Motion and Proceedings.\n[8] The Declaratory Act was a proclamation that strengthened the lawmaking authority of the parliament over the American colonies. This was created to clarify the rules and po \u2026 licies in the relationship of Britain and America.\n[9] The Declaratory Act was a measure issued by British Parliament asserting its authority to make laws binding the colonists \"in all cases whatsoever\" including the right to tax.he Declaratory Act was a reaction of British Parliament to the failure of the Stamp Act as they did not want to give up on the principle of imperial taxation asserting its legal right to tax colonies.\n[10] One factor which supports the dismissal of a declaratory judgment action is the conduct of the insurer in filing such a declaratory judgment action to pre-empt the insured from having a choice of forum in a first party claim.\n[11] Rule 57. These rules govern the procedure for obtaining a declaratory judgment under 28 U.S.C. \u00a72201. Rules 38 and 39 govern a demand for a jury trial. The existence of another adequate remedy does not preclude a declaratory judgment that is otherwise appropriate. The court may order a speedy hearing of a declaratory-judgment action.\n[12] The same court observed that even if the basic requirements for A Declaratory Judgment Action are met, it is still within the discretion of the district court to decline a Declaratory Judgment Action..

A party seeking declaratory relief under the statute must present an \"actual controversy\" in order to satisfy the \"case or controversy\" requirement of Article III. The Declaratory Judgment Act was not intended as a device for rendering mere advisory opinions. The case must involve a controversy that is substantial and concrete, must touch the legal relations of parties with adverse interests, and must be subject to specific relief through a decree of conclusive character.\n[15] Pursuant to G.L. 1956 \u00a7 9-30-1, Rhode Island's enactment of the Uniform Declaratory.

The main purpose of this kind of remedy is to determine an individual's rights in a particular situation.\n[17] Declaratory Act 1719. An Act for the better securing the dependency of the Kingdom of Ireland on the Crown of Great Britain (6. Geo. I, c. 5) was a 1719 Act passed by the Parliament of Great Britain which declared that it had the right to pass laws for the Kingdom of Ireland, and that the British House of Lords had appellate jurisdiction for Irish court cases.\n[18] DECLARATORY ACT, 1766. DECLARATORY ACT, 1766. The first defining fact of the Declaratory Act of 1766 was that it followed hard on the heels of Parliament's repeal of the detested Stamp Act of 1765, England's first major retreat in the face of colonial American resistance.he Declaratory Act, in mid-March, affirmed England's right to bind the colonies \u2026 in all cases, whether it be the right to tax, enforcement of all parliamentary laws, or crown prerogatives over its colonies in general; all were subject always to British sovereignty.\n[19] In other words, the Declaratory Act of 1766 asserted that Parliament had the absolute power to make laws and changes to the colonial government, in all cases whatsoever, even though the colonists were not represented in the Parliament.his Declaratory Act was copied almost word for word from the Irish Declaratory Act, an Act which had placed Ireland in a position of bondage to the crown, implying that the same fate would come to The Thirteen Colonies.\n[20] [adapted]. A drawing of the House of Commons of the British parliament, c.1765. There was nothing drastic or immediately threatening about the Declaratory Act, passed by the British parliament immediately after the Stamp Act was repealed in 1766.he Declaratory Act was viewed by some in the colonies, quite justifiably, as a face-saving measure. Many considered it a statement of political sovereignty, issued to ease the embarrassment of the Stamp Act repeal. Others thought the Declaratory Act a more sinister development.\nSearch Query: definition declaratory judgment.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

A ruling of a court in a civil case which declares the rights, duties, or obligations of each party in a dispute, but does not necessarily award any damages or other relief.\n[2] A declaratory judgment is one which simply declares the rights of the parties, or expresser, the opinion of the court on a. question of law, without ordering anything to be done.\n[3] Declaratory judgments are judgment of a court in a civil case that declares the rights, duties, or obligations of each party in a dispute. However, a declaratory judgment does not order any action or result in any award of damages to any party to the case.\n[4] A declaratory judgment, sometimes called declaratory relief, is conclusive and legally binding as to the present and future rights of the parties involved. The parties involved in a declaratory judgment may not later seek another court resolution of the same legal issue unless they appeal the judgment.\n[5] A declaratory judgment, also called a declaration, is the legal determination of a court that resolves legal uncertainty for the litigants.\n[6] The declaratory judgment is generally considered a statutory remedy and not an equitable remedy in the United States, and is thus not subject to equitable requirements, though there are analogies that can be found in the remedies granted by courts of equity.\n[7] A ruling by a court (or, less commonly, a regulator) that resolves a dispute but does not order an action. That is, a declaratory judgment states a fact. For example, a declaratory judgment may state who owns a patent or a piece of property.\n[8] A declaratory judgment does not provide for any enforcement, however. In other words, it states the court's authoritative opinion regarding the exact nature of the legal matter without requiring the parties to do anything.\n[9] Nolo's Plain-English Law Dictionary. A court decision in a civil case that tells the parties what their rights and responsibilities are, without awarding damages or ordering them to do anything. Courts are usually reluctant to hear declaratory judgment cases, preferring to wait until there has been a measurable loss. But especially in cases involving important constitutional rights, courts will step in to clarify the legal landscape.\n[10] 9.3 Declaratory Judgment Act. The Declaratory Judgment Act offers a unique mechanism by which advocates may seek to remedy ongoing violations of statutory or constitutional provisions. The Act may authorize broad-based declaratory and injunctive relief without resort to class action procedures.\n[11] The unique feature of the Declaratory Judgment Act is its authorization to \"declare\" the rights and legal relations of the parties to the controversy; such declarations have the force and effect of a final judgment.\n[12] An insurance company, for example, might seek a declaratory judgment as to whether a policy applies to a certain person or event.

While HP's Photosmart printers don't include Bluetooth connectivity, many do have Wi-Fi. This provides a way for you to connect your printer to a wireless router so that multiple computers can access it.\n[4] Bluetooth is wireless communication standard which allows electronic devices to connect and interact with each other. It can be found in a number of gadgets, from smartphones, to loudspeakers, to laptops and more.\n[5] Best Answer: Radio.Bluetooth is a high-speed, low-power microwave wireless link technology, designed to connect phones, laptops, PDAs and other portable equipment together with little or no work by the user. Unlike infra-red, Bluetooth does not require line-of-sight positioning of connected units.\n[6] Bluetooth basically does the same thing a USB cable connection does, but it is a wireless connection to your printer, modem, and other peripherals. Bluetooth is a technology that allows voice and data connections between a wide range of mobile and stationary devices through short-range digital two-way radio. 1 Cellphone and PC manufacturers may enhance their Bluetooth product offerings with support for its low-energy wireless technology.\n[7] IEEE 802.11 working group standards like 802.11h and 802.11j are extensions or offshoots of Wi-Fi technology that each serve a very specific purpose. Bluetooth is an alternative wireless network technology that followed a different development path than the 802.11 family.\n[8] Bluetooth is a wireless service that allows voice and or data connectivity between 2 or more devices. It does not connect however between voice or data services of the phone; it is separate. In other words, no it will not use your data plan, unless you are streaming audio or data from an app like iheart radio, pandora, etc.\n[9] Bluetooth is a wireless technology that allows you to connect nearby devices, even if they aren't in direct line of sight. Most newer laptops come with Bluetooth hardware already installed, but the chances are lower if your computer is older, or if you're using a desktop.\n[10] Bluetooth is a wireless connectivity feature that has a short range and low power consumption. This makes it the perfect medium for sending information between devices in the same room. Using Bluetooth, you'll be able to connect to a wireless headset and entertainment devices like wireless speakers.\n[11] WiFi has a greater range than Bluetooth \u2013 perhaps as much as 120 feet indoors, but the actual range may be less. With some planning, WiFi can cover an entire house. One way to assure maximum coverage is to locate the WiFi router in the center of a house, or where its coverage is most useful.\n[12] Bluetooth vs. WiFi - Range: Maximum range for Bluetooth based wireless connections is 30m while for Wi-Fi, it can extend well upto 100m. In Wi-Fi, range depends on the version of Wi-Fi protocol applied and addition of antennas in the communication system while no such concerns of range or extra antenna are much known in Bluetooth. . Bluetooth vs. WiFi - Devices Connected: In Bluetooth, upto 7 devices can be connected to each other (piconet) while in Wi-Fi, the maximum connections depend on Wi-Fi router which can accommodate 1 to several communicating devices at a time.\n[13] Bluetooth 4.0 vs. Wi-Fi Direct: Speed. Wi-Fi Direct promises device-to-device transfer speeds of up to 250Mbps, while Bluetooth 4.0 promises speeds similar to Bluetooth 3.0 of up to 25Mbps. Both Bluetooth 4.0 and Wi-Fi Direct use the 802.11 networking standard to reach their maximum speeds.\n[14] Bluetooth 4.0 vs. Wi-Fi Direct: Speed Wi-Fi Direct promises device-to-device transfer speeds of up to 250Mbps, while Bluetooth 4.0 promises speeds similar to Bluetooth 3.0 of up to 25Mbps. Both Bluetooth 4.0 and Wi-Fi Direct use the 802.11 networking standard to reach their maximum speeds.\n[15] WiFi is a wireless networking technology that allows computers, some mobile phones, ipads, game consoles, and other devices to communicate over a wireless signal. The same way a radio can tune into a radio station signal over the airwaves, your device can pick up a signal that connects it to the internet, thru the air. As a matter of fact, a WiFi signal is a high-frequency radio signal.\n[16] The type of networks each standard creates is different as well. Bluetooth has no hub. Any two devices with Bluetooth adapters can connect to each other. A single Bluetooth-enabled device can connect to up to seven devices and each of those devices can connect to up to seven other devices. A Wi-Fi enabled network relies on a hub. All devices on a Wi-Fi network ultimately connect through a single wireless access point, also called a wireless router.\n[17] Also like WiFi, Bluetooth is \"fairly\" secure. Unlike WiFi, tethering via Bluetooth isn't all that common. Sure, people do it, but it's a little more involved to set up than WiFi, and a little more involved every time you want to use Bluetooth tethering. If power consumption is a concern, Bluetooth is probably the way to go, if you're willing to configure it.\n[18] What Is Bluetooth. Bluetooth 4.0, is a specific protocol for device to device communication using a radio frequency. Bluetooth is most commonly known as a protocol for hands off phone control. Yet, Bluetooth is used for a lot more than just phone control. Bluetooth devices include keyboards, mice, headphones, gaming controllers, remote controls, printers, and cameras are the most common computer devices using Bluetooth.\n[19] Understand how Bluetooth works. Bluetooth is a wireless technology that allows two different devices to connect. Every Bluetooth device has one or more profiles installed. These profiles determine what the device is capable of, such as Hands-Free (mobile headsets) or Human Interface Device (computer mouse).\n[20] Bluetooth is a short-range wireless technology you can use to connect devices together. For example, you can use Bluetooth to: Depending on the Bluetooth profiles included on the device, Bluetooth technology has the capability to wirelessly synchronize and transfer data among devices. The exact functionality provided by a Bluetooth enabled device depends on the Bluetooth profiles included.\nSearch Query: what is wifi vs bluetooth.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Source: Flickr/Dana Spiegel. Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are both methods that provide wireless communication, but the difference between the two mainly stems from what they are designed to do and how they are used. The main difference is that Bluetooth is primarily used to connect devices without using cables, while Wi-Fi provides high-speed access to the internet. Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard that is used to exchange data over short distances (less than 30 feet), usually between personal mobile devices.\n[2] Bluetooth and WiFi are different standards for wireless communication. Bluetooth technology is useful when transferring information between two or more devices that are near each other when speed is not an issue, such as telephones, printers, modems and headsets.\n[3] Bluetooth or Wi-Fi: what's the difference? Here's the biggest difference: With Bluetooth, you stream music from your phone to a speaker. A Wi-Fi speaker accesses music from the internet, or from a computer on your home network. You can control a Wi-Fi speaker with your smartphone. You just have to stay within range of your Wi-Fi router's signal.\n[4] Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are to some extent complementary in their applications and usage. Wi-Fi is usually access point-centered, with an asymmetrical client-server connection with all traffic routed through the access point, while Bluetooth is usually symmetrical, between two Bluetooth devices.\n[5] Stockbyte/Stockbyte/Getty Images. Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are both wireless networking technologies. They transmit information via radio signals broadcast through the air rather than over wires, allowing devices to communicate with each other and share information.\n[6] The choice of Bluetooth or WiFi is clear. Bluetooth is a universal standard and easy to use. But, its range is quite limited and sound quality is restricted. WiFi systems have a wider range and can offer excellent fidelity. But, different systems that use WiFi are incompatible, and setup may be difficult.\n[7] Bluetooth is an excellent method for tethering. Similar to Wifi, you can connect multiple devices to your smartphone wirelessly. Just like with WiFi, since no cable is required, power consumption is something to keep in mind.\n[8] Wi-Fi is used for creating wireless local area networks, linking devices within about 100 meters of a central wireless access point. Bluetooth has a much smaller range and is used to create personal area networks of devices that are within about 10 meters of each other.\n[9] Bluetooth and Wi-Fi (the brand name for products using IEEE 802.11 standards) have some similar applications: setting up networks, printing, or transferring files. Wi-Fi is intended as a replacement for high speed cabling for general local area network access in work areas.\n[10] Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard for exchanging data over short distances (using short-wavelength UHF radio waves in the ISM band from 2.4 to 2.485 GHz) from fixed and mobile devices, and building personal area networks (PANs).\n[11] Bluetooth vs. WiFi - Range: Maximum range for Bluetooth based wireless connections is 30m while for Wi-Fi, it can extend well upto 100m.

USER: I will provide you with 20 passages, each indicated by a numerical identifier []. Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: hydrogen is a liquid below what temperature.\n\n[1] Nascent Hydrogen. The hydrogen gas, which is just liberated as a result of a chemical is called nascent hydrogen or newly born hydrogen. It is obtained by passing dihydrogen gas at atmospheric pressure through an electric arc between two tungsten rods. The electric arc maintains a temperature around 4000 - 4500\u00b0C.\n[2] On the other hand, the molecules in liquid water are held together by relatively strong hydrogen bonds, and its enthalpy of vaporization, 40.65 kJ/mol, is more than five times the energy required to heat the same quantity of water from 0 \u00b0C to 100 \u00b0C (c p = 75.3 J K \u22121 mol \u22121).\n[3] Examples include butane, acetylene, methane and hydrogen. Flammable liquids are identified as liquids that have a flashpoint (minimum temperature needed for the liquid to produce a vapor with enough of a concentration to ignite) below 100 degrees Fahrenheit (F). There is an exception to this definition. If any of the components of the mixture have flashpoints of 100 deg. F or higher, then the material is classified as combustible rather than flammable. Another way to identify flammable liquids is by class. It is important to remember that with flammable liquids that it is the vapor coming off of the liquid that will ignite and burn, not necessarily the liquid itself.\n[4] Hydrogen cyanide (HCN), sometimes called prussic acid, is an organic compound with the chemical formula HCN. It is a colorless, extremely poisonous liquid that boils slightly above room temperature, at 25.6 \u00b0C (78.1 \u00b0F).ydrogen cyanide is a linear molecule, with a triple bond between carbon and nitrogen. A minor tautomer of HCN is HNC, hydrogen isocyanide. Hydrogen cyanide is weakly acidic with a pKa of 9.2. It partially ionizes in water solution to give the cyanide anion, CN \u2212 .\n[5] Hydrogen fluoride is a gas at room temperature. Its solution in water is known as hydrofluoric acid. Anhydrous hydrogen fluoride is the starting material for the production of most fluorine compounds.\n[6] Water (H 2O) is a polar inorganic compound that is at room temperature a tasteless and odorless liquid, nearly colorless with a hint of blue. This simplest hydrogen chalcogenide is by far the most studied chemical compound and is described as the universal solvent for its ability to dissolve many substances.\n[7] Hydrogen fluoride is a chemical compound with the chemical formula HF. This colorless gas or liquid is the principal industrial source of fluorine, often in the aqueous form as hydrofluoric acid, and thus is the precursor to many important compounds including pharmaceuticals and polymers (e.g. Teflon).F is widely used in the petrochemical industry and is a component of many superacids. Hydrogen fluoride boils near room temperature, while other hydrogen halides evaporate at much lower temperatures. Unlike other hydrogen halides, HF is lighter than air and diffuses relatively quickly through porous substances.\n[8] Liquid nitrogen is really amazing. It has a boiling point of -196 degrees Celsius (-321 degrees Fahrenheit), so it must be kept incredibly cold in order to exist as a liquid.\n[9] In fact, pure water only has a pH of 7 at a particular temperature - the temperature at which the Kw value is 1.00 x 10-14 mol2 dm-6. To find the pH you need first to find the hydrogen ion concentration (or hydroxonium ion concentration - it's the same thing). Then you convert it to pH.\n[10] The temperature of the first maximum of hydrogen consumption depends on the number K and shifts due to its increase from 800 \u00b1 5 K (laboratory E-2) to 850 \u00b1 30 K (laboratories CH-1, D-1, F-2, F-3 Set 2 and 3) and finally to 955 K (laboratory F-3 Set 1).\n[11] Oxygen has a boiling point of minus 297.31 degrees Fahrenheit or minus 182.95 degrees Celsius and a melting point of minus 361.82 degrees Fahrenheit or minus 218.79 degrees Celsius. Oxygen is a gas at room temperature and is classified as a non-metal.\n[12] For example water is a liquid for 100 degrees (Celsius). For most temperatures it is either a solid or a gas. At low pressures, the range of temperature for a liquid to exist is smaller. That is why water boils at less than 100OC at high altitudes.\n[13] Helium is a colorless, odorless, tasteless gas. It has a number of unusual properties. For example, it has the lowest boiling point of any element, -268.9\u00b0C (-452.0\u00b0F). The boiling point for a gas is the temperature at which the gas changes to a liquid. The freezing point of helium is -272.2\u00b0C (-458.0\u00b0F).\n[14] Hydrogen gas forms explosive mixtures with air if it is 4\u201374% concentrated and with chlorine if it is 5\u201395% concentrated. The mixtures may be ignited by spark, heat or sunlight. The hydrogen autoignition temperature, the temperature of spontaneous ignition in air, is 500 \u00b0C (932 \u00b0F).\n[15] Water (H. 2O) is a polar inorganic compound that is at room temperature a tasteless and odorless liquid, nearly colorless with a hint of blue. This simplest hydrogen chalcogenide is by far the most studied chemical compound and is described as the universal solvent for its ability to dissolve many substances.\n[16] Even though a hydrogen bond is only 5% as strong as a covalent bond, it's enough to stabilize water molecules. Hydrogen bonding causes water to remain liquid over a wide temperature range. Because it takes extra energy to break hydrogen bonds, water has an unusually high heat of vaporization. Water has a much higher boiling point than other hydrides. There are many important consequences of the effects of hydrogen bonding between water molecules: 1 Hydrogen bonding makes ice less dense than liquid water, so ice floats on water. 2 The effect of hydrogen bonding on heat of vaporization helps make perspiration an effective means of lowering temperature for animals.\n[17] However, the hydrogen bond strength in supercooled liquid water may be stronger than in ice (2020). The hydrogen bond strength is almost five times the average thermal collision fluctuation at 25 \u00b0C) to a neighboring oxygen atom of another water molecule and is far greater than any included van der Waals interaction.\n[18] This happens because the temperature at which oxygen changes from a gas to a liquid is about 13 degrees Celsius above that of nitrogen. The oxygen can be seen dripping from the can just as on a humid day you can see drops of water condense and drip from a can you take from the refrigerator.\n[19] Under normal atmospheric pressure, nitrogen can exist as a liquid between the temperatures of 63 K and 77.2 K. (-346\u00b0F and -320.44\u00b0F). Below 63 K, nitrogen freezes and becomes a solid. Above 77.2 K, nitrogen boils and becomes a gas. Since it is obtained from the atmosphere, liquid nitrogen is inexpensive and is rarely refrigerated. It is kept in insulated containers called Dewars and is allowed to boil away.\n[20] This is true for almost every compound known to man. At room temperature, ammonia, N \u2026 H3, is a gas. It becomes a liquid if cooled below -28 degrees F, and will freeze into a solid once below -108 degrees F. Household ammonia is liquid at room temperature; it is a solution of ammonia in water.\nSearch Query: hydrogen is a liquid below what temperature.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: hydrogen is a liquid below what temperature.\n\n[1] Properties: Common hydrogen has a molecular weight of 2,01594 g. As a gas it has a density of 0.071 g/l at 0\u00baC and 1 atm. Its relative density, compared with that of the air, is 0.0695. Hydrogen is the most flammable of all the known substances. Hydrogen is slightly more soluble in organic solvents than in water. Many metals absorb hydrogen.\n[2] even though mercury is a liquid at room temperature it is a metal so because of its metallic bonding its structure is more compact than water.ost metals are denser than water, and Mercury is a metal. where as the Water has bonding between the two hydrogen and one oxygen atom and so on clumping molecules with each other and hence forming weak bonds density reduces. water freezes at 32o Fahrenheit (F) and boils at 212o F, its the best solvent.\n[3] Hydrogen peroxide is the simplest form of peroxide, which is denoted as H2O2. It is a clear liquid with a boiling point of 150 oC. It is completely miscible with the water, however, can be completely separated by distillation because its boiling point is higher than that of water.\n[4] Hydrogen bonding contributes to many of the physical and chemical properties, such as the unusual but normally known freezing point of 273.15 K, and 373.15 K respectively. The critical temperature and pressure are 647.3 K and 220.5 bar (22050 kPa) and critical volume = 0.056 m3 kmol-1. Because of the many applications of water, some more details on the properties of water are desirable. Thus, keeping track of water properties is of national interest.\n[5] A clear, liquid compound of hydrogen and oxygen, H2O. Water covers about three-quarters of the Earth's surface and also occurs in solid form as ice and in gaseous form as vapor. It is an essential component of all organisms, and it is necessary for most biological processes. Water freezes at 32\u00b0F (0\u00b0C) and boils at 212\u00b0F (100\u00b0C).\n[6] Under normal atmospheric pressure, nitrogen can exist as a liquid between the temperatures of 63 K and 77.2 K. (-346\u00b0F and -320.44\u00b0F). Below 63 K, nitrogen freezes and becomes a solid. Above 77.2 K, nitrogen boils and becomes a gas. Since it is obtained from the atmosphere, liquid nitrogen is inexpensive and is rarely refrigerated. It is kept in insulated containers called Dewars and is allowed to boil away. Since it is boiling, most of the liquid nitrogen used in laboratories and in cryogenics shows is at a temperature of 77.2 K. Liquid nitrogen looks like boiling water. If you have never seen it, we have a picture of some posted on our site.\n[7] The boiling point of H 2O 2 has been extrapolated as being 150.2 \u00b0C, approximately 50 degrees higher than water; in practice hydrogen peroxide will undergo potentially explosive thermal decomposition if heated to this temperature. It may be safely distilled at lower temperatures under reduced pressure.\n[8] Why does water boil at a specific boiling temperature? It is the temperature at which enough heat energy has been put into the molecules, overpowering the hydrogen bonding between molecules. Water at the atmospheric pressure of se \u2026 a level boils at 100 degrees Celsius (or 212 degrees Fahrenheit or 373.15 degrees Kelvin).\n[9] The solubility of gases in water is usually thought to decrease with temperature, but this only occurs to a certain temperature, before increasing again. For nitrogen, this minimum is 74 \u00b0C and for oxygen it is 94 \u00b0C Gases are soluble in superheated water at elevated pressures.\n[10] Under normal atmospheric pressure, nitrogen can exist as a liquid between the temperatures of 63 K and 77.2 K.

Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: hydrogen is a liquid below what temperature.\n\n[1] When ignited, hydrogen gas combines with oxygen gas explosively in proportions ranging from 4.1 - 71.5% hydrogen - ignition temperature is ca. 580 \u00b0C. The gaseous reaction is. 2 H2(g) + O2(g) \u2192 2 H2O(g) This exothermic reaction yields 232 kJ/mol of water formed.\n[2] Give a reason for the fact that water, the hydride of oxygen, is a liquid at room temperature while the hydride of sulfur (the next member of Group 16) is a gas? (1.) Hydrogen fluoride is a liquid at room temperature and a weak acid but hydrogen chloride is a gas and a strong acid. Explain these facts. (2.) For similar reasons water and ammonia have unexpected properties.\n[3] The fact of Hydrogen's being a gas at standard temperature and pressure has nothing to do with whether it is a metal or not. Superheated iron vapor is still metallic as is mercury vapor and all other gaseous metals.\n[4] Hydrogen is the lightest of the elements with an atomic weight of 1.0. Liquid hydrogen has a density of 0.07 grams per cubic centimeter, whereas water has a density of 1.0 g/cc and gasoline about 0.75 g/cc. These facts give hydrogen both advantages and disadvantages.\n[5] Hydrogen is certainly not a colorful chemical element. But it has one surpassing feature. The hydrogen atom happens to be the smallest and lightest of all atomic elements. At temperatures above minus 423 degrees Fahrenheit, it boils and becomes the lightest of the gases.ydrogen is certainly not a colorful chemical element. But it has one surpassing feature. The hydrogen atom happens to be the smallest and lightest of all atomic elements. At temperatures above minus 423 degrees Fahrenheit, it boils and becomes the lightest of the gases.\n[6] Despite criticism and early technical failures, the taming of liquid hydrogen proved to be one of NASA's most significant technical accomplishments. . . . Hydrogen -- a light and extremely powerful rocket propellant -- has the lowest molecular weight of any known substance and burns with extreme intensity (5,500\u00b0F).\n[7] The temperature at which a liquid becomes a gas and a gas becomes a liquid. 100\u00b0C is the. boiling point of water at atmospheric pressure; 2750 \u00b0C is the boiling point of iron. Above these temperatures, the material is a gas, below, it is a liquid. Solid:\n[8] Hydrogen definition, a colorless, odorless, flammable gas that combines chemically with oxygen to form water: the lightest of the known elements. Symbol: H; atomic weight: 1.00797; atomic number: 1; density: 0.0899 g/l at 0\u00b0C and 760 mm pressure.\n[9] As it is a gas, Hydrogen is neither shiny or dull. It can be liquified at temperatures around 14 degK (about -435 degF) Gaseous Hydrogen will conduct electricity only when ionized, as such it is classed as an insulator. Astrobuf.\n[10] \u00b7 just now. Report Abuse. Hydrogen is a gas, so it's neither shiny or dull. Hydrogen is also very explosive, so it conducting electricity isn't a good idea! (So, no...) I'm guessing the 298K is 298 Kelvin, a temperature measure, but I have no idea what it's related to. Joe B. \u00b7 8 years ago. Thumbs up.\n[11] Helium is a colorless, odorless, tasteless gas. It has a number of unusual properties. For example, it has the lowest boiling point of any element, -268.9\u00b0C (-452.0\u00b0F). The boiling point for a gas is the temperature at which the gas changes to a liquid. The freezing point of helium is -272.2\u00b0C (-458.0\u00b0F).\n[12] Even though a hydrogen bond is only 5% as strong as a covalent bond, it's enough to stabilize water molecules. Hydrogen bonding causes water to remain liquid over a wide temperature range. Because it takes extra energy to break hydrogen bonds, water has an unusually high heat of vaporization. Water has a much higher boiling point than other hydrides. There are many important consequences of the effects of hydrogen bonding between water molecules: 1 Hydrogen bonding makes ice less dense than liquid water, so ice floats on water. 2 The effect of hydrogen bonding on heat of vaporization helps make perspiration an effective means of lowering temperature for animals.\n[13] Hydrogen gas forms explosive mixtures with air if it is 4\u201374% concentrated and with chlorine if it is 5\u201395% concentrated. The mixtures may be ignited by spark, heat or sunlight. The hydrogen autoignition temperature, the temperature of spontaneous ignition in air, is 500 \u00b0C (932 \u00b0F).\n[14] Properties: Common hydrogen has a molecular weight of 2,01594 g. As a gas it has a density of 0.071 g/l at 0\u00baC and 1 atm. Its relative density, compared with that of the air, is 0.0695. Hydrogen is the most flammable of all the known substances. Hydrogen is slightly more soluble in organic solvents than in water. Many metals absorb hydrogen.\n[15] Liquid nitrogen is really amazing. It has a boiling point of -196 degrees Celsius (-321 degrees Fahrenheit), so it must be kept incredibly cold in order to exist as a liquid.\n[16] Examples include butane, acetylene, methane and hydrogen. Flammable liquids are identified as liquids that have a flashpoint (minimum temperature needed for the liquid to produce a vapor with enough of a concentration to ignite) below 100 degrees Fahrenheit (F). There is an exception to this definition. If any of the components of the mixture have flashpoints of 100 deg. F or higher, then the material is classified as combustible rather than flammable. Another way to identify flammable liquids is by class. It is important to remember that with flammable liquids that it is the vapor coming off of the liquid that will ignite and burn, not necessarily the liquid itself.\n[17] This is true for almost every compound known to man. At room temperature, ammonia, N \u2026 H3, is a gas. It becomes a liquid if cooled below -28 degrees F, and will freeze into a solid once below -108 degrees F. Household ammonia is liquid at room temperature; it is a solution of ammonia in water.\n[18] Under normal atmospheric pressure, nitrogen can exist as a liquid between the temperatures of 63 K and 77.2 K. (-346\u00b0F and -320.44\u00b0F). Below 63 K, nitrogen freezes and becomes a solid. Above 77.2 K, nitrogen boils and becomes a gas.

It also burns very fast and has a higher ignition temperature than gasoline (gasoline is between 228 and 500, hydrogen is 550).\n[3] Absolute zero, 0 K, which is equivalent to \u2013273\u00ba C, is the lowest theoretical temperature a material can have. Other than the placement of the zero point, the Kelvin and Celsius scales are the same, so water freezes at 273 K and boils at 373 K.\n[4] Liquid water exists based on the molecular structure of the water, and the temperature of those molecules. Liquid water is water, H2O within a temperature range of 0-100 degre\u2026es celsius. The H20 compounds cling to other H20 compounds due to gravity, and a large amount of H2O compound form molecules of water.\n[5] We are typically used to atmospheric pressure. Therefore, we expect water to be a liquid at room temperature, to freeze to a solid below 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 deg Celsius), and to boil into the gas phase above 212 deg F (100 deg C).\n[6] Hydrogen chloride. Hydrogen chloride, (HCl), a compound of the elements hydrogen and chlorine, a gas at room temperature and pressure. A solution of the gas in water is called hydrochloric acid. 1 Hydrogen chloride may be formed by the direct combination of chlorine (Cl2) gas and hydrogen (H2) gas; the reaction is rapid at temperatures above 250\u00b0 C (482\u00b0 F). 2 Hydrochloric acid is prepared by dissolving gaseous hydrogen chloride in water.\n[7] Water is 100 C. A liquid becomes a gas when the heat no longer raises the temperature but uses the heat energy to break apart in \u2026 termolecular forces. So basically there is no single answer for all liquids. However, the name of the temperature is the boiling point.nder normal atmospheric pressure oxygen is a liquid at temperatures ranging from -218.79 degrees Celsius to -182.96 degrees Celsius. This works out to -361.82 degrees Fah \u2026 renheit to -297.33 degrees Fahrenheit. 2 people found this useful.\n[8] Liquid nitrogen. Liquid nitrogen is nitrogen in a liquid state at an extremely low temperature. It is a colorless clear liquid with a density of 0.807 g/ml at its boiling point (\u2212195.79 \u00b0C (77 K; \u2212320 \u00b0F)) and a dielectric constant of 1.43.\n[9] Liquid oxygen is a cryogenic liquid. Cryogenic liquids are liquefied gases that have a normal boiling point below \u2013130\u00b0F (\u201390\u00b0C). Liquid oxygen has a boiling point of \u2013297\u00b0F (\u2013183\u00b0C). Because the temperature difference between the product and the surrounding environment is substantial\u2014even in the winter\u2014keeping liquid oxygen insulated from the surrounding heat is essential. The product also requires special equipment for handling and storage.\n[10] Hydrofluoric acid is the aqueous solution of hydrogen fluoride which is gas at room temperature (boiling point: 19 C). The pure hydrogen fluoride is a strong acid, it reacts violently with bases and is corrosive. It reacts violently with metals, glass, some forms of plastic, rubber, and coatings. HF exists in complex of H 6 F 6, due to hydrogen binding. The aqueous solution of hydrogen fluoride (hydrofluoric acid) is a weak acid as the high strength of hydrogen-fluorine bonds does not allow complete are dissociation with water. It is a highly corrosive, fuming, and Hazardous substance that liquid and vapor can cause severe burns.\n[11] Under normal atmospheric pressure, nitrogen can exist as a liquid between the temperatures of 63 K and 77.2 K.

Under extremely high pressure it can become a liquid metal.\n[2] The electronegativity difference between the oxygen and hydrogen atoms in water molecules is responsible for the establishing of hydrogen bonds between molecules. It is the mutual attraction of water molecules that accounts for the ability of water to remain liquid over a broad range of temperature (0oC-100oC) and also for its high heat of vaporization and high heat capacity.\n[3] Hydrogen is also prevalent on Earth in the form of chemical compounds such as hydrocarbons and water. Hydrogen has one one proton and one electron; the most common isotope, protium (H), has no neutrons. Hydrogen has a melting point of -259.14 \u00b0C and a boiling point of -252.87 \u00b0C.\n[4] a transparent, odorless, tasteless liquid, a compound of hydrogen and oxygen, H 2 O, freezing at 32\u00b0F or 0\u00b0C and boiling at 212\u00b0F or 100\u00b0C, that in a more or less impure state constitutes rain, oceans, lakes, rivers, etc.: it contains 11.188 percent hydrogen and 88.812 percent oxygen, by weight.\n[5] Hydrogen is the absolute smallest of all elements, so small that four billion, laid end to end, could fit on the head of one pin! At room temperature hydrogen is a clear gas. Hydrogen gas (H 2) is a molecule made of two hydrogen atoms bonded together.\n[6] When you combine two atoms of hydrogen with one atom of oxygen you get a water molecule H 2O. Like nitrogen, hydrogen can also be condensed to a liquid that freezes at \u2013 259\u00b0C (-434\u00b0F) and boils at -252\u00b0C (-423\u00b0F). Hydrogen is one of the most common elements in our universe.The sun and many stars are made of hydrogen. It can also be found in the earth's crust.very compound has certain features and a chemical formula. Water, for example, is a compound that has two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom in it. Its chemical formula is H 2O. When sodium (Na) combines with chlorine (Cl) you get a compound called salt (NaCl).\n[7] The hydrogen ion concentration in pure water around room temperature is about 1.0 \u00d7 10-7 M. A pH of 7 is considered neutral, because the concentration of hydrogen ions is exactly equal to the concentration of hydroxide (OH-) ions produced by dissociation of the water.\n[8] Liquid nitrogen is a cryogenic liquid. Cryogenic liquids are liquefied gases that have a normal boiling point below \u2013130\u00b0F. (\u201390\u00b0C). Liquid nitrogen has a boiling point of \u2013320\u00b0F (\u2013196\u00b0C).

However, none of these can hydrogen bond, and that is why they are gases, whereas water is a liquid. Of course, at high temperatures water is a gas (steam) and at low temperatures water is a solid (ice). See the Web Links for more information about intermolecular forces.

It is a colorless, extremely poisonous and flammable liquid that boils slightly above room temperature, at 25.6 \u00b0C (78.1 \u00b0F).\n[5] Liquid hydrogen is non-corrosive. Special materials of construction are not required to prevent corrosion. However, because of its extremely cold temperature, equipment must be designed and manufactured of material, which is suitable for extremely low temperature operation.\n[6] Hydrogen cyanide, also called formonitrile (HCN), a highly volatile, colourless, and extremely poisonous liquid (boiling point 26\u00b0 C [79\u00b0 F], freezing point -14\u00b0 C [7\u00b0 F]). A solution of hydrogen cyanide in water is called hydrocyanic acid, or prussic acid.\n[7] The density of liquid hydrogen is only 70.99 g/L (at 20 K), a relative density of just 0.07. Although the specific energy is around twice that of other fuels, this gives it a remarkably low volumetric energy density, many fold lower.\n[8] The lowest layer is made up of water clouds, and mean temperatures here are at the freezing point of water \u2013 zero degrees Celsius. At the core, however, temperatures can reach as high as 11,700\u00b0 C. Scientists believe that its great internal heat is due to the sinking of helium from the upper atmosphere through the liquid hydrogen at the interior.\n[9] Hydrogen cyanide is a colorless or pale-blue liquid at room temperature.

Hydrogen cyanide gas mixes well with air, and explosive mixtures are easily formed.\n[10] Hydrogen Bonding Water is a liquid at room temperature due to the presence of hydrogen bonds between water molecules.

There are many important consequences of the effects of hydrogen bonding between water molecules: 1 Hydrogen bonding makes ice less dense than liquid water, so ice floats on water. 2 The effect of hydrogen bonding on heat of vaporization helps make perspiration an effective means of lowering temperature for animals.\n[20] Hydrogen Bonding Water is a liquid at room temperature due to the presence of hydrogen bonds between water molecules. The state of a molecule is determined by intermo\u2026lecular forces, such as dipole-dipole interactions, Van der Waals forces (also called London dispersion forces), and hydrogen bonds.\nSearch Query: hydrogen is a liquid below what temperature.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Health Poverty Action believes that everyone has the right to health. But making that right a reality is about more than ensuring everyone can visit a clinic or doctor. A multitude of different social, economic and cultural factors determine a person's health. This means that people living in the same community, or people of the same age, can have vastly different chances of good health.\n[19] Social Determinants of Infant and Child Health. The social determinants that influence maternal health also affect pregnancy outcomes and infant health. Racial and ethnic disparities in infant mortality exist, particularly for African American infants.\n[20] Research has suggested that the health effects of social relationships may be as important as risk factors such as smoking, physical activity, obesity and high blood pressure. Socially disadvantaged people and socially isolated people continue to be at increased risk for negative health outcomes.ocial inclusion (and exclusion) is one such social determinant. Support from families, friends and communities is associated with better health. The caring and respect that occurs in social relationships, and the resulting sense of satisfaction and well-being, seem to act as a buffer against health problems.\nSearch Query: what are the social determinants of health.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

These circumstances are shaped by the distribution of money, power and resources at global, national and local levels. The social determinants of health are mostly responsible for health inequities - the unfair and avoidable differences in health status seen within and between countries. Key concepts\n[2] Social determinants of health reflect the social factors and physical conditions of the environment in which people are born, live, learn, play, work, and age. Also known as social and physical determinants of health, they impact a wide range of health, functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes.\n[3] The social determinants of health (SDH) are the social and economic factors that influence people's health. These are apparent in the living and working conditions that people experience every day. The SDH influence health in many positive and negative ways.he social gradient not only represents the effects of income on health but also the importance of income as a means of gaining access to other social determinants of health such as education, food, housing, recreational activities, and other societal resources.\n[4] What are the social 'determinants' of health? The social determinants of health are the circumstances in which people are born, grow up, live, work and age, and the systems put in place to deal with illness. These circumstances are in turn shaped by a wider set of forces: economics, social policies, and politics.\n[5] Determinants of health are factors that contribute to a person's current state of health.

The social determinants of health (SDOH) are the economic and social conditions and their distribution among the population that influence individual and group differences in health status.\n[2] social determinants of health. A generic term for the social factors which affect the health of an individual\u2014e.g., housing, employment, income, education, family coherency, etc.\n[3] The social determinants of health (SDOH) are defined by the idea that health is determined by the social, economic, and physical environments in which people live and work, as well as by individuals' particular\n[4] The social determinants of health (SDOH) are linked to the economic and social conditions and their distribution among the population that influence individual and group differences in health status.\n[5] \u00a9 Zoltan Balogh. The social determinants of health (SDH) are the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age, and the wider set of forces and systems shaping the conditions of daily life. These forces and systems include economic policies and systems, development agendas, social norms, social policies and political systems.\n[6] Social determinants of health reflect the social factors and physical conditions of the environment in which people are born, live, learn, play, work, and age. Also known as social and physical determinants of health, they impact a wide range of health, functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes. Examples of social determinants include: Availability of resources to meet daily needs, such as educational and job opportunities, living wages, or healthful foods.\n[7] The social determinants of health are linked to the economic and social conditions and their distribution among the population that influence individual and group differences in health status. They are health promoting factors found in one's living and working conditions, rather than individual risk factors that influence the risk for a disease, or vulnerability to disease or injury. According to some viewpoints, the distributions of social determinants are shaped by public policies that reflect\n[8] \u00a9 Zoltan Balogh. The social determinants of health (SDH) are the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age, and the wider set of forces and systems shaping the conditions of daily life.\n[9] Social Determinants of Health. The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines the social determinants of health as the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age. These circumstances are shaped by the distribution of money, power and resources at global, national and local levels.\n[10] Social determinants of health are economic and social conditions that influence the health of people and communities (1). These conditions are shaped by the amount of money, power, and resources that people have, all of which are influenced by policy choices.Social determinants of health affect factors that are related to health outcomes.eterminants of health are factors that contribute to a person's current state of health. These factors may be biological, socioeconomic, psychosocial, behavioral, or social in nature. Scientists generally recognize five determinants of health of a population [2, 3]: 1 Genes and biology: for example, sex and age.\n[11] What are the social 'determinants' of health? The social determinants of health are the circumstances in which people are born, grow up, live, work and age, and the systems put in place to deal with illness. These circumstances are in turn shaped by a wider set of forces: economics, social policies, and politics.\n[12] Social determinants of health are economic and social conditions that influence the health of people and communities (1). These conditions are shaped by the amount of money, power, and resources that people have, all of which are influenced by policy choices.hese social determinants of health also interact with and influence individual behaviors as well. More specifically, social determinants of health refer to the set of factors that contribute to the social patterning of health, disease, and illness.\n[13] About social determinants of health The social determinants of health are the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age. These circumstances are shaped by the distribution of money, power and resources at global, national and local levels. The social determinants of health are mostly responsible for health inequities - the unfair and avoidable differences in health status seen within and between countries. Key concepts\n[14] Social Determinants of Health. The complex, integrated, and overlapping social structures and economic systems that are responsible for most health inequities. These social structures and economic systems include the social environment, physical environment, health services, and structural and societal factors. Social determinants of health are shaped by the distribution of money, power, and resources throughout local communities, nations, and the world (9). Socioeconomic Gradient in Health This term refers to the stepwise fashion health outcomes improve as socioeconomic position improves.\n[15] The social determinants of health (SDH) are the social and economic factors that influence people's health. These are apparent in the living and working conditions that people experience every day. The SDH influence health in many positive and negative ways.he social gradient not only represents the effects of income on health but also the importance of income as a means of gaining access to other social determinants of health such as education, food, housing, recreational activities, and other societal resources.\n[16] Social determinants of health affect factors that are related to health outcomes. Factors related to health outcomes include: 1 How a person develops during the first few years of life (early childhood development). 2 How much education a persons obtains. 3 Being able to get and keep a job.hese social determinants of health also interact with and influence individual behaviors as well.

We will then see that 15% is 10% plus 5%). The next step in understanding percent is knowing what it means to say that they are parts of 100%. Since 50% is half of 100%, then 50% means half.Since 25% is a quarter of 100%, 25% means a quarter. 20% means a fifth.And so on: Lesson 15.hen the percent is less than or equal to 100%, then we can say out of 100. 32% is 32 out of 100. But to say that 200% is 200 out of 100 makes no sense. 200% is 200 for each 100, which is to say, twice as much. 200% of 12 is 24. Example 2. 100 people were surveyed, and 65 responded Yes.\n[2] Percent Increase Problem: You need to calculate percent % increase from 5% to 15%. First Step: find the difference between two percentages, in this case, it's 15% - 5% = 10%. Second: Take 10 percent, and divide by 2nd percentage: 10/5 = 2.

If we think of a quantity being divided into one hundred equal parts, that is, into hundredths, then a percent is a number of hundredths. 32% is 32 hundredths. When the percent is less than or equal to 100%, then we can say out of 100. 32% is 32 out of 100.\n[9] Online Calculators: Calculate Percentage.

Lower-half length percentage is the length of a pair of lower-half facets expressed as a percentage of the girdle-to-culet distance. The average of eight lower-half length percentages is reported to the nearest five percent (5%).\n[12] 100%, then, represents the whole. When you are trying to figure out what percentage is of something, you simply divide the numerator by the denominator and multiply it by 100. So if the equation was 2/3=what percent...\n[13] When the percent is less than or equal to 100%, then we can say out of 100. 25% is 25 out of 100.

Example 2. 100 people were surveyed, and 65 responded Yes.0% is another way of saying half because 50% means 50 for each 100, which is half. 50% of 12 is 6. A percent means how many for each 100.\n[15] For, a percent is a number of hundredths. 5 is 5 hundredths -- 5% -- of 100. That is the ratio of 5 to 100.\n[16] To accomplish certain written calculations, however, it is useful to represent a percent by a number. And since a percent is how many for each 100 -- 24% is 24 for each 100 -- a percent is a number of hundredths. 24% is 24 hundredths.0% is another way of saying half because 50% means 50 for each 100, which is half. 50% of 12 is 6.

Whole numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, ...) count whole things -- like a whole pizza. You can use a percentages to count part of the pizza. Half of a pizza would be 50% of a pizza. One-fourth of a pizza would be 25% of a pizza.\n[2] Percent is actually per cent, meaning out of a hundred. (It comes from the Latin per centumfor thoroughly hundred.)

For example, 1:4 can be written as 25: 100 or 25%, 3: 8 can be written as 37.5: 100 or 37.5%, 3: 2 can be written as 150: 100 or 150%, and so on. IMPORTANT CONCEPTS ASSOCIATED WITH PERCENTAGE. Basic formula of percentage:\n[5] What is 50 percent of 25 percent? (50/100)(25/100) = (12 and one-half) percent, or 125/1000 = 1/8 in fraction terms.8.75 25% off of 25 = 25% discount applied to 25 = 25 - (25% * 25) = 25 - (0.25 * 25) = 25 - 6.25 = 18.75. 19 people found this useful.\n[6] A percentile (or a centile) is a measure used in statistics indicating the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations fall. For example, the 20th percentile is the value (or score) below which 20% of the observations may be found. The term percentile and the related term percentile rank are often used in the reporting of scores from norm-referenced tests.\n[7] One percent of anything means one-hundredth, that is, one part of any hundred equal parts. So, 1 percent of 1000 is 10; \u2026 1 percent of 100 is 1; 1 percent of 50 is .05; 1 percent of 10 is .01, and so on; or, in dollar terms, 1 percent of $100 is $1, and so on.\n[8] Here are the states with the lowest percentages: 1 South Carolina (2.1%) 2 North Carolina (3.0%) 3 Utah (3.9%) 4 Georgia (4.0%) 5 Texas (4.5%)\n[9] The first quartile is also known as 25th percentile, the second quartile as 50th percentile, and the third quartile as 75th percentile. (A percentile is the value of a variable below which a certain percent of observations fall) The Interquartile range is from Q1 to Q3.\n[10] Think like this: 1 There are some percentages that are easy to calculate mentally. 2 50% means half, 25% means 1/4 and 75% means 3/4. 3 Finding 10% of a number is one of the most useful and also one of the easiest. 4 To find 10% all we need to do is move/shift the decimal one place to the left.\n[11] III% Club Merchandise & III% Logo Gear.

Specifically the percentile represents the percentage of the sample that falls below this observation. For example, the median is also known as the. 50th percentile because half of the data or 50% of the observations lie below the median. Table 4.4 displays three percentiles that will be of interest to us. Figure 4.7 shows these percentiles (quartiles) graphically. Table 4.4.\n[13] Over the long term, the Three-Fifths Compromise did not work as the South anticipated. Since the northern states grew more rapidly than the South, by 1820, southern representation in the House had fallen to 42 percent.\n[14] The percent of responders that are detractors are subtracted from the percent of responders that are promoters.. The result is the net promoter score (NPS). The top 10 NPS leaders are dominated by USAA and Apple: 1 USAA - Insurance = 80%. USAA - Banking = 78%.\n[15] The Fibonacci Studies and Finance. When used in technical analysis, the golden ratio is typically translated into three percentages: \u2013 38.2%, 50% and 61.8%. However, more multiples can be used when needed, such as 23.6%, 161.8%, 423% and so on.\n[16] 100%, then, represents the whole. When you are trying to figure out what percentage is of something, you simply divide the numerator by the denominator and multiply it by 100. So if the equation was 2/3=what percent...\n[17] 32% -- 32 for each 100. If we think of a quantity being divided into one hundred equal parts, that is, into hundredths, then a percent is a number of hundredths. 32% is 32 hundredths. When the percent is less than or equal to 100%, then we can say out of 100. 32% is 32 out of 100.\n[18] Answer. 32% -- 32 for each 100. If we think of a quantity being divided into one hundred equal parts, that is, into hundredths, then a percent is a number of hundredths. 32% is 32 hundredths. When the percent is less than or equal to 100%, then we can say out of 100. 32% is 32 out of 100.\n[19] 0.85 = 85%. We can find any percent of a given number by changing the percent to a decimal and multiplying. One hundred percent of a number is just the number itself. Two hundred percent of a number is twice that number.\n[20] 6 percent retention rate in 2004, which is an improvement of about a percentage point over the first three years of the decade (and the same rate as in 2003).

So: 26% = 26/100 = 13/50 As a decimal, 26/100 = .26 .13 = 13/100 = 13% I'll let you do the third.\n[2] When the percent is less than or equal to 100%, then we can say out of 100. 5% is 5 out of 100. 12% is 12 out of 100.\n[3] When the percent is less than or equal to 100%, then we can say out of 100. 25% is 25 out of 100. But 250% cannot mean 250 out of 100 -- that makes no sense. It means 250 for each 100, which is two and a half times.or, a percent is a number of hundredths. 5 is 5 hundredths -- 5% -- of 100. That is the ratio of 5 to 100.\n[4] 1 A percent is the number of parts out of 100 of something. 2 For example, a quarter (25 cents) is 25 percent of a dollar (100 cents). 3 It is the numerator of a fraction whose denominator is 100. 4 So, the fraction 25/100 is 25. Percent. 2 A percent is the number of parts out of 100 of something. 3 For example, a quarter (25 cents) is 25 percent of a dollar (100 cents). 4 It is the numerator of a fraction whose denominator is 100.\n[5] 1 There are some percentages that are easy to calculate mentally. 2 50% means half, 25% means 1/4 and 75% means 3/4. 3 Finding 10% of a number is one of the most useful and also one of the easiest. 4 To find 10% all we need to do is move/shift the decimal one place to the left.\n[6] One of the most frequent ways to represent statistics is by percentage. Percent simply means per hundred and the symbol used to express percentage is %. One percent (or 1%) is one hundredth of the total or whole and is therefore calculated by dividing the total or whole number by 100.\n[7] 1% is 1 out of 100 or 1/100 or 0.01 in decimal form. One percent of anything means one-hundredth, that is, one part of any hundred equal parts. So, 1 percent of 1000 is 10; \u2026 1 percent of 100 is 1; 1 percent of 50 is .05; 1 percent of 10 is .01, and so on; or, in dollar terms, 1 percent of $100 is $1, and so on.\n[8] 1 It is the numerator of a fraction whose denominator is 100. percent, sometimes written as 25%. If you have a decimal number, like .72 and you want to convert it to a percent, you just multiply it by 100. So the decimal .72 becomes (100 X .72) = 72 percent.\n[9] Seventy-two percent of B2C marketers said they are producing more content now, compared with a year ago. That number is even higher for the most effective marketers (77 percent) and those who have a documented content marketing strategy (81 percent).\n[10] Percent Increase Problem: You need to calculate percent % increase from 5% to 15%. First Step: find the difference between two percentages, in this case, it's 15% - 5% = 10%. Second: Take 10 percent, and divide by 2nd percentage: 10/5 = 2.\n[11] III% Club Merchandise & III% Logo Gear.

Table 4.4 displays three percentiles that will be of interest to us. Figure 4.7 shows these percentiles (quartiles) graphically. Table 4.4.\n[13] A percentile (or a centile) is a measure used in statistics indicating the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations fall. For example, the 20th percentile is the value (or score) below which 20% of the observations may be found. The term percentile and the related term percentile rank are often used in the reporting of scores from norm-referenced tests.\n[14] The first quartile is also known as 25th percentile, the second quartile as 50th percentile, and the third quartile as 75th percentile. (A percentile is the value of a variable below which a certain percent of observations fall) The Interquartile range is from Q1 to Q3.\n[15] (In Lesson 16, Question 12, we will see that 5% is half of 10%, and so it will be very easy to take 5%. We will then see that 15% is 10% plus 5%). The next step in understanding percent is knowing what it means to say that they are parts of 100%.Since 50% is half of 100%, then 50% means half. Since 25% is a quarter of 100%, 25% means a quarter. 20% means a fifth. And so on: Lesson 15.In Lesson 16, Question 12, we will see that 5% is half of 10%, and so it will be very easy to take 5%.

The next step in understanding percent is knowing what it means to say that they are parts of 100%.\n[16] Percents are like fractions and decimals because they count PART of something. Whole numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, ...) count whole things -- like a whole pizza. You can use a percentages to count part of the pizza. Half of a pizza would be 50% of a pizza. One-fourth of a pizza would be 25% of a pizza.\n[17] 100%, then, represents the whole.

In mathematics, we use the symbol % for percent.\n[5] To get the percentage of 3/5, FIRST, divide 100% by the denominator, which is 5, to get 20%. SECOND, multiply 3 by 20%, which would give us 60%. That's it. I hope this helped.\n[6] Percentage is per-cent which means parts per hundred. One percent is equal to 1/100 fraction: 1% = 1/100 = 0.01. Ten percent is equal to 10/100 fraction: 10% = 10/100 = 0.1. Fifty percent is equal to 50/100 fraction: 50% = 50/100 = 0.5.\n[7] A percent is the number of parts out of 100 of something. For example, a quarter (25 cents) is 25 percent of a dollar (100 cents). It is the numerator of a fraction whose denominator is 100. So, the fraction 25/100 is 25.\n[8] We will then see that 15% is 10% plus 5%). The next step in understanding percent is knowing what it means to say that they are parts of 100%. Since 50% is half of 100%, then 50% means half. Since 25% is a quarter of 100%, 25% means a quarter. 20% means a fifth.\n[9] When the percent is less than or equal to 100%, then we can say out of 100. 5% is 5 out of 100. 12% is 12 out of 100. But 250% cannot mean 250 out of 100. That makes no sense. It means 250 for each 100, which is two and a half times (Lesson 15).\n[10] Thus, rounding to two decimal places, \u22123 is the 0.13th percentile, \u22122 the 2.28th percentile, \u22121 the 15.87th percentile, 0 the 50th percentile (both the mean and median of the distribution), +1 the 84.13th percentile, +2 the 97.72nd percentile, and +3 the 99.87th percentile.\n[11] A loose affiliation of like minded Americans who vow to refuse to comply with laws that violate the second amendment right to keep (own) and bear (carry) firearms.

The lowest federal share occurs in Alaska at 20.0 percent, followed by North Dakota (20.5 percent), Virginia (23.5 percent), Hawaii (23.5 percent), and Connecticut (23.6 percent).\n[15] A percentile (or a centile) is a measure used in statistics indicating the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations fall. For example, the 20th percentile is the value (or score) below which 20% of the observations may be found. The term percentile and the related term percentile rank are often used in the reporting of scores from norm-referenced tests.\n[16] The first quartile is also known as 25th percentile, the second quartile as 50th percentile, and the third quartile as 75th percentile. (A percentile is the value of a variable below which a certain percent of observations fall) The Interquartile range is from Q1 to Q3.\n[17] The third quartile is the place where three fourths of the data lies below it. The median, first quartile and third quartile can all be stated in terms of percentiles. Since half of the data is less than the median, and one half is equal to 50%, we could call the median the 50th percentile. One fourth is equal to 25%, and so the first quartile the 25th percentile.\n[18] Percents are like fractions and decimals because they count PART of something. Whole numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, ...) count whole things -- like a whole pizza. You can use a percentages to count part of the pizza. Half of a pizza would be 50% of a pizza. One-fourth of a pizza would be 25% of a pizza.\n[19] 32% -- 32 for each 100. If we think of a quantity being divided into one hundred equal parts, that is, into hundredths, then a percent is a number of hundredths. 32% is 32 hundredths. When the percent is less than or equal to 100%, then we can say out of 100. 32% is 32 out of 100.\n[20] 1% is 1 out of 100 or 1/100 or 0.01 in decimal form. One percent of anything means one-hundredth, that is, one part of any hundred equal parts. So, 1 percent of 1000 is 10; \u2026 1 percent of 100 is 1; 1 percent of 50 is .05; 1 percent of 10 is .01, and so on; or, in dollar terms, 1 percent of $100 is $1, and so on.\nSearch Query: what are the three percenters?.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

They include. ovarian cysts, prostatitis, ectopic pregnancy, can-. cer, infections, or gastrointestinal inflammations. such as Crohn's disease or diverticulitis. Thus, illness must be ruled out.\n[8] Organs in your pelvis include your bowel, bladder, womb (uterus) and ovaries. Pelvic pain usually means pain that starts from one of these organs. In some cases the pain comes from your pelvic bones that lie next to these organs, or from nearby muscles, nerves, blood vessels or joints. So, there are many causes of pelvic pain. Pelvic pain is more common in women than in men.\n[9] Other specific conditions affecting internal organs that can sometimes cause right upper back pain, with or without pain near the involved organ, include: -- kidney infection and kidney stone -- appendicitis -- tear or constriction of the esophagus -- ovarian cyst or twisting of the ovary -- infection of the ovarian tubes -- pregnancy in the ovarian tubes, known as a tubal or ectopic pregnancy\n[10] Other causes in women or men Examples of other possible causes of pelvic pain \u2014 in women or men \u2014 include: 1 Appendicitis. 2 Colon cancer. 3 Chronic constipation. 4 Crohn's disease. 5 Diverticulitis.\n[11] Causes of Right Hip Pain. Due to the close proximity of organs in the abdominal and pelvic cavity, it is not always possible to isolate a specific organ when pain occurs at a particular region. Therefore the most common conditions of the nearest organs to this area needs to be considered. Pain may arise from the hip joint itself or the pelvic bone but there are also other possible conditions as discussed below. Abdominal wall pain is one of the common but often neglected causes of right hip pain. The pain may arise with trauma to the abdominal wall or with muscle strain. The pain is typically superficial and aggravated with movement or touch.\n[12] Causes of Pain on the Right Side of the Waist. Pain along the waist line may be caused by abnormal function of any of the organs in the pelvic region of the body.

There are many causes of pelvic pain in women including uterine fibroids, cysts, PMS, appendicitis, bladder infections, and unusual vulvar pain. Pelvic pain has symptoms that can be uncomfortable, but luckily there are treatments for pelvic pain.\n[16] Pelvic pain can be acute and sudden in onset, or the pain can be chronic and longstanding, depending on the specific cause. The characteristics of the pain -- location, timing, duration, etc., are important in diagnosing its cause along with any associated symptoms such as vaginal discharge or bleeding. Some types of pelvic pain may only be apparent at certain times, such as during sexual activity or during urination. Persisting pelvic pain should be evaluated by a physician. Pelvic pain may arise due to infections, trauma, tumors, or conditions affecting the muscles and nerves of the pelvis.\n[17] Pelvic pain is pain in the lowest part of your abdomen and pelvis. In women, pelvic pain may refer to symptoms arising from the reproductive or urinary systems or from musculoskeletal sources. Depending on its source, pelvic pain may be dull or sharp; it may be constant or off and on (intermittent); and it may be mild, moderate or severe. Pelvic pain can sometimes radiate to your lower back, buttocks or thighs. Pelvic pain can occur suddenly, sharply and briefly (acute) or over the long term (chronic). Chronic pelvic pain refers to any constant or intermittent pelvic pain that has been present for more than a few months. Sometimes, you may notice pelvic pain only at certain times, such as when you urinate or during sexual activity. 1 Causes.\n[18] The pelvis is the lowest part of your tummy (abdomen).

They can be separated by when they tend to happen, if you are pregnant and if they are accompanied by other symptoms such as vaginal bleeding.The most common causes are mentioned below.elvic pain is more common in women than in men. This leaflet will deal with the most common causes of pelvic pain in women. Pelvic pain can be acute or chronic. Acute means that it is the first time you have had this type of pain. Chronic means that pain has been a problem for a long time-more than six months.\n[19] Some causes of chronic pelvic pain include: 1 Endometriosis. This is a condition in which tissue from the lining of your womb (uterus) grows outside your uterus. 2 Tension in your pelvic floor muscles. Spasms or tension in the pelvic floor muscles can lead to recurring pelvic pain. 3 Chronic pelvic inflammatory disease.\n[20] There are many causes of pelvic pain in women including uterine fibroids, cysts, PMS, appendicitis, bladder infections, and unusual vulvar pain.

The sigmoid colon derives its name from the fact that it is curved in the form of an S (Greek sigma: \u03c3). Its size depends upon the amount of waste material in it, but when contracted its diameter is only about one inch (2.5 centimetres). The internal surface of the sigmoid colon is similar to that of the rest of the large intestine. The smooth mucous membrane lining secretes mucus and enzymes, and the lining's surface cells can absorb fluids.

The sigmoid colon derives its name from the fact that it is curved in the form of an S (Greek sigma: \u03c3).\n[9] Scale-invariant feature transform (or SIFT) is an algorithm in computer vision to detect and describe local features in images.The algorithm was published by David Lowe in 1999.he detection and description of local image features can help in object recognition. The SIFT features are local and based on the appearance of the object at particular interest points, and are invariant to image scale and rotation.\n[10] Did You Know? The shape sense of sigmoid is most often used in scientific contexts to describe an s-shaped curve on a graph. Usually, though, sigmoid is used in contexts relating to the sigmoid colon-the contracted and crooked part of the colon immediately above the rectum. Sigmoid comes from sigma, the name of the 18th letter of the Greek alphabet.\n[11] \uf0b7 SIGMET 1 is the type of the message and the sequential number of the day; \uf0b7 VALID 150435/150835 is the period of validity of the message.

(mathematics) Exhibiting logistic growth; having a graph that accelerates until it reaches a carrying capacity.\n[8] When significant flight/weather events are observed or forecast, then a SIGMET is issued by the office responsible (Bracknell for London, Scottish and the Shanwick Oceanic FIR's (Flight Information Regions); Dublin for the Shannon FIR) for such as embedded (EMBD) or frequent (FRQ) cumulonimbus (CB) or thunderstorms (TS); severe icing (SEV ICE) in ...\n[9] The header of the SIGMET message contains the type of the message, issuing country or territory, bulletin. number, creator of the message (generally the FIR where the observation/forecast is in) and the date/time. of the dissemination of the message.\n[10] Medical Definition of Sigmoid. Sigmoid: In human anatomy, the lower colon (the lower portion of the large bowel). Sigmoid is short for sigmoid colon. From the Greek letter sigma, which is shaped like a C. Sigmoid also means curved in two directions like the letter S. For example, a sigmoid curve is an S-shaped curve. Search MedTerms:\n[11] A weather advisory concerning convective weather significant to the safety of all aircraft. Convective SIGMETs are issued for tornadoes, lines of thunderstorms, embedded thunderstorms of any intensity level, areas of thunderstorms greater than or equal to VIP level 4 with an area coverage of 4/10 (40%) or more, and hail 3/4 inch or greater.\n[12] The first line of the SIGMET message contains the referred area of the observation/forecast (or where the. observation/forecast is issued to), the identifier and daily sequence number, the period of validity. (beginning and ending) and the station that made the observation/forecast which originated the message.\n[13] The criteria for a non-convective SIGMET to be issued are severe or greater turbulence over a 3,000-square-mile (7,800 km2) area, or severe or greater icing over a 3,000-square-mile (7,800 km2) area or IMC conditions over a 3,000-square-mile (7,800 km2) area due to dust, sand, or volcanic ash (1).\n[14] Sigmoid colon The sigmoid colon is the part of the large intestine after the descending colon and before the rectum. The name sigmoid means S-shaped (see sigmoid). The walls o\u2026f the sigmoid colon are muscular, and contract to increase the pressure inside the colon, causing the stool to move into the rectum.\n[15] Sigmoid colon. Sigmoid colon, a terminal section of the large intestine that connects the descending colon to the rectum; its function is to store fecal wastes until they are ready to leave the body. The sigmoid colon derives its name from the fact that it is curved in the form of an S (Greek sigma: \u03c3).\n[16] The sigmoid colon is a curved, S-shaped region of the large intestine and is the final segment of the colon. It transports fecal matter from the descending colon to the rectum and anus. Feces are stored in the sigmoid colon until they are ready to be eliminated from the body through the anal canal.\n[17] Sigmoidoscopy. A sigmoidoscopy is a screening or diagnostic test that allows a doctor to see inside the lower 20 inches of the sigmoid colon and rectum (also called the large intestine). It is frequently used as a screening test to find polyps, which are small growths that may become cancer.\n[18] A sigmoid polyp is an abnormal collection of cells that grows in the sigmoid portion of the colon. This is the area of the colon that is closest to the rectum. In most cases, a sigmoid polyp is found to be non-cancerous, although the risk of cancer increases as the polyp grows larger. There are several different types of polyps that may be found in this area of the colon, including adenomatous polyps, hyperplastic polyps, and benign colon polyps.\n[19] sigmoid colon.

Cold-blooded animals have to warm themselves up (usually by sunning them selves or by vibrating their muscles) before they become active while warmblooded animals are already warm and ready for action. Also warmblooded animals can operate at temperatures where cold-blooded animals can not (eg polar bears). -------------------------------------------------------------- Warm Blooded try to keep the inside of their bodies at a constant temperature.\n[2] What is Warm Blooded?? We are warm blooded animals, so are all other mammals, to a certain extent, and birds. However warm blood is not really the question, many reptiles have blood far warmer than ours, but only on hot days. In fact, blood temperature is merely a reflection of body temperature.\n[3] What are some warm-blooded animals? A: A list of warm-blooded animals would include all mammals and birds (with very few exceptions), such as apes, monkeys, whales, elephants, cheetahs, giraffes, dogs, cats, pigs and humans. All reptiles, amphibians, fish and insects are considered cold-blooded. Continue Reading.\n[4] Examples of cold blooded animals include fish, insects, spiders, frogs, crocodiles, bees, moths, and termites. Examples of warm blooded animals are humans, dogs, cats, elephants, monkeys, deer, moose, horses, lions, and cows.\n[5] Sharks have adapted to living in a wide range of aquatic habitats at various temperatures. While some species inhabit shallow, coastal regions, others live in deep waters, on the ocean floor and in the open ocean. Some species, like the bull shark, are even known to swim in salt, fresh and brackish waters.\n[6] What eats a shark? What do sharks eat? There are many species of sharks, from tiny, two-foot (.75 meter) sand sharks to great white sharks that can reach a length of 20 feet (6.5 meters) or more. Most sharks eat fish, octopi, squid, turtles, and other cold-blooded sea creatures, along with the occasional sea bird caught napping on the water.\n[7] Best Answer: The creatures traditionally regarded as warm-blooded have a larger number of mitochondria per cell which enables them to generate heat by increasing the rate at which they burn fats and sugars.\n[8] Cold-blooded creatures take on the temperature of their surroundings. They are hot when their environment is hot and cold when their environment is cold. In hot environmen\u2026ts, cold-blooded animals can have blood that is much warmer than warm-blooded animals. AleaIactaEst.\n[9] Humans are warm blooded..meaning we regulate our own body temperature in order to maintain homeostasis(same core body temperature of 36.9 degrees C). Whereas 'cold-blooded' animals such as reptiles use the heat from surroundings.hat means that the chemical reactions get to operate at a constant temperature. Cold blooded animals often have to warm up before they can get moving. Higher animals are warm blooded like humans. The line between cold and warm may be moving. Some scientists are suggesting that reptiles may have been warm blooded.\n[10] Sharks are harder, but some species, such as the Great White, have calcified tissue that grows in layers on their back bones, that can also be used to age the animals. But the Greenland shark is a very, very soft shark - it has no hard body parts where growth layers are deposited.\n[11] With a few exceptions all reptiles such as the lizard are cold blooded creatures. The temperature of an animal's blood (whether an animal is warm blooded or cold blooded) is related to its body temperature. Cold blooded creatures such as the lizard take on the temperature of their surroundings. In other words, they are hot when their environment is hot and cold when their environment is cold. In hot environments, cold blooded animals can have blood that is much warmer than warm blooded animals.\n[12] Tigers, like all mammals, are considered to be warm blooded as they use endothermic methods to keep their body temperature at a near constant rate. This means that they contro\u2026l their temperature via internal means, such as sweating, shivering and panting. 12 people found this useful.\n[13] Mammals and birds are warm-blooded, which means that they can make their own body heat even when it is cold outside. Whether it is sunny and hot outside or there is a snowstorm and it is very cold, warm-blooded animals have body temperatures that usually stay the same.\n[14] All mammals including all humans are warm-blooded. This means that our body temperature is regulated at least to some extent by our body and not totally by the outside temp. Cold blooded animals can only get heat from the sun or a warm surface.Warm blooded.his means that our body temperature is regulated at least to some extent by our body and not totally by the outside temp. Cold blooded animals can only get heat from the sun or a warm surface.\n[15] Whale sharks are found in warm waters in the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Despite their huge size, whale sharks feed on some of the tiniest creatures in the ocean, including crustaceans and plankton. More \u00bb. Basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus), showing head, gills and dorsal fin.\n[16] These thermal infrared images of warm-blooded animals, show how birds and mammals maintain body temperatures well above the surrounding, cooler air temperature. Cold-blooded creatures take on the temperature of their surroundings. They are hot when their environment is hot and cold when their environment is cold. In hot environments, cold-blooded animals can have blood that is much warmer than warm-blooded animals. Cold-blooded animals are much more active in warm environments and are very sluggish in cold environments.\n[17] Sharks are carnivorous and may be found in all seas. They associate humans with food. Sharks do not usually live in fresh waters, but there are exceptions: the river shark and the bull shark. Most sharks are found in 2,000 meters (7,000 ft) level, in warm environments, but they can also be seen in shallow waters.\n[18] This is because in warm-blooded animals, the heat they lose is proportional to the surface area of their bodies, while the heat they produce is proportional to their mass. This means that larger warm-blooded animals can generate more heat than they lose and they can keep their body temperatures stable more easily.\n[19] Types.

Mammals and birds are warm-blooded; snakes, lizards, other reptiles, fish and insects are cold-blooded.\n[3] Not So Cold Or Warm\u2026. Most of us learn that insects, fish, reptiles and amphibians are cold blooded because their body temperature changes along with the external temperature, while birds and mammals are warm blooded because they maintain a high body temperature regardless of the external temperature.\n[4] Cold-blooded creatures take on the temperature of their surroundings. They are hot when their environment is hot and cold when their environment is cold. In hot environmen\u2026ts, cold-blooded animals can have blood that is much warmer than warm-blooded animals.\n[5] In years with warm El Ni\u00f1o conditions, hammerhead sharks may range many hundreds of kilometres farther than normal. Some species, such as the scalloped hammerhead (S. lewini) and smooth hammerhead (S. zygaena), form large schools that may be segregated by sex or age.\n[6] What does it mean to be cold-blooded? Generally, cold-blooded animals don't use their own energy to warm themselves and maintain their bot temperature. Warm-blooded animals heat themselves with energy from food, so they need to eat more regularly tan cold-blooded animals. They only two warm-blooded groups are mammals and birds. Reptiles, amphibians, fish and invertebrates are cold-blooded.\n[7] Cold-blooded creatures take on the temperature of their surroundings. They are hot when their environment is hot and cold when their environment is cold. In hot environments, cold-blooded animals can have blood that is much warmer than warm-blooded animals.\n[8] The shark is a meat-eating fish and one of the most feared animals in the sea. There are over 300 types of sharks that live in oceans all over the world. Most of them live in warm seas but some sharks prefer colder regions like the seas around Antarctica. The first sharks lived in our oceans about 300 million years ago.\n[9] Whale sharks live in warm waters and tropical oceans around the world.

Warm-blooded creatures, like mammals and birds, try to keep the inside of their bodies at a constant temperature. They do this by generating their own heat when they are in a cooler environment, and by cooling themselves when they are in a hotter environment.\n[2] Cold-blooded animals, like reptiles, amphibians, and fish, become hotter and colder, depending on the the temperature outside. For example, when the sun sets at night, their bodies are cooler because it is less warm outside.\n[3] Warm and Cold Blooded Animals. With a few exceptions, all mammals and birds are warm-blooded, and all reptiles, insects, arachnids, amphibians and fish are cold-blooded.\n[4] Warm-blooded is used to describe animals that generate their own heat. Warm-blooded creatures are often called ectotherms.

What does it mean to be warm-blooded or cold-blooded? The temperature of an animal's blood is related to its body temperature. Warm-Blooded vs. Cold-Blooded\n[19] Animals are either cold-or warm-blooded. Cold-blooded animals' bodies are the same temperature as the air around them; warm-blooded animals' bodies maintain a regular temperature despite the air temperature. Mammals and birds are warm-blooded; snakes, lizards, other reptiles, fish and insects are cold-blooded.\n[20] What does it mean to be cold-blooded? Generally, cold-blooded animals don't use their own energy to warm themselves and maintain their bot temperature. Warm-blooded animals heat themselves with energy from food, so they need to eat more regularly tan cold-blooded animals. They only two warm-blooded groups are mammals and birds. Reptiles, amphibians, fish and invertebrates are cold-blooded.\nSearch Query: how are some sharks warm blooded.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) are huge and powerful warm-blooded fish that have been around for at least 11 million years. Also known as white pointers, their ancestors existed on Earth 400 million years ago, which is 200 million years before the first dinosaur appeared.\n[3] But the advantages of endothermy are costly. To maintain a warm body in cold water, a mackerel shark must burn fuel like a blast furnace. A warm-bodied shark may need more than ten times as much food as a cold-bodied shark of the same size.\n[4] Confidence votes 30. It depends on the type of shark, most sharks like living in warm or tropical waters,such as Hawaii and Australia.Some sharks though can live in colder waters,such as the Greenland shark and the Great White shark.The Great White Shark has even been seen in the cold waters of Sanfransisco.\n[5] Meet the Comical Opah, the Only Truly Warm-Blooded Fish. There's nothing about the opah that says \"fast-moving predator\". Tuna, sharks, and swordfish are fast-moving predators and accordingly, their bodies look like streamlined torpedoes. By contrast, the opah looks like a big startled frisbee, with thin red fins stuck on as an afterthought.\n[6] 1 Fish have a backbone. 2 They are vertebrates. 3 Fish breathe using gills. 4 They absorb oxygen through the gills. 5 Almost all fish are cold-blooded. 6 Two of the exceptions are the tuna and the Pacific salmon shark, which can raise their body temperature to some degree.\n[7] Whale sharks are found in all tropical and warm-temperate seas around the world, preferring water temperatures of 20-25\u00b0C. Whale sharks eat mostly small organisms like plankton, schooling fish, and squid, which they strain from the water as they swim with their meter-long mouths and specialized teeth.\n[8] Studies have shown that dinosaurs were not warm-blooded or cold-blooded, but had both cold-blooded and warm-blooded features with complex metabolic systems. Bats, mole rats and echidnas are also considered to be neither cold-blooded nor warm-blooded due to their varying temperatures.\n[9] While most sharks prefer warm or temperate water, one shark is built to withstand extreme cold. The Greenland shark lives in the northernmost waters of any shark \u2013 the icy seas of the Arctic Circle, where water temperatures can drop to 30\u00b0 Fahrenheit.\n[10] Quick Answer. Some examples of cold blooded animals are snakes, fish, crocodiles, lizards, frogs and turtles. As a general rule, most amphibians, reptiles and fish are cold blooded.

Sharks have a reputation as \"cold-blooded killers\" and despite how negative that term is, it's not entirely inaccurate. Sharks are by no means evil, vicious killers like that quote suggests. Nonetheless, sharks are, for the most part anyways, efficient ectothermic predators. Endo vs Ecto.\n[2] A question came across SHARK-L concerning makos being considered warm-blooded and various replies touch upon aspects of the topic. There are currently two species of mako recognized, the Longfin (Isurus paucus) and the Shortfin (I. oxyrinchus).\n[3] More on Warm-Bodied Sharks. Shortfin Mako (Isurus oxyrinchus) A question came across SHARK-L concerning makos being considered warm-blooded and various replies touch upon aspects of the topic. I responded to the original query and went onto expand upon or correct some of those responses.\n[4] Most large sharks are cold-blooded and cruise at a leisurely 1.5 mph. Because most species fare poorly in captivity, the maximum swimming speed of a shark has seldom been measured. The Blue Shark is an open ocean glider, planing on wing-like pectoral fins and flattened belly.\n[5] For many people, sharks are the epitome of the 'cold-blooded killer'. The warm-bodied mackerel sharks are spectacular reminders that many of our stereotypes are inaccurate. As apex predators, sharks are absolutely essential to the health and vigor of marine ecosystems.\n[6] Certain lamnid sharks, tuna and billfishes are also endothermic. In common parlance, endotherms are characterized as warm-blooded ..

Differences between Shark and Whale. \u2022 Sharks are fish and cold-blooded, whereas whales are warm-blooded mammals.\n[8] These sharks are unique in their ability to elevate and maintain body temperatures as much as 13 C above the ambient water temperature. One striking feature of these warm-bodied sharks is that their flanks and viscera are warm, while the heart and gills are at environmental temperatures.\n[9] The Dall's Porpoise \u2014 a chunky, hyperactive speed demon of the North Pacific \u2014 is believed to be even faster (speeds up to 34.5 mph have been reported), but since it does not fare well in captivity, it has not been trained or its speed measured. Most large sharks are cold-blooded and cruise at a leisurely 1.5 mph.\n[10] Large sharks that living in temperate waters include the great white shark, the shortfin mako shark, and the basking shark. These large temperate sharks can generate their own body heat and are therefore able to travel farther than smaller temperate sharks, which cannot.lthough large temperate sharks will travel into tropical waters, they will swim only at depths where the temperature is in their preferred range. Smaller sharks are much more affected by heat and cold and stay within their limits. Sandbar sharks like water temperature between about 15\u00b0-30\u00b0C (59&deg-86&degF).\n[11] Gruber: Mackerel sharks, including great whites, makos, threshers, and porbeagles, have a heat-conserving mechanism known as the rete mirabile (wonderful net), a structure for warming blood passing over the gills.\n[12] The Largest Great White Sharks. Great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) are huge and powerful warm-blooded fish that have been around for at least 11 million years. Also known as white pointers, their ancestors existed on Earth 400 million years ago, which is 200 million years before the first dinosaur appeared.\n[13] While most sharks prefer warm or temperate water, one shark is built to withstand extreme cold. The Greenland shark lives in the northernmost waters of any shark \u2013 the icy seas of the Arctic Circle, where water temperatures can drop to 30\u00b0 Fahrenheit.\n[14] White sharks have a unique system called a \"counter current heat exchange\", which keeps their body tempreture +/- 7C above the surrounding water temperature. All sharks have an incredibly unique system on the tip of their nose called the \"ampillae of Lorenzini\". These are small pores filled with a gel that transmits the electrical currents in the water to the shark's brain so that it can assess its environment.\n[15] Great White sharks live in all oceans except polar waters, like theSouthern Ocean and the Arctic Ocean.

It depends on the type of shark, most sharks like living in warm or tropical waters,such as Hawaii and Australia.Some sharks though can live in colder waters,such as the Greenland shark and the Great White shark.The Great White Shark has even been seen in the cold waters of Sanfransisco.\n[17] Sharks are carnivorous and may be found in all seas. They associate humans with food. Sharks do not usually live in fresh waters, but there are exceptions: the river shark and the bull shark. Most sharks are found in 2,000 meters (7,000 ft) level, in warm environments, but they can also be seen in shallow waters.\n[18] Examples of shallow water sharks are the nurse, the hammerhead, the sandbar, the great white and the tiger shark. Pelagic sharks are shortfin makos and whale sharks. Deep water sharks, such as catsharks, goblin sharks and megamouth sharks, stay in cold water all year round.lthough large temperate sharks will travel into tropical waters, they will swim only at depths where the temperature is in their preferred range.

Several species of shark and tuna have something special going on inside their bodies. For a long time, scientists have known that some fish species appear warm-blooded. Salmon sharks can elevate their body temperatures by up to 20 degrees compared to the surrounding water, for example.\n[2] Most sharks are cold-blooded. Some, like the Mako and the Great white shark, are partially warmblooded (they are endotherms). These sharks can raise their temperature about the temperature of the water; they need to have occasional short bursts of speed in hunting.\n[3] Most sharks are cold-blooded. Some, like the Mako and the Great white shark, are partially warmblooded (they are endotherms). Cold blooded although if you've ever seen a Great White Shark hunt sea lions you'd be thinking they would have to be hotblooded. Actually the Salmon Shark is a warm blooded shark.\n[4] Great white sharks are some of the only warm blooded sharks. This allows them to swim in colder waters in addition to warm, tropical waters. Great White sharks can be found as\u2026 north as Alaska and as south as the southern tip of South America. They exist worldwide, everywhere in-between. 5 people found this useful.\n[5] Are White Sharks warm-blooded or cold-blooded? White sharks are part of the fish family, so they must be 'cold-blooded', right? Actually, white sharks are much more complex than you may think. An animal that is 'cold-blooded' means their inside body temperature is dependent on the environment they are in. For example, a snake is cold blooded, so its body temperature fluctuates with the day or even whether or not they are in the sun.\n[6] White sharks are part of the fish family, so they must be 'cold-blooded', right?

Actually the Salmon Shark is a warm blooded shark.\n[8] Regardless sharks are cold blooded, they live either in warm, temperate and cold waters. Some species live mainly in cold waters, while some others prefer warmer waters. SHARK MIGRATION. One thing is for sure; sharks migrate to find new sources of food and they can travel up to hundreds of miles to do that. Most species of sharks live in the oceans. However, some of them are known to dwell in bodies of freshwater, like the bull shark which travels up to 4,000 Km up the Amazon River. Sometimes, sharks reach freshwater bodies; this could be the result of the destruction of their habitat by human activities.\n[9] The Salmon Shark is one of the warmest of the warm-bodied sharks. Measurements of its epaxial (upper back) muscles indicate that this species is able to maintain a body temperature 14 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit (8 to 11 degrees Celsius) above the ambient water temperature.\n[10] Some fish are ectothermic such as the Blue shark whereas others are endothermic such as swordfish and Lamnid sharks.ndothermic = warm-blooded Ectothermic = cold-blooded Endotherms are able to maintain their own body temperature, whereas Ectotherms rely on their environment to regulate body \u2026 temperature.\n[11] These sharks are unique in their ability to elevate and maintain body temperatures as much as 13 C above the ambient water temperature. One striking feature of these warm-bodied sharks is that their flanks and viscera are warm, while the heart and gills are at environmental temperatures.\n[12] More on Warm-Bodied Sharks. Shortfin Mako (Isurus oxyrinchus) A question came across SHARK-L concerning makos being considered warm-blooded and various replies touch upon aspects of the topic. I responded to the original query and went onto expand upon or correct some of those responses.\n[13] For many people, sharks are the epitome of the 'cold-blooded killer'. The warm-bodied mackerel sharks are spectacular reminders that many of our stereotypes are inaccurate. As apex predators, sharks are absolutely essential to the health and vigor of marine ecosystems.\n[14] Gruber: Mackerel sharks, including great whites, makos, threshers, and porbeagles, have a heat-conserving mechanism known as the rete mirabile (wonderful net), a structure for warming blood passing over the gills.\n[15] The Largest Great White Sharks.

From the Pythagorean theorem, h=sqrt(c^2-1/4(b-a)^2), (1) so A = 1/2(a+b)h (2) = 1/2(a+b)sqrt(c^2-1/4(b-a)^2).\n[2] There are two ways to do this problem \u2014 I'll go over both. Method 1: Find the area of the shaded trapezoid. A trapezoid is defined as a quadrilateral with two parallel sides and two non-parallel sides. The shaded region is a trapezoid.\n[3] The trapezoid is a plane figure which has surface Area, but no volume but if there was a 3d figure your equation would be.The Surface Area of a trapezoid = \u00bd(b1+b2) x h X Height of figure.\n[4] First you find the area of trapezoid h(a+b)/2 h is the height of the trapezo \u2026 id, not the height of the prisma is the length of the topb is the length of the bottom Then you find the volume of the trapezoidal prism with this formula H*h(a+b)/2 H is the height of the prism.Multiply H by the area of the trapezoid that you found in step one.\n[5] Find the total surface area of an isosceles trapezoidal prism with parallel edges of the base 6 cm and 12 cm, the legs of the base 5 cm each, the altitude of the base 4 cm and height of the prism 10 cm. The perimeter of the base is the sum of the lengths of the sides. p = 6 + 5 + 12 + 5 = 28 cm.\n[6] = 1 / 2 \u00d7 (sum of parallel sides) \u00d7 (distance between them). Formula of Area of a trapezium = 1/2 \u00d7 (sum of parallel sides) \u00d7 (distance between them). 1. Two parallel sides of a trapezium are of lengths 27 cm and 19 cm respectively, and the distance between them is 14 cm.Find the area of the trapezium.. The area of a trapezium is 352 cm2 and the distance between its parallel sides is16 cm. If one of the parallel sides is of length 25 cm, find the length of the other. Solution: Let the length of the required side be x cm.\n[7] To find the area of a trapezoid... The longer base (the bottom) is big B and the smaller base (the top) is little b... Yeah, that's the formula... But let's check out where it comes from! Take two copies of the trapezoid (one blue trapezoid and one green trapezoid)...\n[8] \u2022 The area of a parallelogram is twice the area of a triangle created by any of its diagonals. \u2022 The area of the parallelogram is divided in half by any line passing through the midpoint. Trapezoid (or Trapezium in British English) is a convex quadrilateral where at least two sides are parallel and unequal in length. The parallel sides of the trapezoid are known as the bases and the other two sides are called the legs.\n[9] In geometry, there is an important theorem - triangle mid segment theorem. Midsegment theorem tells us about the relation between the midsegments and the sides of the triangle. Midsegment of a triangle is the line segment that joins the midpoints of any two sides. A triangle can have three midsegments at the most.\n[10] You can calculate the area when you know the median, it is just the median times the height: Area = mh. Trapezium. A trapezium (UK: trapezoid) is a quadrilateral with NO parallel sides. The US and UK have their definitions swapped over, like this:\n[11] Every trapezoid has two legs. Altitude: The altitude of a trapezoid is the perpendicular distance from one base to the other. (One base may need to be extended). Median: The median of a trapezoid is a line joining the midpoints of the two legs. See Trapezoid median: Area: The usual way to calculate the area is the average base length times altitude. See Area of a Trapezoid: Perimeter\n[12] A trapezoid is a quadrilateral with at least two sides that run parallel to each other. Its corners can have any angles. Each of the four sides on a trapezoid can be a different length. There are two different ways you can find the area of a trapezoid, depending on which pieces of information you have.\n[13] Quick Answer. A trapezoid has four sides and four vertices. A vertex is a corner of a polygon. According to Reference.com, a trapezoid is a quadrilateral plane figure that has two parallel sides and two non-parallel sides. All four-sided figures have four corners, or vertices. The perimeter of a trapezoid is determined the same way as that of a square or rectangle: the length of all four sides are added together. The area, however, is not determined the same way. For squares and rectangles, the area is determined by the formula area equals length times width.\n[14] A trapezoid is a two-dimensional shape, so it doesn't have surface area. The AREA of a trapezoid is: (Base1+Base2) X Height Divided/Over 2.\n[15] Let $ABCD$ be the trapezoid with $ AB || CD, |AB|=30, |BC|=16, |CD|=40, |DA|=14$. Draw the altitude from $A$ which intersects line $CD$ at $X$, so the altitude of the trapezoid is $h=|AX|$. Draw the line parallel to $BC$ theough $A$ which intersects $CD$ at $Y$.\n[16] 2. The area of a trapezium is 352 cm2 and the distance between its parallel sides is16 cm. If one of the parallel sides is of length 25 cm, find the length of the other. Solution: Let the length of the required side be x cm.. The area of a trapezium is 352 cm2 and the distance between its parallel sides is16 cm. If one of the parallel sides is of length 25 cm, find the length of the other. Solution: Let the length of the required side be x cm.\n[17] Since, this area is equal to the area of the trapezoid we have the following relation: (1/2)(a^2 + 2ab + b^2) = (1/2)(2ab + c^2). Multiplying both sides by 2 and subtracting 2ab from both sides we get. This concludes another proof for Pythagorean Theorem.\n[18] First and fore most a Trapezoid is a quadrilateral which is a 4 sided plane shape. 1 It has 4 lines. 2 It is a closed shape. 3 Two of the lines are parallel. It is a simple quadrilateral - meaning the sum of it's angles is 360 1 degrees. A Trapezoid is a Trapezoid and cannot be named anything else.\n[19] You can find the perimeter of the trapezoid if you are missing the base measurement but have the measurements of the other three sides and the two inner base angles. You will need to visually split the trapezoid into three parts: a rectangle at the center and two triangles at either end.\n[20] The perimeter of a trapezoid is simply the sum of all four sides. Since they have no relationship to each other, there is no formula for it. Simply find the four side lengths and add them up.\nSearch Query: how to find the midsegment of a trapezoid.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

The average of the bases is straight forward: In order to find the height, you must draw an altitude. This creates a right triangle in which one of the legs is also the height of the trapezoid.here is the length of the side opposite the. Beginning with the side, if we were to create a triangle, the length of the base is, and the height is. Creating another triangle on the left, we find the height is, the length of the base is, and the side is.

You can find the area of a trapezoid using the lengths of these two sides, and the distance between the two sides, called the height.If you don't know a trapezoid's height, solve for it using the Pythagorean Theorem and length of the trapezoid's diagonals, the two sides that connect its bases.rea, A, is given by the lengths of the two bases, b1 and b2, divided by 2 and multiplied by the trapezoid's height, h, as follows: A = (b1 + b2) / 2 x h.

And a well deserved one: a quarter pounder with cheese at McDonald's has 12 grams, while a Whopper sandwich with cheese at Burger King has 16 (almost enough for a whole day's worth in a single meal -- before the fries).\n[19] There are 580 calories in a 1 sandwich serving of Wendy's Double Cheeseburger (No Bun).

USER: I will provide you with 20 passages, each indicated by a numerical identifier []. Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: difference between a mcdouble and a double cheeseburger.\n\n[1] At first glance, the double cheeseburger looks a lot like the McDouble, but it is not exactly the same thing. The main difference that you will notice is the amount of cheese that is on this sandwich. There are two slices of cheese on the double cheeseburger instead of just the one slice of cheese that comes on the McDouble. Even though it comes with two slices of cheese, it still has the onions, pickles, ketchup and mustard that come on the other burgers.\n[2] The McDouble is listed as a slice of American cheese between two 100% beef patties, topped with pickles, onions, ketchup and mustard. mcdonalds.com. The Double Cheeseburger is listed as two slices of golden American cheese with two 100% all beef patties, pickles, onions, ketchup and mustard.\n[3] A double cheesburger has 2 slices of cheese with 2 meat patties. A mcdouble on the other hand only had 1 slice of cheese, but still 2 pieces of meat. I say had because mcdoubles arent sold in Australia (maybe a few stores but not a regular menu item) anymore. Other countries might be different but that's the difference in Australia.\n[4] There is a discernible difference between the two burgers, especially in the meat quality. The McDouble contains gristle and carry's a different flavor than the Double Cheeseburger. The double cheeseburger tastes more like beef. The McDouble tastes of whatever meat filler they use to fill the gap.\n[5] But I did it for you. With McDonald's recent release of the McDouble, they now have three basic, sub-$2 cheeseburgers: the cheeseburger, McDouble (two patties with one slice of cheese), and double cheeseburger (two patties with two slices of cheese).\n[6] Review: Triple Cheeseburger from McDonald's. When it comes to the various sizes of classic McDonald's cheeseburgers, the prices might have you scratching your head. The price differences between a McDonald's Cheeseburger, the beefier McDouble and the cheesier Double Cheeseburger now all fall within 50-cents of one another.\n[7] Although we previously reported that the McDouble would be on the Dollar Menu, in Manhattan the cheeseburger appears on the Dollar Menu while the McDouble is $1.39 and the double cheeseburger is $1.49.\n[8] So whenever the McDouble hit the Dollar Menu and the Double Cheeseburger was thrown into the \"Burgers\" section at $1.19 or even higher ($1.29 in most places now), the average consumer scratched their head, winced their eyes, and fell over in a wrath of confusion and bewilderment.\n[9] The Double Cheesburger is now $1.19 instead of a buck. Seriously, $.19/slice of cheese and a removal from the Dollar Menu. Do I order the Double Cheeseburger at its new full price or do I stick to the Dollar Menu and go with the McDouble. Of course, I go with the McDouble. One piece of McCheese might be better than two pieces of McCheese. I guess McDonalds thinks people like me who bought the Double Cheeseburger for a buck will pony up and pay the extra pennies. Sooner or later they will be charging for extra napkins and ketchup.\n[10] The difference is that the Mighty Kid's Meal provides more food than what is typically found in a Happy Meal, providing a McDouble (a cheeseburger consisting of two patties and one slice of cheese) instead of a cheeseburger or a hamburger, and more Chicken McNuggets (6 versus 4), plus a larger drink (16oz vs 12oz).\n[11] There are many items that can be purchased at McDonald's for just $1, really, just check their dollar menu ! Here's a tip that not everyone knows... a McDouble from the McDonalds Dollar menu is the same thing as a Double Cheeseburger-well, minus one piece of cheese (and a lot of cents).\n[12] There are 440 calories in a 1 cheeseburger serving of McDonald's Double Cheeseburger. Calorie breakdown: 45% fat, 32% carbs, 23% protein.\n[13] The menu item maintains 440 calories, 25 grams of protein, 22 grams of fat, and 1,050mg of sodium. Similarly, the McDouble, featuring two patties and one slice of cheese, consists of 390 calories, 18 grams of fat, and 850mg of sodium.\n[14] There are 280 calories in a 1 burger serving of McDonald's Double Cheeseburger (No Bun). Calorie breakdown: 67% fat, 4% carbs, 28% protein.\n[15] Cheeseburgers. A single-patty cheeseburger contains 5.25 grams of saturated fat, and a double-patty cheeseburger has 10.55 grams. A cheeseburger made with three patties of ground beef contains about 20 grams of saturated fat. Fast food cheeseburgers can contribute upwards of 30 grams of unhealthy saturated fats, depending on how much beef and how many slices of cheese you get with your order.\n[16] Cheeseburgers, for instance, have a bad reputation when it comes to saturated fats. And a well deserved one: a quarter pounder with cheese at McDonald's has 12 grams, while a Whopper sandwich with cheese at Burger King has 16 (almost enough for a whole day's worth in a single meal -- before the fries).\n[17] The Double Cheeseburger is priced at $1.49 and my Triple Cheeseburger was priced at $2.19. I just don't understand the point of paying 70-cents for an extra burger patty when you can just get two McDoubles for $2.00. Obviously the value of the Triple Cheeseburger makes no sense when you're comparing menu items.\n[18] Review: McDonald's - Daily Double. 1 McDonald's Daily Double is a new Extra Value Menu item and McDouble variant featuring two beef patties, a slice of American cheese, slivered onions, a thick slice of tomato, shredded lettuce, and mayo on a plain toasted hamburger bun. It's not nearly a value as the McDouble as it carries a price tag of $1.99.\n[19] It also comes in sandwich form with mayo for the same price. On the burger front, McDo has the Cheeseburger Deluxe (the Mac!) which is a cheeseburger with lettuce, cheese, and mayo at a relatively pricey (in comparison) 52 pesos ($1.17). You can also get the Double Cheeseburger Deluxe for 87 pesos ($1.96!)\n[20] There are these cheap a s s double cheeseburgers for only $1 at McDonalds. The wrapper says 25 grams of protein. Seems like a huge amount of protein for 2 shriveled up McDonalds burgers with bread and cheese.\nSearch Query: difference between a mcdouble and a double cheeseburger.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

There are several different types of cerebral palsy, including spastic, dyskinetic, ataxic, hypotonic, and mixed.\n[2] This is very different from aphasia and dysphasia, an impaired understanding or problems in expressing words, caused by a problem in the language centres of the brain. People with dysarthria usually slur their speech and sound as though they are drunk, but they may also speak very slowly, or sound hoarse, or nasal.\n[3] Dysarthria is a disorder of speech whilst dysphasia is a disorder of language. 1 Speech is the process of articulation and pronunciation. It involves the bulbar muscles and the physical ability to form words. 2 Language is the process in which thoughts and ideas become spoken.\n[4] Dysarthria in children is usually developmental, while dysarthria in adults is often acquired, although both types can affect people of any age. Whether dysarthria will improve with speech and language therapy depends on the cause and the extent of the brain damage or dysfunction.\n[5] Impairment of speech; Slurred speech; Speech disorders \u2013 dysarthria. Causes, incidence, and risk factors. In a person with dysarthria, a nerve, brain, or muscle disorder makes it difficult to use or control the muscles of the mouth, tongue, larynx, or vocal cords, which make speech.\n[6] Dysarthria is a disorder of speech whilst dysphasia is a disorder of language. Speech is the process of articulation and pronunciation. It involves the bulbar muscles and the physical ability to form words. Language is the process in which thoughts and ideas become spoken.\n[7] Cerebral Palsy has three main types that are classified by the type of permanent disability caused by the permanent brain damage suffered during labor, delivery, shortly after birth.or more information about spastic cerebral palsy, Click Here. Athetoid Cerebral Palsy. Children with athetoid cerebral palsy suffer an ever changing level of muscle tone. As a result, children with athetoid cerebral palsy suffer a constant succession of slow, writhing, involuntary movements.\n[8] Spastic quadriplegia. This is the most serious kind of spastic cerebral palsy. It affects most of the body, including all arms and legs, the torso (the body's midsection) and the face. These children usually can't walk and they often have intellectual disabilities, trouble speaking and seizures.\n[9] Pachygyria (from the Greek pachy meaning thick or fat gyri) is a congenital malformation of the cerebral hemisphere.It results in unusually thick convolutions of the cerebral cortex.ne of the best known and most common types of neuronal migration disorders is lissencephaly, a diffuse cortical malformation relating directly to agyria and pachygyria. Incomplete neuronal migration during the early fetal brain development is the precursor to lissencephaly.\n[10] Dysarthria In dysarthria, errors are consistent and predictable. There are no islands of clear speech; no matter what the speaking task or materials used, the patient will exhibit the same amount and types of errors. Errors are mainly distortions and omissions. Distortions are the most common type of error in dysarthria. Apraxia In apraxia, errors are inconsistent and unpredictable. Different error patterns occur in spontaneous speech versus repetition. Patients' spontaneous speech contains fewer errors than does his/her speech in repetition tasks.\n[11] The three types of CP are: 1 spastic cerebral palsy \u2014 causes stiffness and movement difficulties. 2 athetoid cerebral palsy \u2014 leads to involuntary and uncontrolled movements. ataxic cerebral palsy \u2014 causes a problem with balance and depth perception.\n[12] Damage to any of these parts of the brain may cause cerebral palsy. 1 Spastic \u2013 Spastic cerebral palsy is caused by damage to the motor cortex. 2 This causes exaggerated, jerky movements.3 Athetoid/dyskinetic \u2013 Athetoid CP is caused by damage to the cerebellum and/or the basal ganglia.amage to different parts of the brain's motor control centers causes different types of cerebral palsy. The level of disability depends on the severity and timing of the brain injury. 1 About 70 percent of cerebral palsy cases are caused by prenatal injuries. 2 About 20 percent are caused by injuries during birth.\n[13] Spastic (pyramidal) cerebral palsy. Spastic cerebral palsy is the most common type. A person with spastic CP develops tight muscles in some parts of the body that are unable to relax. Affected joints become stiff and hard to move.Usually, a person has problems controlling movements, poor coordination and balance, and difficulty talking and eating. These are the most common types of spastic cerebral palsy. 2 Monoplegia: Only one arm or leg is affected. 3 Quadriplegia: Both arms and both legs are affected. 4 Usually the trunk and muscles that control the mouth, tongue, and windpipe are affected too. 5 This makes eating and talking difficult.\n[14] 1 Spastic quadriplegia/quadriparesis is the most severe form of cerebral palsy and is often associated with moderate-to-severe intellectual disability. 2 It is caused by widespread damage to the brain or significant brain malformations.pastic cerebral palsy is the most common type of the disorder. People have stiff muscles and awkward movements. Forms of spastic cerebral palsy include: 1 Spastic hemiplegia/hemiparesis typically affects the arm and hand on one side of the body, but it can also include the leg.\n[15] As the most common form of cerebral palsy, congenital cerebral palsy is an incurable form of brain damage that results in mildly to severely impaired cognition, speech, coordination and general movement. In the most severe cases, cerebral palsy patients also suffer from epilepsy, mental retardation and paraplegia or quadriplegia.\n[16] All people with cerebral palsy have problems with movement and posture, and some also have some level of intellectual disability, seizures, and abnormal physical sensations or perceptions, as well as other medical disorders.

Spastic cerebral palsy is the most common type. A person with spastic CP develops tight muscles in some parts of the body that are unable to relax. Affected joints become stiff and hard to move.Usually, a person has problems controlling movements, poor coordination and balance, and difficulty talking and eating. These are the most common types of spastic cerebral palsy. 2 Monoplegia: Only one arm or leg is affected. 3 Quadriplegia: Both arms and both legs are affected. 4 Usually the trunk and muscles that control the mouth, tongue, and windpipe are affected too. 5 This makes eating and talking difficult.\n[17] 1 Hemiplegia or diplegia: One arm and one leg on the same side of the body (hemiplegia) or both legs (diplegia or paraplegia) are affected. 2 These are the most common types of spastic cerebral palsy. 3 Monoplegia: Only one arm or leg is affected. These are the most common types of spastic cerebral palsy. 2 Monoplegia: Only one arm or leg is affected. 3 Quadriplegia: Both arms and both legs are affected. 4 Usually the trunk and muscles that control the mouth, tongue, and windpipe are affected too. 5 This makes eating and talking difficult.\n[18] As the most common form of cerebral palsy, congenital cerebral palsy is an incurable form of brain damage that results in mildly to severely impaired cognition, speech, coordination and general movement. In the most severe cases, cerebral palsy patients also suffer from epilepsy, mental retardation and paraplegia or quadriplegia.\n[19] Types of Cerebral Palsy. Cerebral palsy can be described by the way it affects people's movement, the part of the body affected and by how severe the affects are. Quadriplegia (a form of bilateral cerebral palsy) Both arms and legs are affected. The muscles of the trunk, face and mouth are often also affected.\n[20] 1 Spastic quadriplegia/quadriparesis is the most severe form of cerebral palsy and is often associated with moderate-to-severe intellectual disability. 2 It is caused by widespread damage to the brain or significant brain malformations.pastic cerebral palsy is the most common type of the disorder.

It results from impaired movement of the muscles used for speech production, including the lips, tongue, vocal folds, and/or diaphragm. The type and severity of dysarthria depend on which area of the nervous system is affected.\n[2] Secondary conditions can include seizures, epilepsy, apraxia, dysarthria or other communication disorders, eating problems, sensory impairments, mental retardation, learning disabilities, and/or behavioral disorders. Speech and language disorders are common in people with Cerebral Palsy.\n[3] [edit on Wikidata] Dysarthria is a motor speech disorder resulting from neurological injury of the motor component of the motor-speech system and is characterized by poor articulation of phonemes (cf. aphasia: a disorder of the content of language).\n[4] Dyskinetic Athetoid Cerebral Palsy. Dyskinetic Cerebral Palsy, also known as athetoid cerebral palsy or ADCP, is a form of cerebral palsy marked by involuntary movement. It's not as common as spastic cerebral palsy but it's not as rare as ataxic cerebral palsy. Dyskinetic/Athetoid cerebral palsy is caused by damage to the brain's basal ganglia. The basal ganglia is responsible for submitting messages to the body to help coordinate and control movements. When it's damaged, voluntary movements are compromised, resulting in spasticity and other abnormal movements.\n[5] Anarthria is the most severe form of dysarthria, resulting in the loss of clear, articulate speech. Dysarthria is a speech deficit caused by problems controlling the muscles involved in speech production. Anarthria and dysarthria are not caused by problems with language comprehension or with problems thinking or finding the right words.\n[6] The types of cerebral palsy are: 1 spastic: the most common type of cerebral palsy; reflexes are exaggerated and muscle movement is stiff. 2 dyskinetic: dyskinetic cerebral palsy is divided into two categories.\n[7] Home / Cerebral Palsy / Types of Cerebral Palsy / Periventricular Leukomalacia (PVL) Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) is a form of brain damage that affects the white matter of brain, resulting in the cells in the white matter of brain either decaying or dying.

Dyskinetic cerebral palsy can be divided into two different groups; choreoathetoid and dystonic. Choreo-athetotic CP is characterized by involuntary movements most predominantly found in the face and extremities.\n[3] Adults and children with certain chronic brain disorders often exhibit symptoms of dyskinesia. Movement can occur in the head, arms, legs, hand, feet, lips, or tongue. The dyskinesias can be categorized as chorea , dystonia , myoclonus , tremor, and paroxysmal tardive (late-onset type). Other forms of dyskinesia include athetosis, ballism, akathisia, tics, stereotypy, and restless legs.

These disorders result from central or peripheral nervous system damage and are manifested as weakness, slowness, or incoordination of speech.\n[6] Ataxic dysarthria results from cerebellar lesions. Such damage could be caused by stroke, trauma or by neurological disorders like muscular sclerosis. The cerebellum plays an important role in the coordination of motor movement due to its integration of sensory and motor information.yperkinetic Dysarthria. Hyperkinetic dysarthria results from damage to the extrapyramidal tract. It specifically results from lesions of the basal ganglia. The extrapyramidal system is involved in automatic motor movements and works with the autonomic nervous system to control posture and muscle tone.\n[7] The list below shows some of the causes of Dysarthria mentioned in various sources: 1 Aceruloplasminemia - dysarthria. 2 Acquired brain injury. 3 Alcoholic cerebellar degeneration. 4 Alopecia -- hypogonadism -- extrapyramidal disorder - dysarthria. 5 Amyloidosis, oculoleptomeningeal - dysarthria. 6 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\n[8] Dysarthria does not include speech disorders from structural abnormalities, such as cleft palate, and must not be confused with apraxia of speech, which refers to problems in the planning and programming aspect of the motor-speech system.\n[9] Dysarthria is a motor speech disorder resulting from neurological injury of the motor component of the motor-speech system and is characterized by poor articulation of phonemes (cf. aphasia: a disorder of the content of language).\n[10] Infarcts of interior carotid artery and middle and posterior cerebral arteries can cause spastic dysarthria \u2013 but must have bilateral lesions because these arteries are far apart; a single brainstem stroke can cause spastic dysarthria, but a single cerebral hemisphere stroke usually cannot.

Speech impairments in spastic dysarthria involves four major abnormalities of voluntary movement: spasticity, weakness, limited range of motion and slowness of movement.\n[2] Dysarthria is a feature of many neurological diseases including cerebral palsy, stroke, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson s disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis. Dysarthria is a relatively common symptom of multiple sclerosis and can take many forms.Episodic paroxysmal dysarthria, which is where the dysarthria lasts for up to a minute or so and recurs several times a day, is particulary common in MS.ysarthria refers to speech problems that are caused by the muscles involved with speaking or the nerves controlling them. Both muscle weakness and incoordination can give rise to dysarthria. Speech problems that result from cognitive dysfunction are not dysarthria.\n[3] Dysarthria is caused by damage to the brain. This may occur at birth, as in cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy, or may occur later in life due to one of many different conditions that involve the nervous system, including. 1 stroke,\n[4] Dysarthria is a motor speech disorder.

There are likely to be other possible causes, so ask your doctor about your symptoms. Cerebral stroke (see Stroke symptoms) Painful oral ulcers. Brainstem infarct (see Stroke symptoms) Cerebellar infarct (see Brain symptoms) Multiple sclerosis.\n[7] In dysarthria, you may have difficulty moving the muscles in your mouth, face or upper respiratory system that control speech.

He retired in 2008 as School Professor of European Thought at the London School of Economics and Political Science.\n[10] Grey started exploring African drumming and devoted his time to organic agriculture, running a small farm in The Midlands, England. He rejoined Wire in 2000, dropping his Robert Gotobed alias and using his birthname Robert Grey.\n[11] I'm not a politician, said Gray in a Wednesday interview. I'm not a person who really wanted to run for Governor.. Robert Gray is 46-year-old truck driver. That schedule prevented him from campaigning, aside from a couple of small events. He also didn't fundraise at all. So with no money in the campaign bank, a man who admits he usually shies away from attention, clinched the nomination.

He discovered a great river and named it after his boat The Columbia. His discovery was the basis of America's claim to the Oregon Territory.\n[16] Gray was a 25-year-old African-American man who lived in the Gilmor Homes neighborhood of Baltimore. Gray was taken into police custody on April 12 and, according to video and eyewitness accounts, pinned down and dragged to a police van.\n[17] Gray's second place showing in the race to lay claim to the invention of the telephone did not tarnish his professional reputation however.

Public key cryptography (PKC) is an encryption technique that uses a paired public and private key (or asymmetric key) algorithm for secure data communication. A message sender uses a recipient's public key to encrypt a message. To decrypt the sender's message, only the recipient's private key may be used. The two types of PKC algorithms are RSA, which is an acronym related to this algorithm's inventors: Rivest, Shamir and Adelman and Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA).\n[2] The Key interface is the top-level interface for all keys. 1 It defines the functionality shared by all key objects. All keys have three characteristics: 2 An Algorithm This is the key algorithm for that key. The key algorithm is usually an encryption or asymmetric operation algorithm (such as DSA or RSA), which will work with those algorithms and with related algorithms (such as MD5 with RSA, SHA-1 with RSA, Raw DSA, etc.) The name of the algorithm of a key is obtained using the getAlgorithm method.

A technical momentum indicator that compares the magnitude of recent gains to recent losses in an attempt to determine overbought and oversold conditions of an asset. It is calculated using the following formula: RSI = 100 - 100/(1 + RS*).\n[7] 1 Usually RSA is used to share a secret key and then a symmetric key algorithm is used for the actual encryption. 2 RSA can be used for digital signing but is slower. 3 DSA (see below) is preferred. 4 However, RSA signatures are faster to verify.\n[8] RSA SecurID, formerly referred to as SecurID, is a mechanism developed by Security Dynamics (later RSA Security and now RSA, The Security Division of EMC) for performing two-factor authentication for a user to a network resource.s of 2003, RSA SecurID commanded over 70% of the two-factor authentication market and 25 million devices have been produced to date. A number of competitors, such as VASCO, make similar security tokens, mostly based on the open OATH HOTP standard.\n[9] In the stock market and other financial markets, RSI refers to the relative strength index, an important technical indicator in trading stocks, bonds, commodities, futures, options and currencies. It tells you approximately how much your security is overbought or oversold in the market.\n[10] RSA Algorithm.

Public host keys are stored on and/or distributed to SSH clients, and private keys are stored on SSH servers. Host Keys Should Be Unique.\n[20] Unlike their corresponding public keys, private keys must be protected. Therefore, all files in the RSA folder are automatically encrypted with a random, symmetric key called the user's master key.

It also happens to be one of the methods used in our PGP and GPG programs. Unlike Triple DES, RSA is considered an asymmetric algorithm due to its use of a pair of keys.\n[6] Rivest, Shamir, and Adelman (RSA) is a public-key cryptographic system used for authentication. IKE on the Cisco router or PIX Firewall uses a D-H exchange to determine secret keys on each IPSec peer used by encryption algorithms. The D-H exchange can be authenticated with RSA signatures or preshared keys.\n[7] Definition - What does RSA Encryption mean? RSA encryption is a public-key encryption technology developed by RSA Data Security. The RSA algorithm is based on the difficulty in factoring very large numbers. Based on this principle, the RSA encryption algorithm uses prime factorization as the trap door for encryption. Deducing an RSA key, therefore, takes a huge amount of time and processing power. RSA is the standard encryption method for important data, especially data that's transmitted over the Internet.\n[8] RSA scrambles data based on the product of two prime numbers, each of which is 100 digits long. RSA is known as a public key encryption system, meaning that many people can use it to encode information, but only the person who holds the key (or knows the value of the two prime numbers) can decode it again.\n[9] THE CRYPTOGRAPHY GUIDE: RSA. RSA RSA is a public key algorithm invented by Rivest, Shamir and Adleman. The key used for encryption is different from (but related to) the key used for decryption.The algorithm is based on modular exponentiation.hen talking of key lengths in connection with RSA, what is meant is the modulus length. An algorithm that uses different keys for encryption and decryption is said to be asymmetric.

Public key cryptography (PKC) is an encryption technique that uses a paired public and private key (or asymmetric key) algorithm for secure data communication. A message sender uses a recipient's public key to encrypt a message. To decrypt the sender's message, only the recipient's private key may be used. The two types of PKC algorithms are RSA, which is an acronym related to this algorithm's inventors: Rivest, Shamir and Adelman and Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA).\n[15] RSA involves a public key and a private key. The public key can be known by everyone and is used for encrypting messages. Messages encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted in a reasonable amount of time using the private key.n such a cryptosystem, the encryption key is public and differs from the decryption key which is kept secret. In RSA, this asymmetry is based on the practical difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers, the factoring problem.\n[16] Techopedia explains RSA Encryption. RSA encryption is a public key encryption technology developed by RSA Data Security, which licenses the algorithm technologies and also sells the development kits. RSA is built into many common software products, including Microsoft's Internet Explorer.\n[17] RSA makes the public key infrastructure (PKI) encryption standards by which much of the Internet's secure communication are run. Other RSA products include hardware token s, software tokens, SecurID, Besafe and enVision. RSA encryption is based on use of a public and a private key. Typically a key fob (such as an RSA SecurID security token) is used by employees in security-sensitive companies. The token generates a public key that changes every minute.\n[18] PEM encoded RSA private key. PEM encoded RSA private key is a format that stores an RSA private key, for use with cryptographic systems such as SSL. A public key can be derived from the private key, and the public key may be associated with one or more certificate files.\n[19] When Alice receives Bob's message she decrypts it by using her RSA private key (d, n) as follows: C d mod n = 48 103 mod 143 = 9 = M.

Mechanical ventilation, in the healthcare setting or home, helps patients breathe by assisting the inhalation of oxygen into the lungs and the exhalation of carbon dioxide. Depending on the patient's condition, mechanical ventilation can help support or completely control breathing.\n[3] Mechanical ventilation is the use of a mechanical device (machine) to inflate and deflate the lungs. Mechanical ventilation provides the force needed to deliver air to the lungs in a patient whose own ventilatory abilities are diminished or lost. Breathing requires the movement of air into and out of the lungs. This is normally accomplished by the diaphragm and chest muscles. A variety of medical conditions can impair the ability of these muscles to accomplish this task, including: muscular dystrophies.\n[4] What Is Mechanical Ventilation?

It is also indicated as prophylaxis for imminent collapse of other physiologic functions, or ineffective gas exchange in the lungs.\n[6] Mechanical ventilation is among the most common interventions in the intensive care unit (ICU). Over the last two decades, numerous studies have investigated methods to improve outcomes of patients receiving mechanical ventilation.\n[7] Mechanical ventilation may be defined as the use of a mechanical device to provide. ventilator support for patients. There are 2 types of mechanical ventilation: positive and. negative pressure ventilation. Positive pressure ventilation delivers a positive pressure to. inflate the lungs. Expiration is passive.\n[8] Summary Mechanical ventilation, applied either invasively through a tracheotomy tube or noninvasively via a mask, is increasingly used for long-term management of many forms of severe chronic respiratory failure in the home setting.\n[9] Mechanical Ventilation is an integral part of HVAC.

Depending on the patient's condition, mechanical ventilation can help support or completely control breathing.\n[11] Ventilators are medical devices that provide mechanical ventilation to assist with or replace patients' spontaneous breathing. Mechanical ventilation is often categorized based on the interface used, such as a tracheostomy tube for invasive ventilation, or a mask for non-invasive ventilation.\n[12] There are other ways to estimate home ventilator prevalence in the United States. Medicare claims data from 2010 indicates approximately 3,172 patients on home mechanical ventilation using an invasive interface, and 899 patients on home mechanical ventilation with a noninvasive interface.n some countries, if the patient requires ventilator support more than X hours per day, he is placed on a life-support ventilator. There seems to be no consensus on the number of hours per day that constitutes \"life-support ventilation.\" Some countries use 12 hours, some 14 hours, some more.\n[13] Mechanical Ventilation. Mechanical ventilation is a method of forced or induced ventilation by using mechanical air handling systems, commonly called HVAC systems. Mechanical ventilation is more controllable than natural ventilation. In Mechanical Ventilation blowers, fans, filters, and ducts are used for transporting and removing air from a space.There are two types of fans used for the transmission of air. When the air enters the impellers axially and is discharged radially from the impeller, it is called a centrifugal or radial flow fan.t is the movement of air from one space to other as well as supply of fresh air into the air conditioned space. Mechanical ventilation assists in controlling the humidity, contaminants, air borne particles, and general air quality.\n[14] Mechanical ventilation is also called forced or induced ventilation and is done by fans and other mechanical means.

Mechanical ventilation assists in controlling the humidity, contaminants, air borne particles, and general air quality.\n[15] Numerous decisions need to be made once it is determined that a patient requires mechanical ventilation, including the mode of mechanical ventilation. The mode refers to the method of inspiratory support. Its selection is generally based on clinician familiarity and institutional preferences since there is a paucity of evidence indicating that the mode affects clinical outcome. Common modes of mechanical ventilation are described in this topic review (table 1).\n[16] Mechanical ventilation is indicated when the patient's spontaneous ventilation is inadequate to sustain life. In addition, it is indicated as a measure to control ventilation in critically ill patients and as prophylaxis for impending collapse of other physiologic functions. second possible advantage of this mode of mechanical ventilation is that cycling the ventilator into the inspiratory phase maintains normal ventilatory activity and, therefore, prevents atrophy of the respiratory muscles.\n[17] Mechanical ventilation can decrease the patient's work of breathing by unloading respiratory muscles in a synchronous manner. Mechanical ventilation can also maintain long-term respiratory support of patients with chronic ventilatory problems.\n[18] Nasotracheal intubation In medicine, mechanical ventilation is a method to mechanically assist or replace spontaneous breathing. Mechanical ventilation is typically used after an invasive intubation, a procedure wherein an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube is inserted into the airway.\n[19] Mechanical ventilation can be noninvasive, involving various types of face masks, or invasive, involving endotracheal intubation (see Tracheal Intubation). Selection and use of appropriate techniques require an understanding of respiratory mechanics.\n[20] Mechanical ventilation can be noninvasive, involving various types of face masks, or invasive, involving endotracheal intubation (see Airway Establishment and Control : Endotracheal tubes).

Examples: Hydrochloric acid (HCl) and nitric acid (HNO 3) are both monoprotic acids.\n[11] The marginal cost function is: MC = 10 + 2Q. The marginal revenue is: MR = 25 - 2Q. The monopolist's profit is found by subtracting total cost from its total revenue. In terms of calculus, the profit is maximized by taking the derivative of this function, \u03c0 = TR - TC, and equating it to zero. Therefore, the quantity supplied that maximizes the monopolist's profit is found by equating MC to MR: 10 + 2Q = 30 - 2Q. The quantity it must produce to satisfy the equality above is five.\n[12] Monosynaptic means there is only one neuron involved each way on the path to the spinal cord (called an afferent or sensory neuron) and one away from the spinal cord (called an efferent or motor neuron).

A monomial is a product of positive integer powers of a fixed set of variables (possibly) together with a coefficient, e.g., , , or . A monomial can also be thought of as a nonzero summand of a polynomial (Becker and Weispfenning 1993, p. 191; Cox et al. 1996). A monomial with the coefficient excluded is usually called a term. Unfortunately, in some older works, the definitions of monomial and term are sometimes reversed.\n[16] A hypertonic solution is one with a high concentration of solutes when compared to another solution which is separated from it by a semipermeable membrane.

Hypertonic is when the tonicity of the cell is lower than that of the surrounding liquid, isotonic is when the tonicity\u2026 of the cell is equal to that of the surrounding liquid, and hypotonic is when the tonicity of the cell is greater than that of the surrounding liquid.\n[2] This type of solution is infused to replace fluid losses, usually extracellular losses, and to expand the intravascular volume. Most isotonic solutions do not provide calories or free water. Examples of isotonic solutions are 0.9% sodium chloride, commonly called normal saline (NS), and lactated Ringer's (LR).\n[3] These are sometimes called balanced colors. An example of a triadic scheme could be red, blue, and yellow; green, orange, and purple, etc. A double split complement (also called tetradic) uses two pairs of complements, one apart on the color wheel. An example is red, green, orange, and blue.\n[4] A solution which has the same concentration as present in the blood or cells of body is an Isotonic solution. Such cells neither absorb water nor lose any water molecule. Saline solution is a common example of isotonic solution.\n[5] In computer science, and in particular functional programming, a hylomorphism is a recursive function, corresponding to the composition of an anamorphism followed by a catamorphism. Fusion of these two recursive computations into a single recursive pattern then avoids building the intermediate data structure. This is an example of deforestation, a program optimization strategy. A related type of function is a metamorphism, which is a catamorphism followed by an anamorphism.\n[6] In the examples above, Solutions A and B are isotonic (with each other), Solutions A and B are both hypertonic compared to Solution C, and Solution C is hypotonic relative to Solutions A and B. Diffusion of water across a membrane generates a pressure called osmotic pressure. If the pressure in the compartment into which water is flowing is raised to the equivalent of the osmotic pressure, movement of water will stop.\n[7] Historical Examples. 1 All nose lotions should be alkaline, and isotonic with the blood plasma. 2 Normal saline solution is isotonic with the body cells and hence is employed as the vehicle. 3 Take, for instance, two isotonic solutions, one of salt and another of sugar. The Mechanism of Life Stphane Leduc It may be objected that segmentation is also produced by a solution which is isotonic with sea water.\n[8] In the examples above, Solutions A and B are isotonic (with each other), Solutions A and B are both hypertonic compared to Solution C, and Solution C is hypotonic relative to Solutions A and B.

Additional examples of how to determine which direction water will flow in different circumstances are provided.\n[9] A monotonic relationship is an important underlying assumption of the Spearman rank-order correlation. It is also important to recognize the assumption of a monotonic relationship is less restrictive than a linear relationship (an assumption that has to be met by the Pearson product-moment correlation).here are two methods to calculate Spearman's rank-order correlation depending on whether: (1) your data does not have tied ranks or (2) your data has tied ranks. The formula for when there are no tied ranks is: where d i = difference in paired ranks and n = number of cases.\n[10] Generally, all the free monosaccharides having free aldehyde or hydroxyl ketonic group are capable of being oxidised.

Example: 7, x, 7x, -6x, ab, etc. A monomial is a number, a variable, or the product of a number and one or more variables with whole number exponents. monomial is a single term which has no plus sign (+) or minus sign (-). Not a monomial: 8 + x, 2/n, 5 x, a-1, \u00d6x, -3x-3, x 2.5\n[4] A monomial is a product of positive integer powers of a fixed set of variables (possibly) together with a coefficient, e.g., x, 3xy^2, or -2x^2y^3z. A monomial can also be thought of as a nonzero summand of a polynomial (Becker and Weispfenning 1993, p. 191; Cox et al. 1996). A monomial with the coefficient excluded is usually called a term.\n[5] A function f (x) is concave over a convex set if and only if the function \u2212 f (x) is a convex function over the set. A differentiable function f is concave on an interval if its derivative function f \u2032 is monotonically decreasing on that interval: a concave function has a decreasing slope. Any affine function is both (non-strictly) concave and convex. 2 The sine function is concave on the interval. 3 The function, where is the determinant of a nonnegative-definite matrix B, is concave. 4 Practical example: rays bending in computation of radiowave attenuation in the atmosphere.\n[6] Isotonic solutions have an approximate electrolyte content of 300 mEq/L. This type of solution is infused to replace fluid losses, usually extracellular losses, and to expand the intravascular volume. Most isotonic solutions do not provide calories or free water. Examples of isotonic solutions are 0.9% sodium chloride, commonly called normal saline (NS), and lactated Ringer's (LR). Hypotonic solutions have an electrolyte content of less than 250 mEq/L and are administered to expand the intracellular space.\n[7] Cassandra also claims to offer monotonic read consistency, which means that if a client has seen any particular value for a key, it will never read an older value. Because system clocks are not monotonic, writes can't be monotonic either.\n[8] There are two types of semitones. They are chromatic and diatonic semitones. When a semitone contains two notes with the same letter name, it is chromatic. For examples, C to C# and D to D sharp are chromatic.When the two notes have different letter names, example, C to D flat and D to E flat, the semitone is diatonic. major scale is formed with the formula W-W-H-W-W-W-H. This stands for whole step, whole step, half step, whole step, whole step, whole step half step. As we've seen, the half steps are the semitones and the whole steps are the whole tones. There are 2 semitones and 5 whole steps.\n[9] An expression containing only one term is called a monomial. Example: 7, x, 7x, -6x, ab, etc. A monomial is a number, a variable, or the product of a number and one or more variables with whole number exponents. monomial is a single term which has no plus sign (+) or minus sign (-). Not a monomial: 8 + x, 2/n, 5 x, a-1, \u00d6x, -3x-3, x 2.5. Binomial: An expression containing two terms is called a binomial. Examples: 7x+5, 6y-p, etc. Trinomial: An expression containing three terms is called a trinomial. Examples: 2x+3y-4z, 1/2-m/3+4n, etc. Multinomial (or Polynomial): An expression containing more than three terms is called a multinomial or a polynomial.\n[10] Example Sentences for monotonous. The hero may, of course, sometimes die; but not always; that would be too monotonous. The monotonous cry of the leadsman in the chains was the only sound audible. The airs generally are plaintive and monotonous, and have a sad and weary sound. The scenery of this branch was as monotonous as that of the other.\n[11] piecewise_monotony := PIECEWISE (constant_piece_definition | functional_piece_definition) The pieces can be defined either by a set of constants or by another monotonic function, in which the pieces are defined by distinct values of the piece-defining function.\n[12] A monotonic relationship is an important underlying assumption of the Spearman rank-order correlation. It is also important to recognize the assumption of a monotonic relationship is less restrictive than a linear relationship (an assumption that has to be met by the Pearson product-moment correlation).here are two methods to calculate Spearman's rank-order correlation depending on whether: (1) your data does not have tied ranks or (2) your data has tied ranks. The formula for when there are no tied ranks is: where d i = difference in paired ranks and n = number of cases.\n[13] Given any sequence we have the following. 1 We call the sequence increasing if for every n. 2 We call the sequence decreasing if for every n. 3 If is an increasing sequence or is a decreasing sequence we call it monotonic. If there exists a number m such that for every n we say the sequence is bounded below.\n[14] A solution which has the same concentration as present in the blood or cells of body is an Isotonic solution. Such cells neither absorb water nor lose any water molecule. Saline solution is a common example of isotonic solution.\n[15] This type of solution is infused to replace fluid losses, usually extracellular losses, and to expand the intravascular volume. Most isotonic solutions do not provide calories or free water. Examples of isotonic solutions are 0.9% sodium chloride, commonly called normal saline (NS), and lactated Ringer's (LR).\n[16] In the examples above, Solutions A and B are isotonic (with each other), Solutions A and B are both hypertonic compared to Solution C, and Solution C is hypotonic relative to Solutions A and B. Diffusion of water across a membrane generates a pressure called osmotic pressure.sotonic: The solutions being compared have equal concentration of solutes. Hypertonic: The solution with the higher concentration of solutes. Hypotonic: The solution with the lower concentration of solutes. Additional examples of how to determine which direction water will flow in different circumstances are provided.\n[17] A hypertonic solution is one with a high concentration of solutes when compared to another solution which is separated from it by a semipermeable membrane. The property of tonicity is often used to illustrate the biology of the body, with the solute concentration of cells and surrounding fluids being used as an example.\n[18] Examples of Hypertonic Solutions. A hypertonic solution may be any solution that has a greater concentration of solutes outside of the cell, and one example of this is saline solutions used in medical care. Saline solutions are used to provide fluids intravenously as well as for contact lens care.\n[19] Examples of Hypertonic Solutions.

This article is about a voting system criterion. For the mathematical notion of an order preserving mapping, see monotonic function. The monotonicity criterion is a voting system criterion used to evaluate both single and multiple winner ranked voting systems.\n[3] For example, Rudin, in his Principles of Mathematical Analysis (Definition 3.13), defines a sequence $\\{s_n\\}$ of real numbers to be: (a) monotonically increasing if $s_n \\leq s_{n+1}, (n = 1, 2, 3, \\cdots)$ [i.e., non-decreasing].o. $x(0)=0, x(1)=0, x(2)=1$ is non-decreasing, but not monotonically increasing. It is monotonically increasing if $x(1)=0.5$ instead, for example.\n[4] A number of these properties can be combined. For example one can get monotonic reads combined with session level consistency. From a practical point of view these two properties (monotonic reads and read-your-writes) are most desirable in an eventually consistent system, but not always required.\n[5] In a monopolistic market, a firm maximizes its total profit by equating marginal cost to marginal revenue and solving for the price of one product and the quantity it must produce. For example, suppose a monopolist's total cost function is: P = 10Q + Q^2, where Q is the quantity.\n[6] page 1 of 3. First, let's establish some definitions: f is said to be increasing on an interval I if for all x in I, whenever. f is said to be decreasing on an interval I if for all x in I, whenever. A function is monotonic on an interval I if it is only increasing or only decreasing on I. The derivative can help us determine whether a function is increasing or decreasing on an interval. This knowledge will later allow us to sketch rough graphs of functions. Let f be continuous on [a, b] and differentiable on (a, b) . If for all x on (a, b) , then f is increasing on [a, b] . If for all x on (a, b) , then f is decreasing on [a, b] . This should make intuitive sense. In the graph below, wherever the slope of the tangent is positive, the function seems to be increasing.\n[7] This is a form of triangle inequality, with n, n', and the goal Gn closest to n. Because every monotonic heuristic is also admissible, monotonicity is a stricter requirement than admissibility. In some heuristic algorithms, such as A*, the algorithm can be considered optimal if it is monotonic.\n[8] On the negative numbers, numbers with greater absolute value have greater squares, so squaring is a monotonically decreasing function on (\u2212\u221e,0] . Hence, zero is its global minimum. The only cases where the square x2 of a number is less than x occur when, that is, when x belongs to an open interval (0,1) .\n[9] Hypertonic Example. Red blood cells are the classic example used to explain tonicity. When the concentration of salts (ions) is the same inside the blood cell as outside of it, the solution is isotonic with respect to the cells and they assume their normal shape and size.\n[10] also a monotonically decreasing function with h(0) = k\u03b2/(1\u2212p) and h(\u221e) = k\u03b2.

It is monotonically increasing if $x(1)=0.5$ instead, for example.\n[12] page 1 of 3. First, let's establish some definitions: f is said to be increasing on an interval I if for all x in I, whenever. f is said to be decreasing on an interval I if for all x in I, whenever. A function is monotonic on an interval I if it is only increasing or only decreasing on I. The derivative can help us determine whether a function is increasing or decreasing on an interval. This knowledge will later allow us to sketch rough graphs of functions. Let f be continuous on [a, b] and differentiable on (a, b) . If for all x on (a, b) , then f is increasing on [a, b] . If for all x on (a, b) , then f is decreasing on [a, b] . This should make intuitive sense. In the graph below, wherever the slope of the tangent is positive, the function seems to be increasing.\n[13] A function f (x) is concave over a convex set if and only if the function \u2212 f (x) is a convex function over the set. A differentiable function f is concave on an interval if its derivative function f \u2032 is monotonically decreasing on that interval: a concave function has a decreasing slope. Any affine function is both (non-strictly) concave and convex. 2 The sine function is concave on the interval. 3 The function, where is the determinant of a nonnegative-definite matrix B, is concave. 4 Practical example: rays bending in computation of radiowave attenuation in the atmosphere.\n[14] The first derivative test examines a function's monotonic properties (where the function is increasing or decreasing) focusing on a particular point in its domain. If the function switches from increasing to decreasing at the point, then the function will achieve a highest value at that point.\n[15] Cassandra also claims to offer monotonic read consistency, which means that if a client has seen any particular value for a key, it will never read an older value. Because system clocks are not monotonic, writes can't be monotonic either.\n[16] A monotonic relationship is an important underlying assumption of the Spearman rank-order correlation. It is also important to recognize the assumption of a monotonic relationship is less restrictive than a linear relationship (an assumption that has to be met by the Pearson product-moment correlation).\n[17] Note that just monotonic transformation of a concave function isnot necessarily concave: consider, for example f (x) = x and g (z) = z 3 .Thus the concavity of a function is not ordinal, it is cardinal property.Economic ExampleSuppose production function f (x) is concave and the cost function c (x) is convex.ote that just monotonic transformation of a concave function isnot necessarily concave: consider, for example f (x) = x and g (z) = z 3 .Thus the concavity of a function is not ordinal, it is cardinal property.Economic ExampleSuppose production function f (x) is concave and the cost function c (x) is convex.\n[18] Monotonicity criterion. This article is about a voting system criterion. For the mathematical notion of an order preserving mapping, see monotonic function. The monotonicity criterion is a voting system criterion used to evaluate both single and multiple winner ranked voting systems.\n[19] A number of these properties can be combined. For example one can get monotonic reads combined with session level consistency. From a practical point of view these two properties (monotonic reads and read-your-writes) are most desirable in an eventually consistent system, but not always required.\n[20] This is a form of triangle inequality, with n, n', and the goal Gn closest to n. Because every monotonic heuristic is also admissible, monotonicity is a stricter requirement than admissibility. In some heuristic algorithms, such as A*, the algorithm can be considered optimal if it is monotonic.\nSearch Query: example of monotonic function.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: example of monotonic function.\n\n[1] Monotonic Function. Monotonic functions are the functions which maintained the order of functions value. As we all know that the variation in independent value also make the variation in functions value. A suitable example for this is monotonic functions or linear polynomials. The monotonic functions maintains the straight line in linear programming graph. This is also called the monotonic nature over the domain and real numbers. A monotonic function increases and decreases over the interval.\n[2] Monotonic Function. A monotonic function is a function which is either entirely nonincreasing or nondecreasing. A function is monotonic if its first derivative (which need not be continuous) does not change sign.\n[3] The MONOTONIC function is an undocumented SAS function. It needs no input parameters and if any input parameters are provided, these are ingnored. The function counts the number of times it is called and returns an ascending sequence of integers, starting at 1.\n[4] To solidify our understanding of what a monotonic function is, let's consider what a non-monotonic function is. A non-monotonic function is a function that is increasing and decreasing on different intervals of its domain. For example, consider our initial example f(x) equals x 2.\n[5] Here's the definition of the monotonic function from Wikipedia: In calculus, a function f defined on a subset of the real numbers with real values is called monotonic (also monotonically increasing, increasing or non-decreasing), if for all x and y such that x \u2264 y one has f(x) \u2264 f(y), so f preserves the order.\n[6] The term monotonic may also be used to describe set functions which map subsets of the domain to non-decreasing values of the codomain. In particular, if is a set function from a collection of sets to an ordered set , then is said to be monotone if whenever as elements of , .\n[7] The MONOTONIC function is often presented as a means of adding sequence numbers to table rows. Several papers present it as a solution to this programming problem. However, the function is undocumented and has some limitations, including:\n[8] Montonic Function. When a function is increasing on its entire domain or decreasing on its entire domain, we say that the function is strictly monotonic, and we call it a monotonic function. For example, consider the function g(x) equals x 3: Notice the graph of g is increasing everywhere. Therefore, this is a monotonic function.\n[9] monotonic function. Monotonic Function. (or monotone function), a function whose increments \u0394f(x) = f(x\u2032) \u2212 f(x) do not change sign when \u0394x = x\u2032 \u2212 x > 0; that is, the increments are either always nonnegative or always nonpositive. Somewhat inaccurately, a monotonic function can be defined as a function that always varies in the same direction.\n[10] The MONOTONIC function is often presented as a means of adding sequence numbers to table rows. Several papers present it as a solution to this programming problem. If the MONOTONIC function is used in an SQL procedure that aggregates data then the function may return non-sequential or missing results.\n[11] An important application of monotonic functions is in probability theory.

Many of these suicides involve older veterans; 69 percent of the suicides recorded were by veterans age 50 and older. But another way to look at this is that 31 percent of these suicides were by veterans 49 and younger. In other words,by men in the prime of life. And then there are the shockingly common active duty suicides. Just two weeks ago, the military released data showing that suicides among those on active duty hit a record high in 2012. There were 349 suicides among active duty personnel \u2013 almost one a day.

Recreational mishaps, after motor vehicle mishaps, are the leading cause of death for off-duty Navy personnel. Approximately 15 drowning occur each year during recreational activities. Falls are the second leading cause of death. Team sports produce more injuries than any other recreational activity. Many recreational mishaps report alcohol as a contributing factor; nearly all involve human error.\n[2] Suicide is also one of the leading causes of death among this age group; the 2nd leading cause of death of males (112 deaths) and 6th for females (23 deaths). Suicide (including injury/poisoning of undetermined intent) was the leading cause of death for 20-34 year olds (24% of men and 12% of women). Factors that could lead to these deaths include: traumatic experiences, lifestyle choices such as drug or alcohol misuse, job insecurity and relationship problems.\n[3] Each service of the U.S. military posted the lowest number of deaths from motor vehicle accidents in 2012 \u2013 although motorcycle-related fatalities continues to be a leading cause of death among service members unrelated to war, according to a new study of a15-year surveillance period.\n[4] MSRC's David Rudd Predicts Suicide Rate May Continue Increasing - 2012 military suicides hit a record high of 349.

But another way to look at this is that 31 percent of these suicides were by veterans 49 and younger. In other words,by men in the prime of life. And then there are the shockingly common active duty suicides. Just two weeks ago, the military released data showing that suicides among those on active duty hit a record high in 2012.

Suicide Is Now the Leading Cause of Death Amongst Active-Duty Soldiers. In 2010, for the second year in a row, more American soldiers killed themselves than died in combat. Military officials knew they had an epidemic on their hands, but they didn't know how to mitigate the hyper-complex problem.\n[7] We suggest that moral injury is likely one of the most important factors in military suicide rates. Moral injury is not PTSD. The latter is a dysfunction of brain areas that suppress fear and integrate feeling with coherent memory; symptoms include flashbacks, nightmares, dissociative episodes and hyper-vigilance. PTSD is an immediate injury of trauma.\n[8] In 2006, the army stopped letting soldiers take their service weapons home on weekends. The suicide rate fell there, too, by 40 percent. The high rate of gun suicides in the United States is not a new problem. Even in the 1980s and 1990s, when violent crime rates were much higher, gun suicides were still a more common cause of death than gun murders.\n[9] The findings are the latest in a series of studies prompted by a military suicide rate that has nearly doubled since 2005. The study's authors and others cautioned, however, that the findings do not rule out combat exposure as a reason for the increase in suicides, adding that more information was needed.he study found that the suicide rate for troops who left the military before completing a four-year enlistment was nearly twice that of troops who stayed. The rate for troops who were involuntarily discharged under less-than-honorable conditions for disciplinary infractions was nearly three times higher.\n[10] The Top 5 Causes of Death in the United States Military.

Fancy goldfish normally grow to 8 inches (20cm). The normal life expectancy of a single tail goldfish is about 20 years.\n[2] For example, koi are larger than goldfish. They have long, lean bodies and can grow to be 2-3 feet long! Even when in the wild, goldfish grow to be no more than 1 foot long.fter all, both goldfish and koi come in a variety of colors. You may have even wondered if koi are goldfish that have gotten really big! Koi and goldfish are different types of fish, but they are both members of the carp family.\n[3] The Shubunkin Goldfish can grow very large and an adult Shubunkin Goldfish will need at least 30-40 gallons of water, while a juvenile requires around 15 gallons. The aquarium or pond should be decorated and provide the Shubunkin Goldfish with heavily planted places as well as open areas for swimming.\n[4] In the wild, goldfish can be found in slow-moving, freshwater bodies of water. As with their close relative the carp, they thrive in slightly murky water. In captivity, an aquarium with live plants and a dirt bottom is ideal. Bi-weekly water changes are a good idea as a goldfish tank is hard to keep clean. Live plants must be replaced fairly regularly; goldfish enjoy eating them. Small pebbles are a suitable substitute for the pond-like bottom.\n[5] Goldfish bowls really shouldn't exist, to be honest. Goldfish can grow very large and some have lived up to 30 years! The recommendation is that you give a goldfish 10 gallons for every inch it is. So if your goldfish is 2 inches long, ideally it would have 20 gallons. While that seems a little excessive for most people, a ten gallon tank with a filter would be a great place to start. As other people have mentioned, goldfish are considered dirty fish.\n[6] The goldfish (Carassius auratus) is a freshwater fish in the family Cyprinidae of order Cypriniformes. It is one of the most commonly kept aquarium fish. A relatively small member of the carp family (which also includes the Prussian carp and the crucian carp), the goldfish is native to east Asia. It was first selectively bred in China more than a thousand years ago, and several distinct breeds have since been developed. Goldfish breeds vary greatly in size, body shape, fin configuration and colouration (various combinations of white, yellow, orange, red, brown, and black are known).\n[7] In the wild, goldfish can be found in slow-moving, freshwater bodies of water. As with their close relative the carp, they thrive in slightly murky water. In captivity, an aquarium with live plants and a dirt bottom is ideal. Bi-weekly water changes are a good idea as a goldfish tank is hard to keep clean.\n[8] A 75 gallon tank would only be good for so long, comet goldfish can grow up to 1 foot in length (often more because of their long flowing tails), they are pond fish and belong in ponds. I would not recommend buying them for tanks.\n[9] Owners should have a tank of at least 20 gallons for no more than 35 ounces of goldfish. As the number of fish grow in the tank, the dissolved and particulate organic carbon content of the water rises, causing the bacterial load in the water to increase. A crowded fish bowl or aquarium is a mishap waiting to happen.\n[10] Goldfish particularly consume naturally occurring carp food in the wild like insects, tadpoles. Apart from this, they also eat frogs, spawn, and tadpoles. Since they are bred from wild carps, they are omnivores and eat aquatic plants, algae, smaller fish, and, other smaller water creatures. Some even release goldfish in still waters like ponds to get rid of mosquitoes, goldfish also thrives on mosquito larvae.\n[11] Goldfish Size and Life Expectancy. If kept in a suitable environment, single tail goldfish normally grow to 10 inches (25cm) and can sometimes reach 12 inches (30cm). Fancy goldfish normally grow to 8 inches (20cm).

Last week, scientists netted a 4-pound, 1.5-foot-long goldfish in Lake Tahoe. The scientists also found 15 other goldfish, indicating they're probably reproducing in the lake high in the Sierra Nevada.\n[13] Goldfish are able to live in a wide range of temperatures, so some overlap does exist. Many tropical fish can live in the mid 70s without any kind of problem, and this is also true of goldfish. It is, however, important to keep goldfish with species that require similar habitats and conditions.\n[14] Giant Goldfish: Popular Housepet Can Grow Monstrously Large, As Tahoe Catch Shows.

People who groom goldfish for shows take such extreme measures as daily 100% water changes and feeding every hour during daylight hours to produce big fish fast. Some of them also say that show fish aren't good breeders and don't live as long as fish that grow at a normal rate.\n[2] Big Fish in a Small Pond. To grow a big goldfish in a small pond, breeders focus on two main factors: food and temperature, according to Tropical Fish Data, a database on tropical fish.\n[3] Shubunkin goldfish can grow to be 12 inches, so according to this rule, you should give each goldfish 12 gallons. This guideline works better for small fish than for big goldfish. Instead, I like to follow the guideline #2 below.\n[4] Neons (Tropical) fish and Goldfish cannot be kept together.

Koi have barbels around their mouths and chins, feelers that resemble whiskers, while goldfish have no barbels. The body shapes and sizes of the two fish differ, too. Fully matured goldfish are typically 8 to 12 inches, growing to 16 inches at their largest.\n[8] In terms of a minimum temperature, goldfish can survive in water that is close to freezing, however, you should really keep your tank temperature several degrees above this in order to encourage strong growth. The most important thing is that your tank temperature does not change suddenly.\n[9] The Shubunkin Goldfish can grow very large and an adult Shubunkin Goldfish will need at least 30-40 gallons of water, while a juvenile requires around 15 gallons.\n[10] People are usually surprised at both the normal life expectancy and size that goldfish reach.

The size of your tank would indicate that it is not really large enough for keeping goldfish in. The basic rule of fishkeeping \u2026 is 1 Inch of fish needs a minimum of 1 gallon of water. Goldfish should really be kept in a pond.\n[2] Observe its size. If kept in proper tank or pond conditions, a common goldfish will be around 5 inches (12.7 cm) after a year and 9 inches (22.9 cm) after two years. You can eye your goldfish to see how large it has become. If you keep your goldfish in a small bowl, you may find that its growth is stunted.\n[3] yeah i am happy with 5-6 inches as long as the fish isn't thin and looks like it needs to grow a lot wider, as long as it has good body proportion to size im fine with that, but im happy to say that my goldfish who have shown no growth for the last 6 months have grown about half an inch longer in the last 2 weeks since i started feeding 4 times a day and also they have gone from being about half an inch wide to being an inch wide...but i think it could even be because they are females ...\n[4] Large aquariums are a definite requirement for their long-term care and survival, as goldfish can grow quite large, depending on the breed. The common goldfish, so popular on fairgrounds, are among the largest, and they are capable of reaching over 18 inches and 10 pounds. Even the smallest breeds can reach between 4 and 7 inches, making them more suitable for a 20-gallon or larger aquarium than a bowl.\n[5] The cleanliness of your pet's environment, the kinds of food, and your feeding protocols are all factors. Genetics are the predetermined factor in how big your fish will grow. Goldfish sold as tank suitable will grow to about 10 inches while those sold as pond suitable will reach a maximum of about 18 inches.\n[6] The genetics (DNA) of the goldfish parents passed on to their offspring. How fast do goldfish grow is really a tough question to answer really. As mentioned above these factors will influence the growth potential of your goldfish. For example the how clean your water is impacts how fast they will grow. If the water is too clear then lacks algae and food to feed on.\n[7] Fancy goldfish typically grow to 8 inches, while single tail goldfish grow to 10 and sometimes up to 12 inches in length. It's rare for domestic goldfish to achieve the monstrous sizes recorded in the Netherlands and Michigan; these fish were exceptions to the norm.\n[8] Goldfish can live for many years if properly cared for, a bowl is not large enough. My goldfish lived 10 years in a 27 gallon tank but may have lived longer in a pond. 1 liter won't be enough - goldfish can grow to 10 inches long or even larger than that. Thanks guys I was so worried but not anymore.\n[9] Keep your common goldfish in a pond, as they are supposed to grow to a size of almost 12 inch (30 cm). Commons come in many different color varieties, including orange, yellow, \"wild\" color (brownish) and white. Their patterns can range from an even color to all kinds of color combinations and spots.\n[10] Goldfish ponds need to provide clean, well oxygenated water for its inhabitants to grow up happy and healthy. A goldfish can grow up to 12 inches(30cm) plus. The minimum size pond is 8 feet X 6 feet and 3 feet deep(2.5m X 2m X 1m).The larger the pond the better for your goldfish. Being tempted to economise, some people end up building 2 or 3 ponds to get to the desired size.tep #3: If your pond is 8 feet X 6 feet X 4 feed deep, the liner would have to be 17 feet long and 15 feet wide.

They have long, lean bodies and can grow to be 2-3 feet long! Even when in the wild, goldfish grow to be no more than 1 foot long.fter all, both goldfish and koi come in a variety of colors. You may have even wondered if koi are goldfish that have gotten really big! Koi and goldfish are different types of fish, but they are both members of the carp family.\n[17] The Shubunkin Goldfish is usually kept in ponds, but you can keep a Shubunkin Goldfish in an aquarium as well as long as you can provide it with enough space.

Goldfish can grow very large and some have lived up to 30 years! The recommendation is that you give a goldfish 10 gallons for every inch it is. So if your goldfish is 2 inches long, ideally it would have 20 gallons. While that seems a little excessive for most people, a ten gallon tank with a filter would be a great place to start. As other people have mentioned, goldfish are considered dirty fish.\n[20] Neons (Tropical) fish and Goldfish cannot be kept together. Goldfish are cold water fish and Neons are warm water fish. Plus, to have 3 or 4 Goldfish, you would need about a 100 gallon tank, as they grow a lot.

Goldfish belong to the carp family and were domesticated in China in the Tang Dynasty. They can reach up to 59 cm in size, and 3 kg in weight. However, most goldfish grow to only half that size.\n[2] Goldfish are a temperate fish found in cool streams, lakes, and ponds throughout Asia and part of eastern Europe, though all the specimens found in the hobby today are captive bred. Goldfish can be easy to care for, however, they do require some care. Given proper care and a good, healthy environment, goldfish can sometimes live nearly 50 years! Goldfish Equipment & Maintenance: To keep a goldfish healthy, remember to provide them with plenty of clean, cool water. Your goldfish's temperature should never rise above 74\u00b0 Fahrenheit (about 23.5\u00b0 Celsius), and ideally should remain between 65\u00b0 and 68\u00b0 F (18\u00b0 and 20\u00b0 C) so you will need a thermometer.\n[3] Like their wild ancestors, common and comet goldfish as well as Shubunkin can survive, and even thrive, in any climate that can support a pond, whereas fancy goldfish are unlikely to survive in the wild as their bright colours and long fins make them easy prey. Goldfish can hybridise with certain other species of carp as well as C. a. gibelio.\n[4] Fancy Goldfish (Ryukins, orandas, fan tail, bubble eyes) - Grow about 6 inches. Ranchus, Lion heads, Pearl Scales-grow about 3 - 4 inches. Common Goldfish (comets) - They can reach lengths of 2 feet or more. Koi-grow about 12 - 24 inches, sometimes more.\n[5] How fast do goldfish grow is really a tough question to answer really. As mentioned above these factors will influence the growth potential of your goldfish. For example the how clean your water is impacts how fast they will grow. If the water is too clear then lacks algae and food to feed on.\n[6] Even at the same age, they vary a lot in length. They grow rapidly during the first year, but the growth rate varies a lot even for fish from the same spawn, so the size of year old goldfish varies widely. Almost all of the goldfish you see in the big box pet stores are well under a year in age.\n[7] No, a fish bowl is just too small for a fish that has the potential to grow over 12 inches in length. A goldfish needs an aquarium of at least 30 gallons (with proper filtrati \u2026 on and aeration) to thrive. Only a betta can live in a fish bowl. Goldfish generally don't get as big as they say but they do get large.\n[8] Genetics are the predetermined factor in how big your fish will grow. Goldfish sold as tank suitable will grow to about 10 inches while those sold as pond suitable will reach a maximum of about 18 inches.\n[9] The common goldfish is typically sold for less than $0.25 as a \"feeder\" goldfish and sold when it is very small. However, though it may start out less than 1 inch long a typical comet can grow up to 1 foot in length and live as long as 20 years if healthy. And that fact alone should make it clear to you that a bowl is not a suitable home for your goldfish.\n[10] Goldfish commonly grow to over 12 inches.

The other steak was cooked sous vide to the same temperature and then seared with a blowtorch to yield a juicier steak that is done to perfection from edge to edge. Similarly, beef short ribs braised at 58 \u00b0C / 136 \u00b0F for 72 hours are melt-in-your-mouth tender, yet pink and juicy.\n[18] Cooking at a lower temperature using sous-vide allows you to get that same \"kill\" rate of bacteria without sacrificing the quality of the meat or vegetables. The time and temperature combinations for beef can be found from the Food Safety and Inspection Service guidelines.he advisory panel found that the FSIS figures for poultry were way too high. The FSIS recommends temperature and time enough to kill 99.99999 percent of the bacteria but the panel recommended enough to kill 99.995 percent of the bacteria.\n[19] It is possible to duplicate some effects of sous-vide techniques through the use of a beer cooler filled with warm water, checked with an accurate thermometer, and ziploc bags with the air removed to package the food for cooking.\n[20] The best torches for searing sous vide are ones designed for industrial uses such as soldering copper pipes, brazing and hardening steel, as well as light welding.

When an action potential is conducted down the axon, this is where it goes.\n[3] The synapse subserves the transmission of nerve impulses, commonly from a club-shaped axon terminal (the presynaptic element) to the circumscript patch of the plasma membrane of the receiving cell (the postsynaptic element) on which the synapse occurs.\n[4] The axon is a key component of nerve cells over which information is transmitted from one part of the neuron (e.g., the cell body) to the terminal regions of the neuron. Axons can be rather long extending up to a meter or so in some human sensory and motor nerve cells.\n[5] At the neuromuscular junction (figure to the right) the terminal branch of the motor axon lies in a shallow groove, or synaptic trough, on the muscle cell. The muscle plasma membrane that forms the synaptic trough is pleated to form postjunctional folds.\n[6] Neurotransmitters are packaged into synaptic vesicles that cluster beneath the axon terminal membrane on the presynaptic side of a synapse. The axonal terminals are specialized to release the electrical impulse of the presynaptic cell.ctivity at an axon terminal: Neuron A is transmitting a signal at the axon terminal to neuron B (receiving). Features: 1. Mitochondrion.\n[7] synapse. the junction between the processes of two neurons or between a neuron and an effector organ, where neural impulses are transmitted by chemical means. The impulse causes the release of a neurotransmitter (e.g. acetylcholine or norepinephrine) from the presynaptic membrane of the axon terminal.ynapse. SYNAPSE: Axon terminal synapse. The space between the junction of two neurons in a neural pathway, where the termination of the axon of one neuron comes into close proximity with the cell body or dendrites of another.\n[8] Synapse. As an electrical impulse travels down the tail of the cell, called the axon and arrives at its terminal, it triggers vesicles containing a neurotransmitter to move toward the terminal membrane. The vesicles fuse with the terminal membrane to release their contents.\n[9] Axons and dendrites differ in terms of structure. The term dendrite is derived from the Greek dendron, which means tree. Microscopically, dendrites have a treelike appearance, are heavily branched, and have multiple boutons, terminal knobs, or synaptic knobs. These knobs give dendrites a rough appearance.\n[10] An axon (from Greek \u1f04\u03be\u03c9\u03bd ax\u014dn, \u00e1x\u014dn), axis also known as a nerve, fibre is a, long slender projection of a nerve, cell or, neuron that typically conducts electrical impulses away from the'neuron s cell. Body the function of the axon is to transmit information to different, neurons muscles and. glandsxons make contact with other cells\u2014usually other neurons but sometimes muscle or gland cells\u2014at junctions called synapses. At a synapse, the membrane of the axon closely adjoins the membrane of the target cell, and special molecular structures serve to transmit electrical or electrochemical signals across the gap.\n[11] Axons make contact with other cells\u2014usually other neurons but sometimes muscle or gland cells\u2014at junctions called synapses. At a synapse, the membrane of the axon closely adjoins the membrane of the target cell, and special molecular structures serve to transmit electrical or electrochemical signals across the gap.n axon is one of two types of protoplasmic protrusions that extrude from the cell body of a neuron, the other type being dendrites.\n[12] The sequence of events at a synapse is as follows : 1) A nerve impulse reaches the axon terminal of a presynaptic neuron; the membrane is depolarised by an action potential. 2) Depolarisation of the axon terminal during the action potential causes voltage sensitive calcium ion channels to open in the terminal knob.he sequence of events at a synapse is as follows : 1) A nerve impulse reaches the axon terminal of a presynaptic neuron; the membrane is depolarised by an action potential. 2) Depolarisation of the axon terminal during the action potential causes voltage sensitive calcium ion channels to open in the terminal knob.\n[13] The axon is a longer, single processes of the cell soma and relay signals towards the tip, which is called synaptic terminal. There are three main types of neurons: (1) sensory neuron, (2) interneuron, and (3) motor neuron. The nerve cells of the central nervous system are all interneurons. In human brain, there are about 100 billion interneurons. Example is the Golgi cell found in the cerebellum. The interneurons receive impulses from the sensory neurons.\n[14] The axon,which carries impulses away from the cell body, carries information via electrical impulse to its end (terminal) where neurotransmitters (chemical substances) are released into the synapse,a tiny junction between neurons. They traverse to the other side and bind to receptors on another neuron's dendrite.\n[15] axon.

The axonal terminals are specialized to release the electrical impulse of the presynaptic cell.\n[17] The axon is wrapped in myelin, which ensheathes some sections but leaves sections of the axon bare between the sheathed portions. At its far end, the axon splits up into many axon terminal. Each forms a synapse with a dendrite or cell body of another neuron. The cell to which the axon terminal belongs (sending cell) is called the presynaptic cell, while the cell to which the dendrite or cell body belongs (receiving cell) is called the postsynaptic cell. There is a space between the two cells, across which they communicate.\n[18] The synaptic knob contains vesicles filled with neurotransmitters. Therefore, Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter that stimulates skeletal muscle to contract. It is rele \u2026 ased into the synaptic clefts between motor neuron axons and motor end plates.\n[19] A presynaptic neuron has several specialized structures that distinguish it from a postsynaptic neuron. The terminal button of the presynaptic neuron's axon contains mitochondria as well as microtubules that transport the neurotransmitters from the cell body (where they are produced) to the tip of the axon.\n[20] The area in the axon that holds groups of vesicles is an axon terminal or bouton. Up to 130 vesicles can be released per bouton over a ten-minute period of stimulation at 0.2 Hz. In the human brain region V1 synaptic vesicles have an average diameter of 39.5 nanometers with a standard deviation of 5.1 nanometers.ith the advent of modern electron microscopic techniques in the early 1950s, nerve endings were found to contain a large number of electron-lucent vesicles. The term synaptic vesicle was first introduced by De Robertis and Bennett in 1954.\nSearch Query: axon terminals or synaptic knob definition.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

The space between the junction of two neurons in a neural pathway, where the termination of the axon of one neuron comes into close proximity with the cell body or dendrites of another.\n[2] The axon, with its surrounded sheath, is called a nerve fiber. Between each pair of sucessive Schwann cells is a gap of a node of Ranvier. The Axon Hillock The axon hillock is where the axon is joined to the cell. It is from here that the electrical firing known as an action potential usually occurs. 5. Nerve Ending (Presynaptic Terminals) Synapses are the junctions formed with other nerve cells where the presynaptic terminal of one cell comes into 'contact' with the postsynaptic membrane of another. It is at these junctions that neurons are excited, inhibited, or modulated. There are two types of synapse, electrical and chemical.\n[3] What is the structure at the end of an axon that produces neurotransmitters? The axon is a single process extending from the axon hillock,sometimes covered by a fatty layer called a myelin sheath thatconducts nerve impulses away from the cell body of t \u2026 he neuron. Distal tips of axons are telodendria, each of which terminates in a synaptic knob.\n[4] axon definition. The part of a nerve cell or neuron that transfers a nerve impulse from the nerve cell body to a synapse with another cell. (See action potential.) Depending on the location of the cell, the length of an axon can vary widely. In some cases (such as the axons that form the spinal cord), they may be several feet long.\n[5] An action potential (or impulse, if you like) reaches the presynaptic knob. This causes calcium gates in the membrane to open, and an there is an influx of calcium ions into the axon.this causes vesicles (like little sacks) containing transmitter substance, to move towards, and fuse with, the synaptic membrane. synapse is a junction where two nerves meets. when action potential reaches a synapse, the pores open allowing an afflux of calcium ions into presynaptic terminal.\n[6] These signals are transmitted electrically across the soma and down a major extension from the soma known as the axon, which ends at multiple terminal buttons. The terminal buttons contain synaptic vesicles that house neurotransmitters, the chemical messengers of the nervous system.\n[7] The junction between the axon terminals of a neuron and the receiving cell is called a synapse. (Synapses at muscle fibers are also called neuromuscular junctions or myoneural junctions 1 .). Action potentials travel down the axon of the neuron to its end(s), the axon terminal(s).xcitatory synapses. The neurotransmitter at excitatory synapses depolarizes the postsynaptic membrane (of a neuron in this diagram). 1 Binding of acetylcholine to its receptors on the postsynaptic cell opens up ligand-gated sodium channels. 2 These allow an influx of Na + ions, reducing the membrane potential.\n[8] The junction between the axon terminals of a neuron and the receiving cell is called a synapse. (Synapses at muscle fibers are also called neuromuscular junctions or myoneural junctions 1 .). Action potentials travel down the axon of the neuron to its end(s), the axon terminal(s). Transmission between neurons is as much as ten times faster than in chemical synapses. 2 Thus electrical synapses can mediate, for example, the very rapid escape response of crayfish that encounter a threat. 3 Electrical synapses in the CNS permit groups of interneurons to fire together.\n[9] The synapse is located at the end of each axonal end branch. Here the end branch forms a small button-like knob, referred to as the synaptic knob. This knob is adjacent to a tiny cleft or synapse. When a nerve impulse reaches this knob, a drug called a neurotransmitter is released from vesicles into the synapse. The neurotransmitter diffuses across the gap and binds to receptors on the membrane of the adjacent neuron or muscle cell.\n[10] 4. At the axon or presynaptic terminal, the action potentials open voltage-gated calcium channels to open, allowing calcium to enter the cell. This leads to the release of the neurotransmitters from the terminal into the synaptic cleft (space between the presynaptic and postsynaptic neuron).\n[11] The sequence of events at a synapse is as follows : 1) A nerve impulse reaches the axon terminal of a presynaptic neuron; the membrane is depolarised by an action potential. 2) Depolarisation of the axon terminal during the action potential causes voltage sensitive calcium ion channels to open in the terminal knob.he sequence of events at a synapse is as follows : 1) A nerve impulse reaches the axon terminal of a presynaptic neuron; the membrane is depolarised by an action potential. 2) Depolarisation of the axon terminal during the action potential causes voltage sensitive calcium ion channels to open in the terminal knob.\n[12] Axons and dendrites differ in terms of structure.

Above From:Hole's essentials of Human Anatomy & Physiology (tenth edition).\n[8] An axon (from Greek \u1f04\u03be\u03c9\u03bd ax\u014dn, \u00e1x\u014dn), axis is a, long slender projection of a nerve, cell or, neuron that typically conducts electrical impulses away from the'neuron s cell. Body myelinated axons are known as nerve. Fibers the function of the axon is to transmit information to different, neurons muscles and. glandshen an action potential reaches a presynaptic terminal, it activates the synaptic transmission process. The first step is rapid opening of calcium ion channels in the membrane of the axon, allowing calcium ions to flow inward across the membrane.\n[9] The axon terminals of all neurons end at another structure that they stimulate (or inhibit). The connection between the two is called a synapse. Depending on the neuron, the synapse may be with another neuron (for sensory and interneurons) or a muscle fiber or a gland cell (for motor neurons).\n[10] The plasma membrane of postsynaptic cell has receptors for the neurotransmitters in the vesicles of the synaptic knob. When an action potential is generated, it travels (propagates) the length an axon to the synapatic knobs, where it signals the synaptic vesicles to release some of the stored neurotransmitters.\n[11] The sequence of events at a synapse is as follows : 1) A nerve impulse reaches the axon terminal of a presynaptic neuron; the membrane is depolarised by an action potential. 2) Depolarisation of the axon terminal during the action potential causes voltage sensitive calcium ion channels to open in the terminal knob.he sequence of events at a synapse is as follows : 1) A nerve impulse reaches the axon terminal of a presynaptic neuron; the membrane is depolarised by an action potential. 2) Depolarisation of the axon terminal during the action potential causes voltage sensitive calcium ion channels to open in the terminal knob.\n[12] Axons and dendrites differ in terms of structure. The term dendrite is derived from the Greek dendron, which means tree. Microscopically, dendrites have a treelike appearance, are heavily branched, and have multiple boutons, terminal knobs, or synaptic knobs. These knobs give dendrites a rough appearance.\n[13] What is the structure at the end of an axon that produces neurotransmitters? The axon is a single process extending from the axon hillock,sometimes covered by a fatty layer called a myelin sheath thatconducts nerve impulses away from the cell body of t \u2026 he neuron. Distal tips of axons are telodendria, each of which terminates in a synaptic knob.\n[14] The synapse is located at the end of each axonal end branch. Here the end branch forms a small button-like knob, referred to as the synaptic knob. This knob is adjacent to a tiny cleft or synapse. When a nerve impulse reaches this knob, a drug called a neurotransmitter is released from vesicles into the synapse. The neurotransmitter diffuses across the gap and binds to receptors on the membrane of the adjacent neuron or muscle cell.\n[15] The synaptic knob contains vesicles filled with neurotransmitters. Therefore, Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter that stimulates skeletal muscle to contract. It is rele \u2026 ased into the synaptic clefts between motor neuron axons and motor end plates.\n[16] In Human Anatomy and Physiology. The synaptic knob contains vesicles filled with neurotransmitters. Therefore, Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter that stimulates skeletal muscle to contract. It is rele\u2026ased into the synaptic clefts between motor neuron axons and motor end plates.\n[17] An action potential (or impulse, if you like) reaches the presynaptic knob. This causes calcium gates in the membrane to open, and an there is an influx of calcium ions into the axon.this causes vesicles (like little sacks) containing transmitter substance, to move towards, and fuse with, the synaptic membrane. synapse is a junction where two nerves meets. when action potential reaches a synapse, the pores open allowing an afflux of calcium ions into presynaptic terminal.\n[18] Postsynaptic neurons conduct electrical signals away from a synapse. However, the same neuron in a chain of interconnected neurons can be a postsynaptic neuron to one group of neurons and a presynaptic neuron to another group of neurons.) A nerve impulse reaches the axon terminal of a presynaptic neuron; the membrane is depolarised by an action potential. 2) Depolarisation of the axon terminal during the action potential causes voltage sensitive calcium ion channels to open in the terminal knob.\n[19] Neurotransmitters are packaged into synaptic vesicles that cluster beneath the axon terminal membrane on the presynaptic side of a synapse. The axonal terminals are specialized to release the electrical impulse of the presynaptic cell.ctivity at an axon terminal: Neuron A is transmitting a signal at the axon terminal to neuron B (receiving). Features: 1. Mitochondrion.\n[20] The axon is a single long tube that extends from the soma with multiple branchings at the end of it. The main function of the axon is to carry a message from the soma to the terminal buttons, which are the structures at the end of the axon that release the neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft.The dendrites are the smaller tree-like branchings that project from the soma.he axon is a single long tube that extends from the soma with multiple branchings at the end of it.

Each branch ends in a synaptic knob(Terminal button), a little swelling that forms a junction (synapse) with the next cell. It contains synaptic vesicles full of neurotransmitters.\n[9] Axon terminals (also called synaptic boutons) are distal terminations of the branches of an axon. An axon nerve fiber is a long, slender projection of a nerve cell, or neuron, that conducts electrical impulses (called action potentials) away from the neuron's cell body, or soma, in order to transmit those impulses to other neurons.\n[10] noun, singular: axon terminal. Button-like endings of axons through which axons make synaptic contacts with other nerve cells or with effector cells. Supplement. Axon terminals refer to the axon endings that are somewhat enlarged and often club-or button-shaped.\n[11] What is the term used to describe the rounded areas on the ends of the axon terminals? a) synaptic vesicles Incorrect. Synaptic vesicles are structures within the synaptic knobs. b) axons c) dendrites d) synaptic knobs Correct. Synaptic knobs are located at the tip of each axon terminal.\n[12] The dendrites don't have terminating knobs at the end of it. The axons are what conduct action potentials away from the cell body. The axon is not an axon because it's long, it's an axon because of the existence of synaptic knobs at the axon terminals. When the axon conducts action potentials away from the cell body and the signal goes to the synaptic knob, it's going to release a neurotransmitter in response to the electrical signal.\n[13] The junction between the axon terminals of a neuron and the receiving cell is called a synapse. (Synapses at muscle fibers are also called neuromuscular junctions or myoneural junctions 1 .). Action potentials travel down the axon of the neuron to its end(s), the axon terminal(s).2 Each axon terminal is swollen forming a synaptic knob.Synapses at muscle fibers are also called neuromuscular junctions or myoneural junctions 1 .). Action potentials travel down the axon of the neuron to its end(s), the axon terminal(s). 2 Each axon terminal is swollen forming a synaptic knob.\n[14] The sequence of events at a synapse is as follows : 1) A nerve impulse reaches the axon terminal of a presynaptic neuron; the membrane is depolarised by an action potential. 2) Depolarisation of the axon terminal during the action potential causes voltage sensitive calcium ion channels to open in the terminal knob.he sequence of events at a synapse is as follows : 1) A nerve impulse reaches the axon terminal of a presynaptic neuron; the membrane is depolarised by an action potential. 2) Depolarisation of the axon terminal during the action potential causes voltage sensitive calcium ion channels to open in the terminal knob.\n[15] 2) Synaptic Cleft: This is the narrow gap between the axon terminal of the presynaptic neuron, and the post-synaptic membrane of another excitable cell. It is filled with extracellular fluid. 3) Postsynaptic membrane: The membrane across the synaptic cleft is called the postsynaptic membrane.) A nerve impulse reaches the axon terminal of a presynaptic neuron; the membrane is depolarised by an action potential. 2) Depolarisation of the axon terminal during the action potential causes voltage sensitive calcium ion channels to open in the terminal knob.\n[16] Presynaptic Knob Definition of Presynaptic Knob :An area at the end of an axon that contains neurotransmitters in synaptic vesicles. Presynaptic Knob is part of the Chemical Synapse Component group.\n[17] \u2013Axon terminal \u2013branches at the end of axon. \u2013Synaptic bulb (knob) \u2013rounded area on the end of the axon terminal. \u2013Synaptic cleft (gap)\u2013space between bulb of one cell and the dendrite of another. \u2013Receptor sites- holes is surface of dendrite; shaped to receive certain neurotransmitters.\n[18] 1 Each axon terminal is swollen forming a synaptic knob. 2 The synaptic knob is filled with membrane-enclosed vesicles containing a neurotransmitter. 3 Arrival of an action potential at the synaptic knob opens Ca 2+ channels in the plasma membrane. The synaptic knob is filled with membrane-enclosed vesicles containing a neurotransmitter. 2 Arrival of an action potential at the synaptic knob opens Ca 2+ channels in the plasma membrane. 3 The influx of Ca 2+ triggers the exocytosis of some of the vesicles.\n[19] The sequence of events at a synapse is as follows : 1) A nerve impulse reaches the axon terminal of a presynaptic neuron; the membrane is depolarised by an action potential. 2) Depolarisation of the axon terminal during the action potential causes voltage sensitive calcium ion channels to open in the terminal knob.) Synaptic Cleft: This is the narrow gap between the axon terminal of the presynaptic neuron, and the post-synaptic membrane of another excitable cell. It is filled with extracellular fluid. 3) Postsynaptic membrane: The membrane across the synaptic cleft is called the postsynaptic membrane.\n[20] b) an axon and a dendrite of another neuron (axo-dendritic synapse), c) between the axon terminals (telodendria) of a neuron and the terminal regions of another neuron (axo-axonic synapses). Synapses are essential for homeostasis as they can either transmit or inhibit impulses.) A nerve impulse reaches the axon terminal of a presynaptic neuron; the membrane is depolarised by an action potential. 2) Depolarisation of the axon terminal during the action potential causes voltage sensitive calcium ion channels to open in the terminal knob.\nSearch Query: axon terminals or synaptic knob definition.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Exons are the nucleotide sequences of genes that are expressed, and those are found at either sides of an intron. In simple terms, it could be stated that exons really hit the ground in the expression of genes or in the protein synthesis.The polypeptide strand is formed based on the nucleotide sequence in exons. Exons are found at the two ends of a gene while introns are always found inside the gene. \u2022 When mutations take place, introns sometimes contribute nucleotides but usually not the other way around. \u2022 Both DNA and RNA contain introns and exons, but mature RNA only contain exons and not the introns.\n[2] Exons, Introns, Codons, & their equivalents. Three common technical terms in molecular genetics, exon, intron, and codon, have specific technical definitions, but are often miss-used in hurried or short-hand presentations. The main thing to remember is that exon and introns are features of DNA, whereas codons are features of RNA.\n[3] By definition, exons and introns are sequences in a protein-coding gene region of a double-stranded DNA molecule (dsDNA) that are expressed as proteins, or intervening sequences not so expressed. The exon and intron sequences are typicallly visualized as the Sense Strand of the dsDNA, written 5'-3', left to right.\n[4] Exon (disambiguation). may refer to: Exon, a region of DNA that is represented in the mature form of RNA | Exoniensis or Exon., the Post-Nominal Letters for alumni / degrees from the University of Exeter | Exon can also refer to the signature of the Bishop of Exeter | J... en\u200b.wikipedia\u200b.org\u200b/wiki\u200b/Exon (disambiguation).\n[5] Always happy to ask and answer questions.

A great way to remember this is by considering introns as intervening sequences and exons as expressed sequences. (1) According to researchers, there are an average of 8.8 exons and 7.8 introns per human gene.\n[15] DNA is composed of sections known as exons and introns. The exons are the portions that eventually exit the nucleus in the form of mRNA and are used in translation. The introns are removed from the mRNA shortly after transcription.There are a number of hypotheses about the function of introns.One hypothesis is that alternative splicing may allow a single gene to code for more than one version of a protein. In other words a piece of the gene may be an intron in one case and an exon in another case.Another possible explanation is that each exon codes for a module of a protein.ne hypothesis is that alternative splicing may allow a single gene to code for more than one version of a protein.

Introns are involved however they dont carry the genetic information that exons carry, the variation provides for revolutio \u2026 nary flexibility allowing cells to shuffle exons between genes to make new ones.aking the world better, one answer at a time. The difference between exons and introns is that exons are codes of proteins, while introns are not involved with the coding for proteins.\n[18] Genes contain exons which are regions coding for proteins and which are interrupted by the unused sequences called introns. Exons have been found to include both sequences coding for amino acids and untranslated sequences. The introns are removed and the exons are joined together to form the final functional mRNA.\n[19] Introns and exons are parts of genes. exons code for proteins, whereas introns do not. Exons are parts of DNA that are converted into mature messenger RNA . The process by which DNA is used as a template to create mRNA is called transcription.\n[20] Eukaryotic genes are split up into parts that are expressed as RNA products and parts that are not. The parts that are expressed are called exons. They appear in short sequences scattered throughout the gene. Exons are the parts of a eukaryotic gene that are expressed through transcription and translation.\nSearch Query: exons definition biology.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Exons are the nucleotide sequences of genes that are expressed, and those are found at either sides of an intron. In simple terms, it could be stated that exons really hit the ground in the expression of genes or in the protein synthesis.The polypeptide strand is formed based on the nucleotide sequence in exons. Exons are found at the two ends of a gene while introns are always found inside the gene. \u2022 When mutations take place, introns sometimes contribute nucleotides but usually not the other way around. \u2022 Both DNA and RNA contain introns and exons, but mature RNA only contain exons and not the introns.\n[12] Exons, Introns, Codons, & their equivalents. Three common technical terms in molecular genetics, exon, intron, and codon, have specific technical definitions, but are often miss-used in hurried or short-hand presentations. The main thing to remember is that exon and introns are features of DNA, whereas codons are features of RNA.\n[13] By definition, exons and introns are sequences in a protein-coding gene region of a double-stranded DNA molecule (dsDNA) that are expressed as proteins, or intervening sequences not so expressed. The exon and intron sequences are typicallly visualized as the Sense Strand of the dsDNA, written 5'-3', left to right.\n[14] Always happy to ask and answer questions. Exons are the coding regions which bear codons, each codon representing one amino acid. Thus exons are directly responsible for the amino acid sequence of the proteins. Introns are intervening sequences and bear no coding regions and cannot influence the protein sequence.efore the RNA leaves the nucleus, the introns are removed and the exons are joined together, producing an mRNA molecule with a continuous coding sequence. This process is cal \u2026 led RNA splicing.\n[15] The nucleic acid sequence in the DNA, or RNA transcript following genetic splicing. Supplement.

Ventricular hypertrophy (VH) is thickening of the walls of a ventricle (lower chamber) of the heart.(1)(2) Although left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is more common, right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), as well as concurrent hypertrophy of both ventricles can also occur.\n[2] Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy happens when the heart muscle enlarges and thickens without an obvious cause. Usually the ventricles, the lower chambers of the heart, and septum (the wall that separates the left and right side of the heart) thicken.\n[3] Untreated, RVH can lead to a weakened heart or even heart failure. When the muscle thickens around one of the hearts lower chambers, it is a condition known as ventricular hypertrophy. The thicker heart muscle loses elasticity over time, causing the heart to work harder to effectively pump blood to the lungs, brain and the rest of the body.\n[4] Hypertrophy is a heart ailment that could occur in either ventricle of the heart. Consequently, right ventricular hypertrophy is the enlargement of heart's right ventricle. And more often than not, this condition is attributed to pulmonary hypertension. Right ventricular hypertrophy, or simply RVH, is considered to be one of the rare diseases of the heart.\n[5] As enlargement progresses, though, the heart's pumping ability declines. Dilated cardiomyopathy is the main type of cardiomegaly. In dilated cardiomyopathy, the walls of both the left and right side of the heart (ventricles) become thin and stretched. The result is an enlarged heart. In the other types of enlarged heart, the heart's muscular left ventricle becomes abnormally thick. High blood pressure usually causes left ventricular enlargement (hypertrophy), while hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is an inherited condition.\n[6] What is left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)? The right and left sides of your heart do different jobs. The right side takes in blood that has travelled round the body and pumps it to the lungs. From here, the blood enters the left side of the heart from where it is pumped all round your body. Because the left side of the heart has to work harder to get blood round your body, it is usually this side that becomes enlarged when your blood pressure is too high. This is sometimes called left ventricular hypertrophy or LVH for short. In other words, it is another name for an enlarged heart. People with high blood pressure and an enlarged left side of the heart have four times the risk of a heart attack than someone with the same blood pressure but a normal-sized heart.\n[7] Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is very common and can affect people of any age. It affects men and women equally. It is a common cause of sudden cardiac arrest in young people, including young athletes. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy occurs if heart muscle cells enlarge and cause the walls of the ventricles (usually the left ventricle) to thicken.\n[8] Group 2: Pulmonary hypertension caused by left-sided heart disease. Left-sided valvular heart disease, such as mitral valve or aortic valve disease; Failure of the lower left heart chamber (left ventricle) Group 3: Pulmonary hypertension caused by lung disease. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, such as emphysema\n[9] Causes: 1 On a healthy heart, ventricular extrasystoles occur in the following situations: excessive consumption of coffee, tobacco abuse, emotions, stress; 2 On a diseased heart: coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, mitral regurgitation, left ventricular arrhythmogenic dysplasia;\n[10] Almost anything that can cause right ventricular hypertrophy can be treated if youre aware of that underlying cause, Dr. Bott-Silverman says. I dont know that theres anything that can reverse it, but you can keep it from getting worse. Its kind of the end result of a lot of different insults to the heart.\n[11] Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common genetic cardiac disease, and occurs when there is marked left ventricular hypertrophy in the absence of inciting factors, such as hypertension.\n[12] Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a complex type of heart disease that affects the heart muscle. It causes thickening of the heart muscle (especially the ventricles, or lower heart chambers), left ventricular stiffness, mitral valve changes and cellular changes.ypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a complex type of heart disease that affects the heart muscle.

Learn symptoms and more.\n[14] What is Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)? Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a thickening (hypertrophy) of the muscles of the wall of the left ventricle of the heart causing the heart to be less able to relax between contractions. In some cases, this can lead to an increase in pressure in the left atrium which then enlarges.\n[15] asymmetrical septal hypertrophy (ASH) hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, sometimes specifically that in which the hypertrophy is localized to the interventricular septum. benign prostatic hypertrophy see under hyperplasia. ventricular hypertrophy hypertrophy of the myocardium of a ventricle, due to chronic pressure overload. a hypertrophy denotes an increase in the size or number of constituent fibers of a muscle. Any other condition such as inflammation, tumor, and fatty infiltration that increases the size of a muscle is called. pseudohypertrophy. True or physiologic hypertrophy results from excessive activity of muscle.\n[16] Doctors give trusted, helpful answers on causes, diagnosis, symptoms, treatment, and more: Dr. Dhingra on can high blood pressure cause heart murmur: Hypertension causes left ventricular hypertrophy and strain and heart failure. Concomitant coronary disease can occur and infarction can happen hypertension is also asso.\n[17] The ventricle size often remains normal, but the thickening may block blood flow out of the ventricle. If this happens, the condition is called obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Sometimes the septum, the wall that divides the left and right sides of the heart, thickens and bulges into the left ventricle.\n[18] The underlying commonality in these disease states is an increase in pressures that the ventricles experience. For example, in tetralogy of Fallot, the right ventricle is exposed to the high pressures of the left heart due to a defect in the septum; as a result the right ventricle undergoes hypertrophy to compensate for these increased pressures.\n[19] However, there are other conditions in which elevated T-waves can present such as myocardial infarction (heart attack), or a condition known as left ventricular hypertrophy in which the chamber of the heart responsible for pumping your blood to the rest of your body becomes enlarged (probably due to being overworked).\n[20] Hypertensive heart disease is the No. 1 cause of death associated with high blood pressure.

HCM also may cause thickening in other parts of the heart muscle, such as the bottom of the heart called the apex, right ventricle, or throughout the entire left ventricle.\n[2] Treatment for left ventricular hypertrophy depends on the underlying cause, and may involve medication or surgery. Treating high blood pressure Your doctor is likely to recommend lifestyle changes, including:\n[3] MI, heart failure, renal failure,strokes, impaired vision, hypertrophy of left ventricle. Hypertension can result from increases in cardiac output or peripheral resistance. increases in cardiac output are often related to expansion of blood volume. suggested causes of hypertension.\n[4] Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can cause obstruction of blood as it exits the heart (left ventricle). This does not occur in all patients. A pressure gradient is generated between the heart and the aorta (the large blood vessel that the heart pumps blood into as it.\n[5] Treatment of Right Ventricular Hypertrophy The doctors of the patients with right ventricular hypertrophy addresses all the underlying causes of the disease to eventually treat it. The list of causes includes hypertension, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, hemochromatosis, and pulmonary blood clots, to name a few.\n[6] The World Health Organization classifies human. pulmonary hypertension into five groups based on the. inciting cause (see box on page 7). Pulmonary hypertension causes pressure overload. on the right heart and can result in right ventricular. enlargement (concentric hypertrophy or thickening). This is called cor pulmonale. Acute cor pulmonale, most often caused by massive thromboembolic dis-. ease, results in right ventricular dilation, tricuspid.\n[7] An increase or enlargement in the size of the right ventricle of the heart is called right ventricular hypertrophy. Edema in the ankles, legs, and feet may be a manifestation of right ventricular hypertrophy. Severe enlargement of the right venticule can cause shortness of breath and chest pain. Along with discovering an enlarged heart, a chest x-ray can expose other conditions that may have lead to the enlargement.\n[8] However, high blood pressure, or hypertension, is the most common cause by far. Higher pressures within blood vessels put a strain on the ventricle, making it difficult to satisfy the body's needs. Also, narrowing of the aortic valve, or stenosis, obstructs blood flow from the left ventricle. In patients with HCM, the ventricle can become thick and stiff, which adds extra strain on the heart.\n[9] With hypertrophic obstructive. cardiomyopathy (HOCM), the muscle thickening restricts the flow of blood out of the heart.

This hypertrophy or thickening can progress to severe problems with obstruction of blood flow and relaxation of the left ventricle.\n[3] Incidence of Basal Septal Bulge in Echocardiographic Referrals. Background: Left ventricular septal hypertrophy is an adaptive response to physiologic and pathologic stress. Hypertrophy of the interventricular septum is dominant at the basal portion in hypertensive patients and at the mid-portion in patients with HCM. A morphologic variant labelled a \"septal bulge\" occurs typically in the elderly population and may cause confusion with pathological states. This study sought to assess the incidence of basal septal bulge in echocardiographic referrals at our institution.\n[4] Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a complex type of heart disease that affects the heart muscle. It causes thickening of the heart muscle (especially the ventricles, or lower heart chambers), left ventricular stiffness, mitral valve changes and cellular changes.\n[5] A. there are several explanations for the enlargement of the heart that occurs due to Aortic stenosis. the most reasonable is that the mechanical power that the heart uses makes it bigger. this is called Left Ventricular Hypertrophy or LVH in abbreviations. this is a classic LVH E.C.G.\n[6] Glossary of Terms. Cardiac Hypertrophy. Cardiac hypertrophy is a thickening of the heart muscle (myocardium) which results in a decrease in size of the chamber of the heart, including the left and right ventricles. A common cause of cardiac hypertrophy is high blood pressure (hypertension) and heart valve stenosis.\n[7] Dilated cardiomyopathy, which is the main type of cardiomegaly. In this condition, the walls of both the left and right side of the heart (ventricles) become thin and stretched. The result is an enlarged heart.In the other types of cardiomegaly, the heart's large muscular left ventricle becomes abnormally thick.Hypertrophy is the usually what causes left ventricular enlargement. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is typically an inherited condition.n this condition, the walls of both the left and right side of the heart (ventricles) become thin and stretched. The result is an enlarged heart. In the other types of cardiomegaly, the heart's large muscular left ventricle becomes abnormally thick. Hypertrophy is the usually what causes left ventricular enlargement.\n[8] Symptoms can include chest pain, dizziness, shortness of breath, or fainting. HCM also can affect the heart's mitral valve, causing blood to leak backward through the valve. Sometimes, the thickened heart muscle doesn't block blood flow out of the left ventricle.This is called non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.The entire ventricle may thicken, or the thickening may happen only at the bottom of the heart. The right ventricle also may be affected.CM is a common cause of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) in young people, including young athletes. HCM occurs if heart muscle cells enlarge and cause the walls of the ventricles (usually the left ventricle) to thicken. Despite this thickening, the ventricle size often remains normal.\n[9] Ventricular hypertrophy. Ventricular hypertrophy (VH) is thickening of the walls of a ventricle (lower chamber) of the heart. Although left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is more common, right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) can also occur, as can hypertrophy of both ventricles, that is, biventricular hypertrophy (BVH).\n[10] Right ventricular hypertrophy. Right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) is a form of ventricular hypertrophy affecting the right ventricle. Blood travels through the right ventricle to the lungs via the pulmonary arteries. If conditions occur which decrease pulmonary circulation, meaning blood does not flow well from the heart to the lungs, extra stress can be placed on the right ventricle. This can lead to right ventricular hypertrophy.\n[11] What is left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)? The right and left sides of your heart do different jobs. The right side takes in blood that has travelled round the body and pumps it to the lungs. From here, the blood enters the left side of the heart from where it is pumped all round your body. Because the left side of the heart has to work harder to get blood round your body, it is usually this side that becomes enlarged when your blood pressure is too high. This is sometimes called left ventricular hypertrophy or LVH for short. In other words, it is another name for an enlarged heart. People with high blood pressure and an enlarged left side of the heart have four times the risk of a heart attack than someone with the same blood pressure but a normal-sized heart.\n[12] Left Ventricular Hypertrophy or LVH is a term for a heart?s left pumping chamber that has thickened and may not be pumping efficiently.

Ventricular hypertrophy (VH) is thickening of the walls of a ventricle (lower chamber) of the heart.(1)(2) Although left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is more common, right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), as well as concurrent hypertrophy of both ventricles can also occur.\n[14] As enlargement progresses, though, the heart's pumping ability declines. Dilated cardiomyopathy is the main type of cardiomegaly. In dilated cardiomyopathy, the walls of both the left and right side of the heart (ventricles) become thin and stretched. The result is an enlarged heart. In the other types of enlarged heart, the heart's muscular left ventricle becomes abnormally thick. High blood pressure usually causes left ventricular enlargement (hypertrophy), while hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is an inherited condition.\n[15] What is Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)? Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a thickening (hypertrophy) of the muscles of the wall of the left ventricle of the heart causing the heart to be less able to relax between contractions. In some cases, this can lead to an increase in pressure in the left atrium which then enlarges.\n[16] Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common genetic cardiac disease, and occurs when there is marked left ventricular hypertrophy in the absence of inciting factors, such as hypertension.\n[17] Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is very common and can affect people of any age. It affects men and women equally. It is a common cause of sudden cardiac arrest in young people, including young athletes. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy occurs if heart muscle cells enlarge and cause the walls of the ventricles (usually the left ventricle) to thicken.\n[18] Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a complex type of heart disease that affects the heart muscle. It causes thickening of the heart muscle (especially the ventricles, or lower heart chambers), left ventricular stiffness, mitral valve changes and cellular changes.his type of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may be called hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). HCM also may cause thickening in other parts of the heart muscle, such as the bottom of the heart called the apex, right ventricle, or throughout the entire left ventricle.\n[19] Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can cause obstruction of blood as it exits the heart (left ventricle). This does not occur in all patients. A pressure gradient is generated between the heart and the aorta (the large blood vessel that the heart pumps blood into as it.\n[20] With hypertrophic obstructive. cardiomyopathy (HOCM), the muscle thickening restricts the flow of blood out of the heart. Often, leakage of the mitral. valve causes the blood in the lower chamber (left ventricle) to leak back into the upper chamber (left atrium).

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is defined as hypertrophy of the myocardium more than 1.5 cm, without an identifiable cause (Figure 1). Other causes of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, such as long-standing hypertension, amyloidosis, and aortic stenosis must first be excluded before HCM can be diagnosed.\n[4] Left ventricular hypertrophy usually develops gradually.

However, it is important to put this in context of the rest of the history and examination, and why the ECG was obtained in the first place; the ECG result should not be taken by itself.\n[9] Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a primary disease of the heart muscle (myocardium) characterised by hypertrophy (an increase in the thickness) of the left ventricle, associated with an overactive left ventricle and a small left ventricular chamber.ypertrophic Cardiomyopathy. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a disease of the heart muscle. It can cause sudden death, particularly in young, active men. Medicines can prevent a fatal outcome. Further research is being carried out in the search for better treatments.\n[10] Right ventricular hypertrophy is a form of ventricular hypertrophy affecting the right ventricle.

These diseases destroy blood vessels in the lung, causing increased pressure in the remaining vessels.\n[2] Ventricular hypertrophy can be part of various syndromes caused by any of various underlying diseases. For example, it can be a part of ventricular remodeling in consequence of ischemic heart disease or a component of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the absence of ischemia.\n[3] Left ventricular hypertrophy is more common in people who have uncontrolled high blood pressure. But no matter what your blood pressure is, developing left ventricular hypertrophy puts you at higher risk for a heart attack and stroke. Treating high blood pressure can help ease your symptoms and may reverse left ventricular hypertrophy.\n[4] See the Mayo Clinic webpage Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). It's the thickening of the muscle of the left ventricle, usually because pumping against a higher resistance (hypertension, aortic valve defects) or as part of a hereditary heart muscle disease (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). It's correlated with more heart failure, more heart attacks, more deaths.\n[5] If this happens, the condition is called obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Sometimes the septum, the wall that divides the left and right sides of the heart, thickens and bulges into the left ventricle. This can block blood flow out of the left ventricle. Then the ventricle must work hard to pump blood. Symptoms can include chest pain, dizziness, shortness of breath, or fainting. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy also can affect the heart's mitral valve, causing blood to leak backward through the valve.\n[6] Patient Information. Left Ventricular Hypertrophy on ECG. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) means that the muscle of the left pumping chamber of the heart (left ventricle) is thickened.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is typically an inherited condition.\n[8] High blood pressure forces your heart to work harder than necessary in order to pump blood to the rest of your body. This causes the left ventricle to thicken or stiffen (left ventricular hypertrophy). These changes limit the ventricle's ability to pump blood to your body.\n[9] The enlarged left ventricle can: Weaken; Stiffen and lose elasticity, preventing the chamber from filling properly and increasing pressure in the heart; Compress the chamber's blood vessels (coronary arteries) and restrict its supply of blood; As a result of these changes, complications of left ventricular hypertrophy include:\n[10] There are a few types of thickened left ventricle that can show up as LVH. Athletic hypertrophy occurs in highly trained athletes, such as marathon runners, as a natural result of their intense, sustained heart rate. However, LVH in athletes generally regresses when they return to normal activity levels.\n[11] Left ventricular hypertrophy is more common in people who have uncontrolled high blood pressure.

The heart may become weak and eventually suffer heart failure. slide 2 of 7. Causes of a Heart Thickened by a Narrowed Aorta In most patients, aortic stenosis is due to a congenital abnormality of the aortic valve.\n[5] As the heart pumps against elevated pressure in the blood vessels, the left ventricle becomes enlarged and the amount of blood pumped by the heart each minute (cardiac output) goes down, a condition called left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Without treatment, this can lead to heart failure.\n[6] The most common ventricular hypertrophy occurs on the left side, but a recent study published in the journal Circulation found that right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) is associated with an increased risk of heart failure and cardiovascular death in patients without clinically diagnosed heart disease at the start of the study.\n[7] Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a complex type of heart disease that affects the heart muscle. It causes thickening of the heart muscle (especially the ventricles, or lower heart chambers), left ventricular stiffness, mitral valve changes and cellular changes.tiffness in the left ventricle occurs as a result of cellular changes that occur in the heart muscle when it thickens. The left ventricle is unable to relax normally and fill with blood. Since there is less blood at the end of filling, there is less oxygen-rich blood pumped to the organs and muscles.\n[8] In this condition, the walls of the left and/or right ventricles of the heart become thin and stretched.

This is a disease affecting the ventricular septum. The ventricular septum, on the other hand, is the wall that divides the right and left ventricles of the heart. Symptoms of Right Ventricular Hypertrophy\n[2] High blood pressure may also bring on heart failure by causing left ventricular hypertrophy, a thickening of the heart muscle that results in less effective muscle relaxation between heart beats. This makes it difficult for the heart to fill with enough blood to supply the body's organs, especially during exercise, leading your body to hold onto fluids and your heart rate to increase.\n[3] Left ventricular hypertrophy that is caused by aortic valve stenosis might require surgery to repair the narrow valve or to replace it with an artificial or tissue valve. 1 Tests and diagnosis. 2 Lifestyle and home remedies.\n[4] Left ventricular hypertrophy that is caused by aortic valve stenosis might require surgery to repair the narrow valve or to replace it with an artificial or tissue valve. Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n[5] Over time, this can cause the heart muscle to thicken. As the heart pumps against elevated pressure in the blood vessels, the left ventricle becomes enlarged and the amount of blood pumped by the heart each minute (cardiac output) goes down, a condition called left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Without treatment, this can lead to heart failure.\n[6] Patients who present with a thickened left ventricle are likely suffering from left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). There are a few different causes of LVH. It is a strong indicator of potential coronary complications, and there is a strong correlation between certain types of LVH and morbidity and mortality.\n[7] Causes of Right Ventricular Hypertrophy. There are four usual causes of right ventricular hypertrophy. The first one is pulmonary hypertension. As stated earlier, pulmonary hypertension is a condition wherein the blood pressure increases in the pulmonary artery. And this can lead to shortness of breath, dizziness and fainting.\n[8] Left Ventricular Hypertrophy. Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH) causes a similar pattern of repolarization abnormalities as LBBB, with ST elevation in the leads with deep S-waves (usually V1-3) and ST depression/T-wave inversion in the leads with tall R waves (I, aVL, V5-6).\n[9] Hypertrophic heart disease is the abnormal thickening of the walls of the left ventricle. This can be congenital, related to valvular heart disease, autoimmune, or, most commonly, related to elevated blood pressure. The hypertrophy initially causes diastolic abnormalities. Because the thickened heart muscle is not as compliant as normal, the pressure inside the left ventricle may become elevated, and blood can back-up in the lungs.\n[10] Several underlying conditions can contribute to or influence the enlargement of the heart muscle in the left ventricle. Hypertension is the most common cause, setting the stage for left ventricular hypertrophy once a person's blood pressure exceeds the normal level of 140/90 mm Hg. Aside from hypertension, the condition known as aortic valve stenosis is also a common cause of the hypertrophic changes in the heart.\n[11] Factors that can cause your heart to work harder include: 1 High blood pressure (hypertension). This is the most common cause of left ventricular hypertrophy. More than one-third of people show evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy at the time of their diagnosis with hypertension. Aortic valve stenosis.\n[12] Left ventricular hypertrophy is more common in people who have uncontrolled high blood pressure. But no matter what your blood pressure is, developing left ventricular hypertrophy puts you at higher risk for a heart attack and stroke. Treating high blood pressure can help ease your symptoms and may reverse left ventricular hypertrophy.\n[13] Left ventricular hypertrophy: Related Topics.

Ventricular hypertrophy can be part of various syndromes caused by any of various underlying diseases.\n[15] Patient Information. Left Ventricular Hypertrophy on ECG. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) means that the muscle of the left pumping chamber of the heart (left ventricle) is thickened. The left ventricle's job is to pump blood to the body, and conditions that increase the work the left ventricle has to do can lead to thickening of the muscle.\n[16] What is Left Ventricular Hypertrophy? Left ventricular hypertrophy is a disorder of the heart involving the enlargement or thickening of the wall of cardiac muscle situated in the chamber of the heart known as the left ventricle.\n[17] Ventricular hypertrophy.

The result is an enlarged heart. In the other types of cardiomegaly, the heart's large muscular left ventricle becomes abnormally thick. Hypertrophy is usually what causes left ventricular enlargement.\n[19] High blood pressure forces your heart to work harder than necessary in order to pump blood to the rest of your body. This causes the left ventricle to thicken or stiffen (left ventricular hypertrophy).

LVH is often caused by high blood pressure or other heart problems and can lead to serious complications, such as heart disease, heart attack and heart failure.\n[2] By Mayo Clinic Staff. Left ventricular hypertrophy can occur when some factor makes your heart work harder than normal to pump blood to your body. Factors that can cause your heart to work harder include: High blood pressure (hypertension). This is the most common cause of left ventricular hypertrophy. More than one-third of people show evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy at the time of their diagnosis with hypertension.\n[3] Chamber Hypertrophy and Enlargment. In hypertrophy the heart muscle becomes thicker. This can have different causes. Left ventricular hypertrophy results from an increase in left ventricular workload, e.g., during hypertension or aortic valve stenosis. Right ventricular hypertrophy results from an increase in right ventricular workload, e.g., emphysema or pulmonary embolization. These causes are fundamentally different from hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HCM), which is a congenital misalignment of cardiomyocytes, resulting in hypertrophy.\n[4] Left ventricular hypertrophy can occur when some factor makes your heart work harder than normal to pump blood to your body.

More than one-third of people show evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy at the time of their diagnosis with hypertension. Aortic valve stenosis.\n[5] Left ventricular hypertrophy may cause or facilitate many cardiac complications of hypertension, including congestive heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and sudden death. Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, which may present with all of the symptoms and signs of congestive heart failure, is common in patients with long-standing hypertension.\n[6] Left ventricular hypertrophy can develop in response to some factor \u2014 such as high blood pressure or a heart condition \u2014 that causes the left ventricle to work harder. As the workload increases, the muscle tissue in the chamber wall thickens, and sometimes the size of the chamber itself also increases.\n[7] Left ventricular hypertrophy is a thickening of the wall of the heart's main pumping chamber. This thickening may result in elevation of pressure within the heart and sometimes poor pumping action.

The windpipe, also known as the trachea, is a part of the respiratory tract through which air passes from the nose or mouth to the lungs. It is membranous and flexible, but its walls contain a number of rings of cartilage that protect it from injury and collapse. The trachea is connected to the larynx above it, and below it are the primary bronchi, which branch from the windpipe to the lungs.\n[3] The larynx is composed of 3 large, unpaired cartilages (cricoid, thyroid, epiglottis); 3 pairs of smaller cartilages (arytenoids, corniculate, cuneiform); and a number of intrinsic muscles (see the image and video below). The hyoid bone, while technically not part of the larynx, provides muscular attachments from above that aid in laryngeal motion. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] Larynx anatomy.\n[4] 1b. The Trachea and Bronchi. The trachea or windpipe (Fig. 961) is a cartilaginous and membranous tube, extending from the lower part of the larynx, on a level with the sixth cervical vertebra, to the upper border of the fifth thoracic vertebra, where it divides into the two bronchi, one for each lung.\n[5] Trachea (Windpipe) The trachea (or windpipe) is a wide, hollow tube that connects the larynx (or voice box) to the bronchi of the lungs. It is an integral part of the body's airway and has the vital function of providing air flow to and from the lungs for respiration. The trachea begins at the inferior end of the larynx in the base of the neck.\n[6] The trachea terminates when it branches into two main bronchi. trachea (in vertebrates; also called windpipe) the main tube leading from the glottis in the neck to the point where the bronchia branch to the lungs. It consists of a fibrous pipe supported by C-shaped cartilage rings to prevent collapse when the head is turned.\n[7] The cricoid cartilage is the only complete ring of cartilage in the trachea. Below this there are from fifteen to twenty incomplete C-shaped tracheal rings of cartilage that reinforce the front and sides of the trachea to protect and maintain the airway.he epiglottis closes the opening to the larynx during swallowing. The trachea develops in the second month of development. It is lined with an epithelium that has goblet cells which produce protective mucins. An inflammatory condition, also involving the larynx and bronchi, called croup can result in a barking cough.\n[8] In adult humans, the larynx is found in the anterior neck at the level of the C3\u2013C6 vertebrae. It connects the inferior part of the pharynx (hypopharynx) with the trachea. The laryngeal skeleton consists of six cartilages: three single (epiglottic, thyroid and cricoid) and three paired (arytenoid, corniculate, and cuneiform). The hyoid bone is not part of the larynx, though the larynx is suspended from the hyoid.\n[9] The trachea, or windpipe (figs. 21-1 and 21-2), which has cervical and thoracic parts, extends from the inferior end of the larynx (C6 vertebra) to its point of bifurcation (between T5 and 7 vertebral level). It is about 9 to 15 cm in length.\n[10] Trachea. The trachea is a wide flexible tube, the lumen of which is kept open by 20 tracheal cartilages, which are C-shaped rings of hyaline cartilage. The gaps between the rings of cartilage are filled by the trachealis muscle-a bundle of smooth muscle, and fibroelastic tissue.he epithelium is either columnar or cuboidal. The final branches of the bronchioles are called terminal bronchioles. These have a layer smooth muscle surrounding their lumens. Stimulation of the vagus nerve (parasympathetic) causes the smooth muscle to contract, and reduce the diameter of the terminal bronchioles.\n[11] The trachea, or windpipe, is a 5-inch long tube made of C-shaped hyaline cartilage rings lined with pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium. The trachea connects the larynx to the bronchi and allows air to pass through the neck and into the thorax. The rings of cartilage making up the trachea allow it to remain open to air at all times.\n[12] Trachea.

The trachea extends from the larynx and branches into the two primary bronchi. At the top of the trachea the cricoid cartilage attaches it to the larynx.\n[19] 1 The trachea is a tube that runs from the bottom of the larynx into the chest where it divides into the bronchi, the tubes that go to each of the lungs. The thyroid gland lies in front of the trachea. The esophagus (foodpipe) lies behind it.\n[20] The trachea, commonly known as the windpipe, is a tube about 4 inches long and less than an inch in diameter in most people. The trachea begins just under the larynx (voice box) and runs down behind the breastbone (sternum). The trachea then divides into two smaller tubes called bronchi: one bronchus for each lung.

( 1 in vertebrates; also called windpipe) the main tube leading from the glottis in the neck to the point where the bronchia branch to the lungs. It consists of a fibrous pipe supported by C-shaped cartilage rings to prevent collapse when the head is turned.\n[5] The trachea (or windpipe) is a wide, hollow tube that connects the larynx (or voice box) to the bronchi of the lungs. It is an integral part of the body's airway and has the vital function of providing air flow to and from the lungs for respiration. The trachea begins at the inferior end of the larynx in the base of the neck.\n[6] The vocal folds are located within the larynx at the top of the trachea. They are attached posteriorly to the arytenoid cartilages, and anteriorly to the thyroid cartilage. They are part of the glottis which includes the rima glottidis.\n[7] In most plants, pitted tracheids function as the primary transport cells. The other type of tracheary element, besides the tracheid, is the vessel element. Vessel elements are joined by perforations into vessels. In vessels, water travels by bulk flow, as in a pipe, rather than by diffusion through cell membranes.t also allows plants to draw water from the root through the xylem to the leaf. Water is constantly lost through transpiration from the leaf. When one water molecule is lost another is pulled along by the processes of cohesion and tension.\n[8] Trachea. The trachea is a wide flexible tube, the lumen of which is kept open by 20 tracheal cartilages, which are C-shaped rings of hyaline cartilage. The gaps between the rings of cartilage are filled by the trachealis muscle-a bundle of smooth muscle, and fibroelastic tissue.espiratory | Trachea, bronchioles and bronchi. The conducting portion is made up of: nasal cavities, nasopharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchii and bronchioles. The trachea branches to give rise to two primary (main) bronchii.\n[9] The trachea is a flexible tube that extends from the larynx into the thorax. Its main function is to act as a conduit for air, but it also helps condition the inspired air. The trachea consists of four layers: a mucosa (epithelium and lamina propria), a submucosa, a fibrocartilage layer and an adventitia.\n[10] Best Answer: The trachea is the part of the human respiratory system that conducts the path of air from the external nasal cavity (nostrils) to the lungs.It is lined by 'C'- shaped cartilaginous rings that prevent it from collapsing.Before entering into the lungs, the trachea further divides into Bronchi and Bronchioles which eventually lead to the Alveoli where the exchange of gasses takes place.

This is the only complete ring, the others being incomplete rings of reinforcing cartilage. The trachealis muscle joins the ends of the rings and these are joined vertically by bands of fibrous connective tissue, the annular ligaments of trachea.The epiglottis closes the opening to the larynx during swallowing.The trachea develops in the second month of development.

It contains cartilaginous rings to hold open the airway. The trachea connects to the bronchi, which lead to each lung. The trachea is an important part of the respiratory system. Behind the trachea, is the esophagus--a muscular tube. It doesn't contain cartilaginous rings. However, the muscles are needed because peristalsis, a wavelike motion originates in the esophagus.\n[8] Trachea and esophagus are the tubular structures present in human body in neck region. They are very close to each other in respect to their location but their function differs. Trachea is a respiratory structure which transfers air entering the nose from environment to lungs whereas esophagus belong to digestive system which is called 'Gastrointestinal tract' and it transmits food and water to stomach.\n[9] It is part of the inside of your throat. The trachea is the tube that brings air into the lungs, commonly called the windpipe. The trachea is the rubbery tube that connects \u2026the nose and mouth to the lungs, and is an important part of the vertebrate respiratory system. When an individual breathes in, air flows into the lungs for respiration through the windpipe.\n[10] The trachea is the largest tube in the respiratory tract and consists of tracheal rings of hyaline cartilage. It branches off into two bronchial tubes, a left and a right main bronchus.

It is longer than a vessel element and has no perforation plates. Tracheids are elongated cells in the xylem of vascular plants that serve in the transport of water and mineral salts.Tracheids are one of two types of tracheary elements, vessel elements being the other. Tracheids, unlike vessel elements, do not have perforation plates.racheids provide most of the structural support in softwoods, where they are the major cell type. Because tracheids have a much higher surface to volume ratio compared to vessel elements, they serve to hold water against gravity (by adhesion) when transpiration is not occurring.\n[2] Tracheid. a dead lignified plant cell that functions in water conduction.

Spruce bark typically feels rough when you run your hand across it, with a thin and scaly look that grows more furrowed as the tree ages. Pine bark in general is smooth when the tree is young but with age often develops a reddish-brown color and starts to flake.\n[2] [t\u0250j\u02c8\u0261a] ; from Turkic) also known as boreal forest or snow forest, is a biome characterized by coniferous forests consisting mostly of pines, spruces and larches.

A very few species in four main genera are found: the evergreen spruce, fir and pine, and the deciduous larch. In North America, one or two species of fir and one or two species of spruce are dominant.\n[3] Picea sitchensis. Picea sitchensis, the Sitka spruce, is a large, coniferous, evergreen tree growing to almost 100 m (330 ft) tall, and with a trunk diameter at breast height that can exceed 5 m (16 ft) (see List of superlative trees).\n[4] The white spruce is a tree native to extreme northern parts of the United States and grows in much of Canada. The Norway spruce is an introduced species that hails from Europe.\n[5] Members of the Picea Genus. Spruce trees and shrubs are classified in the genus Picea, which includes 35 species. It is considered to be part of the Pinaceae family, which also includes pine trees, fir trees, cedars, hemlocks, larches and a few other species.n fact, you should be able to identify a spruce tree just by looking at its needles. Anoher notable characteristic for identification is that unlike the fascicles of pine trees, each pulvinus only holds one spruce needle. The pulvini are arranged in a whorl around the branch.\n[6] Examine the cones. The cones of a spruce tree are also a good way to identify the tree. Cones grow from tree branches and contain the seeds of a tree. Spruces, pines and firs all contain cones, as do other conifers like cedars and hemlock trees. Spruce cones have smooth, thin scales, and are quite flexible and easy to bend.\n[7] The cones are pendulous, slender cylindrical, 6\u201310 cm (2.4\u20133.9 in) long and 2 cm broad when closed, opening to 3 cm broad. They have thin, flexible scales 15\u201320 mm long; the bracts just above the scales are the longest of any spruce, occasionally just exserted and visible on the closed cones.\n[8] Firs are often distinguished from their spruce cousins through the characteristics of their needles. Those of spruce trees are rather firm and rectangular when cut in cross section, while fir-tree needles are softer, flatter, and two-sided. The cones of fir trees are erect and have scales that fall off in autumn.\n[9] While white spruce commonly forms pure stands within its geographical. growing range, it is also a major component of mixed stands. Common associates. to white spruce include: trembling aspen, white birch, balsam fir, tamarack, black. spruce, jack pine and lodgepole pine. On a national level, white spruce constitutes 26% of Canada's softwood growing. stock, and 20% of its total forest inventory. The species is acknowledged as one of. Alberta's most valuable commercial species.\n[10] The fungus is actually emerging from the stomata (natural pore-like openings) that occur in lines on all sides of a spruce needle. Green needles may show these small black fruiting structures. Keep in mind that environmental or site-related stresses can also cause discoloration and loss of needles on spruce trees.\n[11] Like fir trees, spruces have single needles connected to the stems. However, spruce tree needles are sharp and square-shaped. On a real tree, spruce needles easily break apart if you bend them. As a whole, spruce trees sport the traditional full Christmas tree shape, thanks to their upturned branches.\n[12] Examples are Pine, Fir, Spruce, Larch, Cedar and the Giant Redwood.

The species Norway Spruce originates from the mountains of central Europe, where it can be found at elevations as high as 6,000 ft. This cultivar, the Cupressina Norway Spruce, is fastigiate, meaning it is very narrow with a tight branching habit.Because of it's growth habit it's a prized selection on urban and suburban properties and in gardens where a strong, evergreen vertical element is required.Though it's classified as a dwarf, this conifer can be expected to grow to a height of 30'-40' in height and 8'-10' in diameter.ecause of it's growth habit it's a prized selection on urban and suburban properties and in gardens where a strong, evergreen vertical element is required.

The taiga is the world's largest terrestrial biome.lthough the taiga is dominated by coniferous forests, some broadleaf trees also occur, notably birch, aspen, willow, and rowan. Many smaller herbaceous plants, such as ferns and occasionally ramps grow closer to the ground.\n[6] The leaves of conifers are of course their needles. On true pine trees, the needles are arranged and attached to the branches in clusters of two (red pine group), three (yellow pine group), or five (white pine group) needles per cluster. Spruce and fir trees have their needles attached individually to the branches. To tell spruce and fir trees apart, it helps to know that spruce needles are sharply pointed, square and easy to roll between your fingers. Fir needles, on the other hand, are softer, flat and cannot be rolled between your fingers. Spruce needles are attached to small, stalk-like woody projections. When needles are shed, these projections remain. As a result, the branches of spruce trees feel rough.\n[7] Spruce is a verb that means you pay special attention to your personal appearance, especially your grooming and clothing.

Many, like these here, are permanently shaped by almost constant winds. Stripped tops of spruce trees are a sign of porcupine activity.\n[10] Spruce is easy to split, and catches fire easily. Spruce is a softwood, which means it seasons more quickly than hardwoods. Spruce does not produce high amounts of heat, but does produce a number of sparks, which is a safety concern.

Spruce Tree Types: List of Different Type of Spruce. Bird's Nest Spruce, dwarf variety of Norway Spruce.\n[19] Examine the cones. The cones of a spruce tree are also a good way to identify the tree. Cones grow from tree branches and contain the seeds of a tree. Spruces, pines and firs all contain cones, as do other conifers like cedars and hemlock trees. Spruce cones have smooth, thin scales, and are quite flexible and easy to bend.\n[20] Spruce and pine are virtually the same weight. In appearance, pine is amber to reddish brown, alternating with yellow and white, with occasional bold grain, or streaks of brown. Spruce is cream to white in color, with fine, consistently straight grain lines.\nSearch Query: what is physical description of spruce.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

State tree of Utah & Colorado.\n[19] The white spruce is a tree native to extreme northern parts of the United States and grows in much of Canada. The Norway spruce is an introduced species that hails from Europe. Both of these spruce trees are fashionable landscaping species planted extensively for their attributes.\n[20] The Caucasian spruce can live in a wide variety of soil types. It will need to be sheltered from winds. This tree works well as a specimen conifer. If you want one with yellow needles, look for the 'Skylands', 'Aureospicata' and 'Aurea' cultivars. 'Barnes' and 'Nana' are dwarf cultivars, while 'Gowdy' is columnar.n fact, you should be able to identify a spruce tree just by looking at its needles. Anoher notable characteristic for identification is that unlike the fascicles of pine trees, each pulvinus only holds one spruce needle. The pulvini are arranged in a whorl around the branch.\nSearch Query: what is physical description of spruce.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

To tell spruce and fir trees apart, it helps to know that spruce needles are sharply pointed, square and easy to roll between your fingers. Fir needles, on the other hand, are softer, flat and cannot be rolled between your fingers. Spruce needles are attached to small, stalk-like woody projections. When needles are shed, these projections remain. As a result, the branches of spruce trees feel rough.\n[13] Method 1 of 2: Distinguishing Spruces From Pines or Firs. 1. Look at the needles to identify spruce trees. 1 The needles of fir and spruce trees are attached to the branches individually, rather than in clusters. 2 Spruce needles are sharp, stiff and square, so they can be easily rolled between your fingers.\n[14] Like fir trees, spruces have single needles connected to the stems. However, spruce tree needles are sharp and square-shaped. On a real tree, spruce needles easily break apart if you bend them. As a whole, spruce trees sport the traditional full Christmas tree shape, thanks to their upturned branches.\n[15] Generally, they do, but look closer. Feel the needles. Spruces have stiff, prickly needles, while Douglas-firs and true firs have soft, flexible needles. Each spruce needle springs from a tiny, woody peg; in fact, this peg is one of the best ways to identify a spruce.\n[16] Spruces (Picea) 1 Spruce needles are generally stiff and sharp; about 1 long. 2 Each spruce needle springs from a tiny, woody peg. 3 Most spruce cones have papery thin scales. 4 Most spruce bark is thin and flaky.\n[17] 1 The tree has longer needles and cones than most Spruces and its wood has a reddish hue.

It coincides with the surface trace of the subduction fault marking the boundary between the converging plates.\n[6] Contribution[edit] Contribution margin is a measure of operating leverage: the higher the contribution margin is (the lower variable costs are as a percentage of total costs), the faster the profits increase with sales.\n[7] Free margin is the money that is not engaged in any trade and you can use it to take more positions. You remember what the margin or required margin was, right? Free margin is the difference of the equity and the required margin. In the above example, your position margin is $10. Let's say the equity is $1000.\n[8] While there are a few different kinds of profit margins, including \"gross profit margin,\" \"operating margin,\" (or operating profit margin) \"pretax profit margin\" and \"net margin\" (or net profit margin) the term \"profit margin\" is also often used simply to refer to net margin.\n[9] Operating margin. From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

It contains catalytic groups which are amino acids that promote formation and degradation of bonds.he three dimensional cleft is formed by the groups that come from different part of the amino acid sequences. The active site is only a small part of the total enzyme volume. It enhances the enzyme to bind to substrate and catalysis by many different weak interactions because of its nonpolar microenvironment.\n[13] What is 'Active Management'. Active management is the use of a human element, such as a single manager, co-managers or a team of managers, to actively manage a fund's portfolio.

With $100,000 in operating income on $420,000 in revenue, your operating margin is roughly 23.8 percent. Again, you would compare this to industry norms and previous periods.\n[19] The profit margin is a measure of the amount of profit accruing to a firm from the sale of a product or service. It also provides an indication of efficiency in that it captures the amount of surplus generated per unit of the product or service sold.ividing the dollar amount of earnings by the product cost, that firm's profit margin would be .10 or 10 percent, meaning that each dollar of sales generated an average of ten cents of profit.\n[20] The margin is the client's equity in the value of the portfolio or trading position.

Some plate margins exhibit features of more than one of the three main types and are known as combined plate margins. See PLATE TECTONICS; and SEA-FLOOR SPREADING.\n[2] The term margin, when used in accounting and financial reporting, refers to any of three profit lines on the income statement. A margin, specifically, is a profit figure expressed as a percentage of the company's net sales revenues.\n[3] What is 'Contribution Margin'. Contribution margin is a cost accounting concept that allows a company to determine the profitability of individual products. The phrase contribution margin can also refer to a per unit measure of a product's gross operating margin calculated simply as the product's price minus its total variable costs.\n[4] Convergent boundaries (Destructive) (or active margins) occur where two plates slide toward each other to form either a subduction zone (one plate moving underneath the other) or a continental collision.\n[5] Merchandise Margin. Merchandise margin is the amount or percentage of the profits earned after covering production costs. Production costs include the materials, labor and equipment used, but does not include other costs, such as administrative, marketing or leasing costs for equipment or space. These costs fall under a business' operating margin.\n[6] A Margin is a procedure allowing investors to borrow against their existing holdings to buy more securities. Usually the loan value is 100% of the account value. Thus the margin requirement, the amount needed in the account to keep it open is 50% of the value. In other words one can buy $20,000 worth of stock for $10,000.\n[7] The operating margin formula is calculated by dividing the operating income by the net sales during a period. Operating income, also called income from operations, is usually stated separately on the income statement before income from non-operating activities like interest and dividend income.\n[8] What is 'Net Interest Margin'. Net interest margin is a performance metric that examines how successful a firm's investment decisions are compared to its debt situations. A negative value denotes that the firm did not make an optimal decision, because interest expenses were greater than the amount of returns generated by investments.\n[9] A margin account is a loan account by a share trader with a broker which can be used for share trading. The funds available under the margin loan are determined by the broker based on the securities owned and provided by the trader, which act as collateral over the loan.he collateral for a margin account can be the cash deposited in the account or securities provided, and represents the funds available to the account holder for further share trading. On United States futures exchanges, margins were formerly called performance bonds.\n[10] In the income statement, there are four levels of profit or profit margins-gross profit, operating profit, pretax profit and net profit. The term margin can apply to the absolute number for a given profit level and/or the number as a percentage of net sales/revenues.he objective of margin analysis is to detect consistency or positive/negative trends in a company's earnings. Positive profit margin analysis translates into positive investment quality. To a large degree, it is the quality, and growth, of a company's earnings that drive its stock price.\n[11] 1 A Continental Margin is a boundary between continental crust and oceanic crust. 2 Active continental margins occur along plate boundaries, while passive continental margins occur at the boundary that marks a continent and the oceanic crust. 3 Mountain building takes place along active continental margins only.\n[12] In general, the continental shelves bordering active margins are narrower than those along passive margins.

However, it's important to take into consideration that average profit margins vary significantly between industries.perating margin is considered to be a good indicator of how efficiently a company manages expenses, because it reveals the amount of revenue returned to a company once it has covered virtually all of both its fixed and variable expenses except for taxes and interest.\n[2] the continental margin is the submerged outer edge of a continent it is generally divided into two sections the continental shelf and the continental slope the continental shelf is the region that extends seaward from the shoreline to a sharp drop off that marks the beginning of the continental slope continental margin that has a broad continental shelf a gentle continental slope and a pronounced continental rise is known as a passive continental margin this type of margin experiences little if any volcanic or earthquake activity the build up of sediment is the primary activity affecting a passive margin\n[3] Active and Passive Continental Margins [Part 2] - Duration: 15:15. worldethq 4,279 views\n[4] What is 'Contribution Margin' Contribution margin is a cost accounting concept that allows a company to determine the profitability of individual products. The phrase contribution margin can also refer to a per unit measure of a product's gross operating margin calculated simply as the product's price minus its total variable costs.\n[5] (PDB: 9LYZ \u200b). In biology, the active site is the region of an enzyme where substrate molecules bind and undergo a chemical reaction. The active site consists of residues that form temporary bonds with the substrate (binding site) and residues that catalyse a reaction of that substrate (catalytic site).\n[6] An active site is the part of an enzyme that directly binds to a substrate and carries a reaction. It contains catalytic groups which are amino acids that promote formation and degradation of bonds.\n[7] Lyle, it is confusing but operating margin is different from profit margin. Operating margin is what a company makes on each dollar of sales before interest and taxes. Profit margin is net income divided by revenue. So, Wal-Mart's operating margin is ~5.7% as you state, but its profit margin is ~3.37%.\n[8] \"Current + 1\" commercial strategy provides some margin stability.

It contains catalytic groups which are amino acids that promote formation and degradation of bonds. By forming and breaking these bonds, enzyme and substrate interaction promotes the formation of the transition state structure.\n[10] Passive Continental Margins-A passive continental margin occurs in the interior of plate, far away from any plate boundary.

Net interest margin is a performance metric that examines how successful a firm's investment decisions are compared to its debt situations. A negative value denotes that the firm did not make an optimal decision, because interest expenses were greater than the amount of returns generated by investments.\n[20] Gross manufacturing margin, also called gross profit margin or the gross margin, represents the total amount of income your company keeps after paying the direct costs related to the manufacturing of products sold. It is critical for a company to have a generous operating margin to pay its fixed costs, such as the interest payments on debt.\nSearch Query: what is a active margin.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Generally speaking, the higher a company's operating margin is, the better off the company is. If a company's margin is increasing, it is earning more per dollar of sales.\n[3] Active management. Active management (also called active investing) refers to a portfolio management strategy where the manager makes specific investments with the goal of outperforming an investment benchmark index. In passive management, investors expect a return that closely replicates the investment weighting and returns of a benchmark index and will often invest in an index fund\n[4] Contribution margin is the intermediate profit that appears on variable costing income statement, while gross profit margin, which equal sales minus all product costs (direct materials, direct labor and manufacturing overheads), appears on absorption costing income statement.\n[5] A passive-active cell is the concentration cell series where metals rely on an ultra-bonded passive film (typically an oxide) for protection against corrosion. Mainly, salts that accumulate on the metal substrate will have the film broken with water. In turn, the active metal that is underneath the existing film will be open to corrosion. This will result in an electrical potential and this will exist in the cathode area, or the passive film, and the anode, or smaller area, referred to as active metal. Thus, rapid pitting of the active metal will result.\n[6] Contribution margin is a measure of operating leverage: the higher the contribution margin is (the lower variable costs are as a percentage of total costs), the faster the profits increase with sales.\n[7] Although they are the trailing edge of the continents, passive continental margins currently exist in the middle of plates, not at plate boundaries. Erosion is the primary force acting on them, having continually deposited sediment from dry land since their formation.\n[8] The profit margin is a measure of the amount of profit accruing to a firm from the sale of a product or service. It also provides an indication of efficiency in that it captures the amount of surplus generated per unit of the product or service sold.\n[9] While there are a few different kinds of profit margins, including \" gross profit margin ,\" \" operating margin ,\" (or operating profit margin) \" pretax profit margin \" and \" net margin \" (or net profit margin) the term \"profit margin\" is also often used simply to refer to net margin.\n[10] A: Operating margin and profit margin both measure the efficiency of a firm by comparing profits against costs at three different spots on an income statement. On their own, these margins do not tell much of a story, but they are very useful when compared to past periods or to competitor firms in the same industry.\n[11] 1 A Continental Margin is a boundary between continental crust and oceanic crust. 2 Active continental margins occur along plate boundaries, while passive continental margins occur at the boundary that marks a continent and the oceanic crust. 3 Mountain building takes place along active continental margins only.\n[12] In general, the continental shelves bordering active margins are narrower than those along passive margins.

This type of margin experiences little, if any, volcanic or earthquake activity. The build-up of sediment is the primary activity affecting a passive margin.he continental shelf is the region that extends seaward from the shoreline to a sharp drop-off that marks the beginning of the continental slope. That drop-off is known as the continental shelf break. Continental shelves vary in width from 3 to 930 miles (5 to 1,500 kilometers).\n[2] Operating margin is the percentage of revenue that a company generates that can be used to pay the company's investors (both equity investors and debt investors) and the tax man. It is a key measure in analyzing a stock's value. Other things being equal, the higher the operating margin, the better. Using a percentage figure is also very useful for comparing companies against or analyzing the operating results of one company over various revenue scenarios.\n[3] passive continental margins currently exist in the middle of plates, not at plate boundaries. active continental margins form primarily along the boundaries of plates that are actively converging and where one plate is sinking beneath the other. Elizabeth H \u00b7 6 years ago. Thumbs up.\n[4] The operating margin (also called the operating profit margin or return on sales) is a ratio that shines a light on how much money a company is actually making in profit. It is found by dividing operating income by revenue, where operating income is revenue minus operating expenses .\n[5] Active Margins. occur where oceanic lithosphere is being subducted beneath the edge of the continent. the result is a relatively narrow margin that consists of highly deformed sediment that was scraped from the decending lithospheric slab and plastered against the margin of the overriding continent.ame thing as oceanic ridge. Long well developed divergent plate boundary, sea floor is elevated forming a broad line swell called the ocean ridge. knowledge of the ridge comes from soundings of the ocean floor and floor samples from deep sea drilling, visual inspections from deep submersibles.\n[6] What it is: Operating margin is a measure of profitability. It indicates how much of each dollar of revenues is left over after both costs of goods sold and operating expenses are considered. The formula is for calculating operating margin is: Operating Margin = Operating Earnings / Revenue.\n[7] Contribution margin. In cost-volume-profit analysis, a form of management accounting, contribution margin\u2014the marginal profit per unit sale\u2014is a useful quantity in carrying out various calculations, and can be used as a measure of operating leverage. Typically, low contribution margins are prevalent in the labor-intensive tertiary sector while high contribution margins are prevalent in the capital-intensive industrial sector.\n[8] Margin in business is expressed as a ratio of the difference between what it costs to produce a good or service and the amount of payment received for that good or service. Operating margin illustrates a company's operating efficiency in relation to its net sales.\n[9] Operating margin or operating profit margin measures what proportion of a company's revenue is left over, after deducting direct costs and overhead and before taxes and other indirect costs such as interest.

Very little volcanic or earthquake activity is associated with passive margins. (b) active or leading margins: plate boundary located along a continental margin \u2013 ocean trenches where there is subduction of oceanic lithosphere \u2013 narrow, steep, with volcanic mountains (West Coast of the Americas). Active margins are the site of volcanic and earthquake activity. 12 Continental Margins\n[3] The North American plate also serves to illustrate this difference. The west coast is the active margin, and is the location of earthquakes, volcanoes, and mountains. The Eastern Seaboard is a passive margin, as is the Gulf Coast. These are the low-relief areas of our continent, and are the locations of such exciting places as New Jersey, the Barrier Islands, the swamps of Florida, and the Mississippi delta.\n[4] Operating margin indicates what proportion of a company's revenue (income) remains after variable production costs are paid, such as workers' wages and raw materials. If your company makes a product that costs $10 to produce and it sells for $15, the operating margin is $5.\n[5] What is an 'Operating Margin' Operating margin is a margin ratio used to measure a company's pricing strategy and operating efficiency. Operating margin is a measurement of what proportion of a company's revenue is left over after paying for variable costs of production such as wages, raw materials, etc.\n[6] \" The operating margin was an especially useful metric or ratio during the meeting as we wanted the discussion to include revenue statistics.\n[7] Both passive and active continental margins are located near coastlines. The main difference is that active margins are the main sites where tectonic activity takes place (lik \u2026 e earthquakes). This is because the continental shelf of active continental margins collide with an oceanic plate, creating subduction.\n[8] The continental margins along India and Antarctica are other examples of passive margins. A continental margin that has a very narrow, or even nonexistent, continental shelf and a narrow and steep continental slope is known as an active continental margin. Instead of ending in a continental rise, the continental slope of this type of margin often plunges into a deep-ocean trench, which may be filled with sediment.\n[9] Passive plate margins endure very little constructive or destructive movement. Active plate margins describe subduction zones and other boundaries where movement is regular and common.

If your company makes a product that costs $10 to produce and it sells for $15, the operating margin is $5. The difference between operating margin and gross manufacturing margin is that the operating margin presents a picture of how much your business makes on every dollar of sale before tax and interest.\n[11] 1 A Continental Margin is a boundary between continental crust and oceanic crust. 2 Active continental margins occur along plate boundaries, while passive continental margins occur at the boundary that marks a continent and the oceanic crust. 3 Mountain building takes place along active continental margins only.\n[12] Cases of continental margins that are on or very close to a plate margin.

As you probably know the theory of plate tectonics posits the outer layer of the Earth consist of plates which move relative to each other driven by convection in the Mantle.\n[2] Active continental margin: A continental margin that has a very narrow, or even nonexistent, continental shelf and a narrow and steep continental slope that ends in a deep trench instead of a continental rise; it is marked by earthquake and volcanic activity.\n[3] An active continental margin refers to the submerged edge of a continent overriding an oceanic lithosphere at a convergent plate boundary by opposition with a passive continental margin which is the remaining scar at the edge of a continent following continental break-up.\n[4] The overall rate may be extremely slow (one to ten centimeters per year), but the long term effect is a continual re-shaping of the surface of our planet. An active continental margin is found on the leading edge of the continent where it is crashing into an oceanic plate. An excellent example is the west coast of South America. Active margins are commonly the sites of tectonic activity: earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain building, and the formation of new igneous rock.\n[5] An active continental margin is found on the leading edge of the continent where it is crashing into an oceanic plate.

Active plate margins are often the site of earthquakes and volcanoes. Oceanic crust created by seafloor spreading in the East Pacific Rise, for instance, may become part of the Ring of Fire, the horseshoe-shaped pattern of volcanoes and earthquake zones around the Pacific ocean basin.\n[9] Two types of continental margins exist: active margins and passive margins. Active margins form primarily along the boundaries of plates that are actively converging. Passive margins currently exist in the middle of plates, not at plate boundaries.\n[10] Passive margin. A passive margin is the transition between oceanic and continental lithosphere that is not an active plate margin. A passive margin forms by sedimentation above an ancient rift, now marked by transitional lithosphere.

It increases the amount and variety of life in and on the soil, including disease-causing organisms and disease suppression organisms. The most powerful benefit of no-tillage is improvement in soil biological fertility, making soils more resilient.\n[3] To prevent insect damage to developing fruits, place melons on pots or pieces of wood. If growing melons on a trellis, support fruit with slings made from netting, fabric, or pantyhose. Trellising improves air circulation around plants and can help reduce foliar disease problems.\n[4] Plowing allows water and air to enter the soil, it also allows humus (organic matter) to be plowed into the soil so that earthworms can have access to.\n[5] Sustainable land use can help to reduce the impacts of agriculture and livestock, preventing soil degradation and erosion and the loss of valuable land to desertification.\n[6] Non-surgical contouring treatment that freezes stubborn fat, which then is naturally eliminated from your body, shaping up the areas you can't conquer with diet and exercise alone.\n[7] \"Freezing and thawing significantly decreased the penetration resistance in compacted soils,\" says Jabro. Soil at 0-10 cm depth showed the most change after FTCs, with a 73% reduction in penetration resistance.\n[8] Cultivator teeth work near the surface, usually for weed control, whereas chisel plow shanks work deep beneath the surface, breaking up hardpan. Consequently, cultivating also takes much less power per shank than does chisel plowing.mall tilling equipment, used in small gardens such as household gardens and small commercial gardens, can provide both primary and secondary tillage. For example, a rotary tiller does both the plowing and the harrowing, preparing a smooth, loose seedbed.\n[9] Domestic livestock grazing reduces wildlife populations by competing for food, water, and space, and degrading habitat. Habitat degradation caused by grazing also exposes prey species to increased predation (due to lost vegetative cover for concealment and escape), resulting in further declines in those populations.\n[10] Cycle 1 contour foods are fish, apples and pears, olive oil, and yogurt. 1 Lean proteins \u2013 no limits *Fish: salmon, canned or fresh; sole; flounder; catfish; tilapia; canned light tuna in water. 2 Eggs \u2013 up to 2 a day Eggs (2 eggs = 1 serving). 3 Cleansing vegetables \u2013 no limits.\n[11] 1 Cutting the weeds (using sharp-bladed farm implements) before flowering, can reduce their population. 2 Hand weeding of seedlings-it is difficult to do handweeding once the plant is mature and well-established due to its rough root system. 3 Mulching (2-3 inches layer mulch) prevents the seeds from germinating.\n[12] 1 Surgery - Plastic and cosmetic. 2 Body contouring is a type of surgery that may be carried out after major weight loss. 3 The surgery removes sagging skin and extra fat and improves the shape and tone of underlying tissue.

Body contouring will not stop your skin from sagging if you gain and lose a large amount of weight in the future.\n[14] Cosmetic contouring is a conservative procedure to improve the appearance of fractured, worn or irregular teeth.sing a polishing instrument, the cosmetic dentist removes small amounts of enamel to contour the tooth. This technique is most useful in cases of slight to moderate overlapping of the front teeth, slight rotation of the front teeth, uneven wear, or teeth that don't have their biting and incising edges in harmony.\n[15] The benefits of mulching with these organic materials discourages weeds and garden pests, conserves moisture in the soil, keeps dust from blowing around, dresses up the beds with texture and color, improves topsoil as it breaks down, and it is a layer of protection for plants against weather.\n[16] One of the best ways to prevent soil erosion is to increase vegetation, which locks in the soil particles and breaks up damaging winds. Terracing is an option for controlling erosion on sloped land by cutting in flat surfaces.\n[17] Raking can't be avoided, because this process gathers a mowed swath into a windrow or gathers two or more windrows into one for more efficient baling. By creating windrows that are uniform in width and in the amount of hay they contain, producers help ensure bales are consistent in shape and density.\n[18] A parabolic shape is preferred because it is the shape found most often in natural waterways, it is the most crossing-friendly shape to farm equipment, and the flow of water is less likely to meander. To avoid causing gullies alongside the waterway, don't plant endrows that run parallel to the waterway.owing waterways is also important. Allowing the grass to mature means too much sediment will be trapped. The waterway could lose its shape, or the water will simply circumvent the waterway altogether. To allow for bird nesting, be sure that any mowing occurs before May 10 and after July 15.\n[19] Botox\u00ae Jaw line Contouring / Face Slimming.

For inthrow and outthrow plowing, plow bottoms that turn the soil to the right are mounted on the plow frames. Flat plowing is done with reversible, pickup, and shuttle plows.\n[3] Teeth contouring is a great option for patients who want to correct minor imperfections, such as teeth that are too long, slightly overlapping teeth, teeth with jagged edges, and more. What is Teeth Contouring? Teeth contouring is the process of gently polishing away a minimal portion of your tooth enamel to adjust the shape or texture of your teeth. Teeth contouring is an affordable cosmetic dentistry treatment where small changes can make a big difference. Teeth contouring is gentle, safe and minimally invasive.\n[4] Best Answer: 5) Which is the best way to prevent soil erosion on a farm? a) Plow fields along contour lines. 6) Freshwater is usually considered a renewable resource.

Without the root structure to hole the soil in place it can wash or blow away. Agriculture causes erosion by overgrazing and plowing remove a lower ground cover. Plowing with the furrows up and down slopes can make erosion worse than plowing along the slope.\n[8] The soil is turned by plowing and scuffling. Tillage also involves breaking up, or crumbling, large masses of soil into small clumps, which increase the porosity and aeration of the soil. As a result, biological activity is intensified, and plant nutrients are accumulated.\n[9] Professionals in today's world are becoming increasingly conscious of their body image. Body contouring and fat reduction treatments provide a way to deal with issues of cellulite as well as skin laxity.

If you need to lengthen teeth, widen teeth or fill in cracks, then teeth bonding may be a more appropriate choice.\n[3] Wood Shavings. White wood shavings (dust extracted, not sawdust) is one of the most popular bedding materials for chickens, ducks and other poultry as they are relatively cheap, very absorbent and easy to use.Shavings keep smells down and reduce ammonia in the air from droppings that can cause respiratory damage and eye problems.t is best to use straw in nest boxes and not for bedding. I would only consider using straw if I had a plentiful / cheap supply of it. Chopped straw is the most convenient to use. A major advantage is that it will compost quickly.\n[4] Reducing the velocity of water moving across the soil surface will reduce water erosion. This may be accomplished by using strip cropping. In strip cropping a row crop such as corn is planted in strips that alternate with strips of a forage crop such as alfalfa or grass hay.\n[5] Neck contouring creates a firmer, smoother and more refined appearance to the neck and chin. Even without making any other changes to the face, improving a thick, wrinkled or sagging neck can dramatically improve a one's appearance, helping a patient look years younger or even as though he or she has lost weight.hrough neck contouring surgery, a cosmetic surgeon can help patients of any age achieve the naturally beautiful neckline they desire.

Many farmers spread manure from cattle and swine onto their fields. This manure is rich in nitrogen which is essential for plant growth.\n[8] The plough represents one of the major advances in agriculture. The primary purpose of ploughing is to turn over the upper layer of the soil, bringing fresh nutrients to the surface, while burying weeds and the remains of previous crops and allowing them to break down.As the plough is drawn through the soil it creates long trenches of fertile soil called furrows.In modern use, a ploughed field is typically left to dry out, and is then harrowed before planting.se of the plough has decreased in some areas, often those significantly threatened by soil damage and erosion, in favour of shallower ploughing and other less invasive conservation tillage techniques.\n[9] Chopping or mowing. your materials makes the process go faster. Food scraps should be added to the center of the waste layers where heat will be the greatest. This also. reduces unwanted critters coming to your compost pile. Pile material loosely in the bin. Too much compaction inhibits the flow of air through the pile.\n[10] The correct concavity and angling eliminates the deep furrows. The disc harrow, like the plow, must have a range of varied depths, or it would be of little value. The disc blade is to the harrow what the plow bottom is to the moldboard plow \u2014 it is the business or working end of the tool.

Tillage also involves breaking up, or crumbling, large masses of soil into small clumps, which increase the porosity and aeration of the soil. As a result, biological activity is intensified, and plant nutrients are accumulated.\n[18] Humans can cause erosion by clean cutting trees and brush. Without the root structure to hole the soil in place it can wash or blow away. Agriculture causes erosion by overgrazing and plowing remove a lower ground cover. Plowing with the furrows up and down slopes can make erosion worse than plowing along the slope.\n[19] Sustainable land use can help to reduce the impacts of agriculture and livestock, preventing soil degradation and erosion and the loss of valuable land to desertification.\n[20] The benefits of mulching with these organic materials discourages weeds and garden pests, conserves moisture in the soil, keeps dust from blowing around, dresses up the beds with texture and color, improves topsoil as it breaks down, and it is a layer of protection for plants against weather.\nSearch Query: what can contour plowing reduce.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Plowing allows water and air to enter the soil, it also allows humus (organic matter) to be plowed into the soil so that earthworms can have access to it and improve soil quality. Plowing does disturb the soil and can make it susceptible to erosion due to wind taking loose soil or water erosion when it rains. Leaving soil exposed without a crop in it means that erosion can occur.\n[2] Conservation tillage can be an economical option for farmers, plus provides a number of potential environmental benefits: 1 Reduced plowing makes cropland much less vulnerable to soil erosion: conservation tillage reduces soil erosion by as much as 90 percent, compared to systems using intensive tillage.\n[3] Plowing and planting across the changing slope of land, rather than in straight lines, to help retain water and reduce soil erosion. Method for reducing soil erosion; plant stalks are left in the field after harvesting and the next year's crop is planted within the stalks without plowing.\n[4] However, when the compacted layer is tilled with a moldboard or chisel plow, the resulting rough, cloddy surface can decrease runoff and erosion. While it sounds contradictory, both effects are possible, depending on the soil and soil conditions encountered.\n[5] Best Answer: The benefits of plowing are primarily weed control, turning under crop residues so that it breaks down faster, and preparing a good clean area for planting seed. These same benefits of the plow have been shown over the years to have a negative effect on the soil environment. The plow is quickly becoming an implement of the past.\n[6] The objective of tillage (mechanical manipulation of the soil) is to improve tilth, thereby increasing crop production; in the long term, however, conventional tillage, especially plowing, often has the opposite effect, causing the soil to break down and become compacted.\n[7] Intensive relay cropping will give your soil a work out, but because of the sub-acre scale of SPIN-Farming, it is much easier to keep your soil healthy, and at a reasonable cost. You can use your rototiller to plow in compost, and individual beds can be amended on a case-by-case basis.\n[8] 2. Use terrace farming. This type of farming uses the topography of the land to slow water flow through a series of terraces. This manipulation of the water flow prevents it from gathering speed and washing soil away from farmlands. 3. Practice contour farming. Contour farming replicates the effects of terrace farming, but on a smaller scale.\n[9] Use of the plough has decreased in some areas, often those significantly threatened by soil damage and erosion, in favour of shallower ploughing and other less invasive conservation tillage techniques.\n[10] With conventional tillage (complete turning over of the soil), the bare soil is exposed to the erosive action of water, which, in many areas is the major route of soil loss.

Both are used to reduce soil erosion from tilled fields on slopes. In terrace farming, physical barriers (trenches, stone bunds, live hedges, or natural strips) are created along the contours to retain rain water and make it infiltrate into the soil and to minimize soil erosion.\n[3] Tilling the field at right angles to the natural slope after drawing up the elevation contour lines is called contour ploughing in soil, prevents and reduces soil erosion. Terrace Farming In terracing, wide steps are cut around the slopes of hills to prevent soil erosion. Contour ploughing follows the \"natural shape\" of the slope without altering it. Terrace farming alters the shape of the slope to produce flat areas that provide a catchment for water.\n[4] One of the earliest methods of conservation tillage came to be known as contour plowing, or plowing on the contour. Tilling the soil along the gentle slopes of a piece of cropland, instead of up and down the gradient, prevents fertile topsoil from being carried downhill by flowing rainwater.\n[5] Safeopedia explains Contour Plowing. Contour farming is done in hilly and sloped areas. Farmers who practice contour farming start by cutting levels into the hill or contoured area. This creates a series of steps on the hill on which crops are grown.\n[6] Contour Plowing & Terraces The Soil Erosion Service was one of the federal programs started in the 1930s to save the land that had been destroyed by years of wind erosion, over plowing, and over grazing. The commission taught farmers how to use terracing and contour plowing techniques to preserve the soil.\n[7] In contour ploughing, the ruts made by the plow run perpendicular rather than parallel to slopes, generally resulting in furrows that curve around the land and are level. This method is also known for preventing tillage erosion. Tillage erosion is the soil movement and erosion by tilling a given plot of land. A similar practice is contour bunding where stones are placed around the contours of slopes.\n[8] Contour plowing is also promoted in countries with similar rainfall patterns to the United States such as western Canada and Australia. The practice is effective only on slopes with between 2% and 10% gradient and when rainfall does not exceed a certain amount within a certain period.\n[9] Definition of contour plowing in US English - plowing along the contours of the land in order to minimize soil erosion.

The plow follows the contours of the land horizontally helping to reduce runoff of water. This practice helps to prevent soil erosion in hilly and contoured areas by capturing the water runoff using water breaks to keep water contained. Contour plowing is also known as contour farming, and is a sustainable form of agriculture.\n[2] 2016-09-28T08:13:26-04:00. Farmers can reduce soil erosion by contour plowing. The correct option among all the options that are given in the question is the second option or option B. The other choices given in the question are incorrect and can be neglected. I hope that this is the answer that has actually come to your desired help.\n[3] In contour plowing, the land is plowed across the slopes and along the contour lines. This will also reduce soil erosion and make rainwater infiltrate into the soil more than on land plowed along the slope. Terraces are more effective than contour plowing alone in minimizing soil erosion and facilitating infiltration f rainfall into the soil.\n[4] Contour plowing Contour ploughing or contour farming is the farming practice of ploughing and/or planting across a slope following its elevation contour lines. These contour lines create a water break which reduces the formation of rills and gullies during times of heavy water run-off; which is a major cause of top soil loss and soil erosion.\n[5] A: Contour plowing conserves soil by following the lay of the land and creating ridges that form a water break to prevent soil erosion. Furrows that do not follow the lay of the land cause rapid runoff during rainfall by forming a convenient channel for the water to flow downhill.\n[6] Contour plowing.

Legionnaires' disease most often is caused by inhaling water contaminated with rod-shaped bacteria called Legionella pneumophila. There are over 30 different species of Legionella, many of which can cause disease. Legionella pneumophila is the most common species that causes disease.egionellosis is a common name for one of the several illnesses caused by Legionnaires' disease bacteria (LDB). Legionnaires' disease is an infection of the lungs that is a form of pneumonia.\n[2] Other bacteria types that can cause pneumonia include the bacteria that cause so-called atypical pneumonia, Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumonia. The most common cause of viral pneumonia in adults is the influenza virus. A number of different respiratory viruses cause pneumonia in children, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). While viral pneumonia tends to be less severe than bacterial pneumonia, there is a risk of developing secondary bacterial pneumonia when viral pneumonia is present.\n[3] 1 The most common cause of bacterial pneumonia is a type of bacteria known as Streptococcus pneumoniae. 2 Haemophilus influenzae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila are some other major bacteria that cause pneumonia. The body's immune system usually keeps bacteria from infecting the lungs. 2 In bacterial pneumonia, bacteria reproduce in the lungs, while the body tries to fight off the infection. 3 This response to bacterial invaders is called inflammation.\n[4] Pneumonia caused by Legionella may occur with abdominal pain, diarrhea, or confusion, while pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae is associated with rusty colored sputum, and pneumonia caused by Klebsiella may have bloody sputum often described as currant jelly.\n[5] The answer. The pathogens causing atypical pneumonia include: Mycoplasma pneumonia. Chlamydia psittaci. Chlamydia pneumonia. Coxiella burnetii. Francisella tularensis. Legionella pneumophila. Viruses including influenza A and B, parainfluenza, adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus.\n[6] Legionella is a type of bacteria that can cause a serious form of pneumonia called Legionnaires disease. Legionella testing detects the presence of the bacteria to help diagnose the cause of a person's pneumonia. legionella infection affects the lower respiratory tract, often requires hospitalization, and has a significant mortality rate. In addition to pneumonia, Legionella bacteria can also cause Pontiac fever, a milder and self-limiting illness with flu-like symptoms.\n[7] Legionnaires' disease is a form of atypical pneumonia caused by any type of Legionella bacteria. Signs and symptoms include cough, shortness of breath, high fever, muscle pains, and headaches. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may also occur. This often begins two to ten days after being exposed.\n[8] Atypical organisms such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila are implicated in up to 40 percent of cases of community-acquired pneumonia. Antibiotic treatment is empiric and includes coverage for both typical and atypical organisms.\n[9] Deadly: A conceptual image of Legionella Pneumophila bacteria, which causes Legionnaires' Disease.

The body's immune system usually keeps bacteria from infecting the lungs. 2 In bacterial pneumonia, bacteria reproduce in the lungs, while the body tries to fight off the infection. 3 This response to bacterial invaders is called inflammation.\n[19] Atypical organisms such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila are implicated in up to 40 percent of cases of community-acquired pneumonia. Antibiotic treatment is empiric and includes coverage for both typical and atypical organisms.\n[20] It may be readily visualized with a silver stain. Legionella is common in many environments, including soil and aquatic systems, with at least 50 species and 70 serogroups identified.

Other bacteria can cause pneumonia, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila (Chlamydia) pneumoniae, Chlamydophila (Chlamydia) psittaci, and Legionella pneumophila. This illness, caused by Chlamydophila (or Chlamydia) pneumoniae, is most common in school-aged children and usually develops into mild pneumonia or bronchitis\u2026. 2 Legionnaires' Disease. 3 Legionella pneumophila causes more than 90% of outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease, a severe form of pneumonia\u2026.\n[2] Legionnaires' Disease is a severe form of pneumonia that sickens about 5,000 people in the U.S. each year. It's caused by the bacterium Legionella pneumophila. Scientists first identified it in 1977.\n[3] Several types of bacteria, including Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae, cause atypical pneumonia. It is sometimes called walking pneumonia and is referred to as atypical because its symptoms differ from those of other types of bacterial pneumonia.\n[4] Legionnaires' disease is a severe, often lethal, form of pneumonia. It's caused by the bacterium Legionella pneumophila found in both potable and nonpotable water systems. Each year, an estimated 10,000 to 18,000 people are infected with the Legionella bacteria in the United States.\n[5] 1 Atypical pneumonia is caused by bacteria such as Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. Other bacteria that can cause pneumonia include Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Neisseria meningitidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae.\n[6] Pneumonia is an infection of the lung. With atypical pneumonia, the infection is caused by different bacteria than the ones that cause typical pneumonia. These include Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. Atypical pneumonia also tends to have milder symptoms than typical pneumonia.\n[7] : pneumonia that is caused by a bacterium of the genus Legionella (L. pneumophila), that is characterized initially by symptoms resembling influenza (as malaise, headache, and muscular aches) followed by high fever, cough, diarrhea, lobar pneumonia, and mental confusion, and that may be fatal especially in elderly and immunocompromised ...\n[8] Pneumonia due to mycoplasma and chlamydophila bacteria is usually mild. 1 Pneumonia due to Legionella pneumophila gets worse during the first 4 to 6 days, and then improves over 4 to 5 days.

While the sinking of the Lusitania is the most common excuse for why.\n[7] For other uses, see World War One (disambiguation) and Great War (disambiguation). World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, the Great War, or the War to End All Wars, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history.\n[8] Isolationist foreign policy was encouraged by Congress's apprehensions about giving other countries a political door into US policies and the cultural melting pot of the United States' population. In spite of these factors, the United States did enter World War I, as a result of several events.In an attempt by both the allied and the central powers to involve the Americans, the US was heavily saturated with propaganda.uch of the material had a Pro-British slant which was aided by the connection to Britain as a cultural brother and the United States' concern with affairs in Western Europe. While propaganda sympathetic to Germany did also exist, it did not carry much weight with the American public.\n[9] Europe first, also known as Germany first, was the key element of the grand strategy agreed upon by the United States and the United Kingdom during World War II.ccording to this policy, the United States and the United Kingdom would use the preponderance of their resources to subdue Nazi Germany in Europe first.

As a result, the level of confusion was high in the first 12 months, then efficiency took control.n the general public, there was little support for entering the war on the side of Germany. The great majority of German Americans, as well as Scandinavian Americans, wanted the United States to remain neutral; however, at the outbreak of war thousands of US citizens had tried to enlist in the German army.\n[11] Causes of the war. There was no single event that caused World War One (WWI). War happened because of several different events that took place in the years building up to 1914. Firstly, there was the role of empire.Great Britain, Germany, Austria-Hungary and Russia all had empires.This meant that they ruled many countries all over the world.ar happened because of several different events that took place in the years building up to 1914.

This meant that they ruled many countries all over the world.\n[12] Since the beginning of World War I in 1914, the United States, under President Woodrow Wilson, had maintained strict neutrality, other than providing material assistance to the Allies.he United States entered World War 1 when they had a note given to them from the British that was from Germany. It was a note to Mexico, called the Zimmerman Note. Germany promised Mexico the land that America took from them earlier (like Texas and Arizona) if they helped Germany win the war.\n[13] In the beginning of World war I, The U.S should have not been involved with the war in the first place. It was not needed for the U.S to interfere with Germany, Russia, and Britain during the war. The reason being, the Russians were beating the German army rapidly. They did not need any help at the time.\n[14] To this day, most observers continue to claim that World War I was an inadvertent war: that is, that none of the countries involved particularly wanted war but war came nonetheless. Some claim it was the major armament programs and offensive military doctrines adopted by European countries in the run-up to the war that made WWI inevitable. Others claim it was the hypernationalistic populaces that caused the war.\n[15] Posted on June 2, 2012 at 1:17 PM.

This assassination triggered declarations of war. Firstly, this gave Austria a reason to attack Serbia.\n[17] World War I began in 1914 and America entered the war in 1917 and that caused a labor shortage among men and women who had to and did take over. First, the government had the task of raising troops and gathering supplies.\n[18] Diplomatically, Wilson's reason to enter WWI was to end the war and keep democracy safe consequently the nation got war fever. FDR's reason was to get Germany first (revenge) so then the Allies could concentrate on Japan. The Presidents and leaders as the time accounted for America's participation in the wars.hat were the reasons to oppose America's involvement in World War 1? President Wilson's reason for not going to war was b/c the war was chiefly b/w England, France, and Germany and the Americans all immigrated from Europe and he didnt wan2 figh \u2026 t with his kinsmen.\n[19] The United States in World War I declared war on the German Empire on April 6, 1917. The U.S. was an independent power and did not officially join the Allies. It closely cooperated with them militarily but acted alone in diplomacy.lthough the United States entered the war in 1917, there had been very little planning, or even recognition of the problems that the British and other Allies had to solve on their home fronts. As a result, the level of confusion was high in the first 12 months, then efficiency took control.\n[20] The German's naval policy was the major reason why the United States declared war on Germany. The sinking of the Lusitania was the biggest influence of American in WWI. It was so much of an influence that it was said without the sinking of the Lusitania, the United States most likely would not of entered the war.ne of the reasons was the British interception of the Zimmerman Note or Zimmerman Telegram. This was when Arthur Zimmerman telegraphed the Germany ambassador in Mexico to tel \u2026 l Mexico to be Germany's Ally.\nSearch Query: why did the us volunterilay enter ww1.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

The Proprietorship was a sort of middle thing between the royal province and the self-governing colony.\n[3] England was declared a republican Commonwealth and Free State in May 1649. During the early 1650s, attempts were made to incorporate Scotland and Ireland into the Commonwealth with England so that the three nations were ruled by a central government for the first time in British history.\n[4] The United States was formed from thirteen British colonies in 1776. Many of these colonies had been around for well over 100 years including the first colony of Virginia which was founded in 1607.See below for a map of the thirteen original colonies. New York (1626) - Originally founded by the Dutch. 2 Became a British colony in 1664. 3 New Hampshire (1623) - John Mason was the first land holder. 4 Later John Wheelwright.\n[5] Although styled as the State of Kentucky in the law creating it,(5) Kentucky is one of four U.S. states constituted as a commonwealth (the others being Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts). Originally a part of Virginia, in 1792 Kentucky became the 15th state to join the Union.\n[6] The United States of America is a free independent country now. Before 1776, America was not an independent country. It was a group of colonies. England controlled these colonies. Many American Colonists did not want to be controlled by the British government anymore. The Colonists were unhappy for many reasons. They couldn't make their own laws or have their own government.\n[7] The Fourth of July marks the day that the Continental Congress, our revolutionary government at the time, met in Philadelphia and formally separated from the British Empire by declaring the thirteen constituent states of the United States of America to be \"free and independent.\" By any measure, this was an extraordinary feat.\n[8] In the 17th century, the term \"commonwealth\" referred to an organized political community, or what today is called a \"state.\" Four states in the Union\u2014Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Virginia\u2014are still officially called commonwealths.\n[9] Rhode Island was the first of the original Thirteen Colonies to declare independence from British rule, declaring itself independent on May 4, 1776, two months before any other colony. The state was also the last of the thirteen original colonies to ratify the United States Constitution.\n[10] Confidence votes 175. The United States of America was never truly founded as much as it was declared independent from the Kingdom of Great Britain on July 4, 1776. This date marks the signing of the Declaration of Independence written by Thomas Jefferson. Barack Obama became president of the United States of America in 2009 and is the current president. Before he became president there was George W. Bush and Bill Clinton.\n[11] Thirteen colonies were originally part of it, and they are also known as the original states of America. The very first Colony was Virginia (originally Jamestown), was founded in 1607 and the last of the 13 colonies to form was Georgia.as founded in 1624. When the British claimed its territories in America, New York was part of the Province of York, along with Delaware, New Jersey and Vermont. The king reassigned these places after some time to become individual colonies, and New York was named after James, Duke of York.\n[12] In February 1861, representatives from the six seceded states met in Montgomery, Alabama, to formally establish a unified government, which they named the Confederate States of America. On February 9, Jefferson Davis of Mississippi was elected the Confederacy's first president.\n[13] France recognized the United States as an independent state on February 6, 1778, when France's Secretary of His Majesty's Council of State, Conrad Alexandre Gerard, g\u00e9rard And American Commissioners Benjamin, Franklin Silas, deane And Arthur lee signed two treaties In. paris\n[14] Well the former colonies of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland etc federated in 1901 forming a constitutional monarchy known as the Commonwealth of Australia.\n[15] Integration of the countries in the framework of the Commonwealth of Independent States is executed through its coordinating institutions (charter bodies, executive bodies and the bodies of branch cooperation of the CIS). Charter Bodies of the CIS: Council of the Heads of States. Council of the Heads of Governments.\n[16] The original 13 colonies made up the first 13 states of the United States. Eventually, the American land west of the Appalachian Mountains was divided into territories. At the end of the American Revolution, the new nation was still a loose confederation of states.But in 1787, American leaders got together and wrote the Constitution of the United States.

The United states\u2026 also has two insular territories that are styled commonwealths.\n[20] The United States first started to form a government at the First Continental Congress.

The seceded states created the Confederate States of America and elected Jefferson Davis, a Mississippi Senator, as their provisional president. In his inaugural address, delivered on March 4, 1861, Lincoln proclaimed that it was his duty to maintain the Union.\n[6] Federation of the states in Australia occurred on 1 January 1901. However, this was not when Australia became an independent nation. Although the Constitution of the Commonwea \u2026 lth of Australia came into effect at Federation, this did not mean that Australia was now independent of Britain.here is no simple answer to that question. Prior to 1901, Australia was made up of six self-governing colonies; New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania.\n[7] The state was created as the Irish Free State in 1922 as a result of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. It had the status of dominion until 1937 when a new constitution was adopted, in which the state was named Ireland and effectively became a republic, with an elected non-executive president as head of state.\n[8] Commonwealth Law & Legal Definition.

View slideshow of images above.\n[4] Best Answer: It has two meanings. It can mean relating to the internal organs of your body (the visceral organs), or it can mean relating to deep emotional feelings that are separate from intellect. Visceral means, roughly, in the guts. The viscera are your internal organs. The word is Latin. So, if you have a visceral feeling, it means a feeling on the inside, in your internal organs; and usually this is referring to the guts (intestines). For instance, you have a gut feeling, something you feel inside you.\n[5] The visceral layer is usually thin, delicate, and not apparent as being separate, but rather appears to be the outer surface of the structure itself.

Visceral structures are highly sensitive to distension (stretch), ischemia and inflammation, but relatively insensitive to other stimuli that normally evoke pain such as cutting or burning.he phenomenon of referred pain is secondary to the convergence of visceral afferent (sensory) nerve fibers entering the spinal cord at the same level as the superficial, somatic structures experiencing the pain.\n[7] 1.

Being or arising from impulse or sudden emotion rather than from thought or deliberation: The scientific approach to life is not really appropriate to states of visceral anguish (Anthony Burgess).\n[8] A viscero-visceral reflex is a reflex in which stimulation of visceral receptors results in activation of visceral motor phenomena.\n[9] Visceral pain is a type of nociceptive pain that comes from the internal organs. As with somatic pain, pain receptors called nociceptors send signals to the spinal cord and brain when damage is detected. Unlike somatic pain, however, visceral pain is harder to pinpoint in terms of location within the body. Some types of pelvic pain and abdominal pain, such as those caused by bladder disorders or irritable bowel syndrome, are considered to be visceral pain disorders.\n[10] Visceral (Smooth) Muscle. Visceral muscle is found in various parts of the body including blood vessels, the bladder, digestive tract, as well as in many other hollow organs.

Visceral pain is the pain we feel when our internal organs are damaged or injured and is by far the most common form of pain. Viscera refers to the internal areas of the body that are enclosed in a cavity. Visceral pain is caused by the activation of pain receptors in the chest, abdomen or pelvic areas.t is much more subjective and not easily described as acute pain. The three pain types can be felt at the same time or singly and at different times. The different types of pain respond differently to the various pain medications. Somatic and visceral pain are easier to treat than neuropathic pain.\n[15] Visceral pain is the pain, which occurs in the region of the trunk of the body that includes the lungs, heart, abdominal and pelvic organs. Some of the examples of visceral pain consist of: Chronic chest pain, appendicitis, diverticulitis, gallstones and pelvic pain. About 25% of the total population suffers from visceral pain. Visceral pain when compared to somatic pain is harder to pinpoint in regards to its location in the body.\n[16] Visceral pain is pain that results from the activation of nociceptors of the thoracic, pelvic, or abdominal viscera (organs). Visceral structures are highly sensitive to distension (stretch), ischemia and inflammation, but relatively insensitive to other stimuli that normally evoke pain such as cutting or burning.s visceral pain changes in nature as it progresses. Pain from a specific organ can be experienced, or \"referred\" to different sites of the body. There is no pathology or no cause for pain at these referred somatic sites however the pain will be experienced at this location, often with significant intensity.\n[17] Visceral pain is often described as generalized aching or squeezing. It is caused by compression in and around the organs, or by stretching of the abdominal cavity. Sometimes visceral pain may radiate to other areas in the body, making it even harder to pinpoint its exact location.\n[18] Visceral, which means \"pertaining to the soft organs in the abdomen,\" is the fat stored deep in our abdomens around the intestines, kidneys, pancreas and liver. This is the stuff that tends to make our tummies protrude in classic \"beer belly\" fashion.\n[19] Visceral fat is a specific type of fat that is found on the stomach, and goes by many other names 'your beer belly', 'spare tyre' or 'muffin top'.\n[20] Internal human organs are also called viscera.
