Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: why do hunters pattern their shotguns?.\n\n[1] Why do hunters pattern their shotguns? to decide what animal to hunt to select ammunition with the best performance to compete against other hunters to identify the best shooting position to use in the field\n[2] Why do hunters pattern their shotguns? 1. Understanding the Importance of Cartridge and Choke Performance. There's no difference between zeroing the rifle and patterning the shotgun. The process is both easy and beneficial. When hunting, it's important to adopt humane methods to capture the animal.\n[3] You will also need to learn how to use the particular gun you have, particularly the shotgun. Do you know about patterning the shotgun? If you do, you probably wonder about why do hunters pattern their shotguns. While it does seem like a tedious task at first, it reaps a ton of benefits hunters love, which is what makes it an important thing to do.\n[4] You now know what patterning a shotgun means, but why do hunters pattern their shotguns in the first place? When you shoot a shotgun while hunting, you want to make sure that you are familiarized with how it works, don't you?\n[5] This is called \"patterning your shotgun.\" All shotgun hunters need to pattern their firearms to determine which brands of shells, shot sizes, and loads perform best and at what range. A shotgun may have a good pattern (high density of hits), but shoot off target. If this is the case, you will need to have the stock adjusted by a gunsmith. \u2190 Previous\n[6] That's the reason why many hunters opt to test their shotguns and pattern it before intense hunting sessions. You wouldn't want to go in without knowing your gun well enough. Not only does this lessen the number of clean kills you can make, but it may also hurt something in the process due to inaccurate shooting.\n[7] The shot pellets from a shotgun spread upon leaving the barrel, and the power of the burning charge is divided among the pellets, which means that the energy of any one ball of shot is fairly low. In a hunting context, this makes shotguns useful primarily for hunting birds and other small game. backpacker shotgun has a short barrel and either a full-size stock or pistol grip, depending on legislation in intended markets. The overall length of these weapons is frequently less than 90 cm (35 in), with some measuring up at less than 63 cm (25 in).\n[8] A Shotgun is a weapon designed chiefly to fire rounds loaded with multiple small metal projectiles at once. Other types of ammunition have been adapted and manufactured for them, including solid slugs, sub-caliber saboted projectiles, flechettes, and a slew of 'less-lethal' rounds loaded with rubber projectiles or chemical projectiles.\n[9] Many skilled shotgun shooters have a tendency to shoot slugs the same way they shoot shotshells\u2013they just point and slap the trigger. That works fine if you're throwing out a cloud of pellets that can cover a 30-inch target circle by the time they're 30 yards from the muzzle.\n[10] A shotgun shell is a self-contained cartridge typically loaded with multiple metallic shot , which are small, generally spherical projectiles. Traditionally lead was used, but increasingly steel, tungsten or bismuth shot has replaced lead, due to laws designed to protect the environment.ost shotgun shells contain multiple pellets in order to increase the likelihood of a target being hit. A shotgun's shot spread refers to the two-dimensional pattern that these projectiles (or shot) leave behind on a target.\n[11] A shotgun (also known as a scattergun and peppergun, or historically as a fowling piece) is a firearm that is usually designed to be fired from the shoulder, which uses the energy of a fixed shell to fire a number of small spherical pellets called shot, or a solid projectile called a slug. backpacker shotgun has a short barrel and either a full-size stock or pistol grip, depending on legislation in intended markets. The overall length of these weapons is frequently less than 90 cm (35 in), with some measuring up at less than 63 cm (25 in).\n[12] A shotgun is generally a smoothbore firearm, which means that the inside of the barrel is not rifled. Preceding smoothbore firearms, such as the musket, were widely used by armies in the 18th century. backpacker shotgun has a short barrel and either a full-size stock or pistol grip, depending on legislation in intended markets. The overall length of these weapons is frequently less than 90 cm (35 in), with some measuring up at less than 63 cm (25 in).\n[13] The fact that most shotgun bores are not cylindrical also causes deviations from the ideal bore diameter. The chamber of the gun is larger, to accommodate the thickness of the shotshell walls, and a forcing cone in front of the chamber reduces the diameter down to the bore diameter.he fact that most shotgun bores are not cylindrical also causes deviations from the ideal bore diameter. The chamber of the gun is larger, to accommodate the thickness of the shotshell walls, and a forcing cone in front of the chamber reduces the diameter down to the bore diameter.\n[14] The Eyes in Shooting. The Master Eye. As with all sports (with the possible exception of rifle shooting), shotgun shooting is more straightforward when both eyes do the looking rather than just one. Two eyes see better than one and it is easier to ignore the barrels with two eyes open than with one closed.\n[15] A person who quick scopes will use a sniper rifle, but instead of aiming down the scope like sniper riffles were made for, they exploit a feature and shoot when the cross hairs meet, resulting in a one hit kill, despite the fact a majority of the time the cross hairs miss the target.\n[16] Devoted to the use of muzzleloading shotguns for hunting, Trap, Skeet and other shooting sports. For most shooters, the phrase muzzle loader is synonymous with a muzzle loading rifle. However, there are a surprising number of shooters who, at least occasionally, shoot a muzzle loading shotgun.\n[17] First things first: the gun itself. A shotgun's primary purpose is hunting. Clearly, you can use this shotgun as a hunting weapon to \"restock\" on valuable calories. Humans can go for three weeks without food, but it's not fun. Lack of food leads to light-headedness, weakness, and poor decisions. In a survival situation, meat is the fastest and most effective way to replenish lost calories.\n[18] The problem is worsened by the fact that it is perfectly safe to shoot slugs through the same shotgun barrel you use for hunting quail or ducks, and a lot of deer slug hunters do just that, rather than spend the money to get a real slug barrel with rifle sights to put on their shotguns.\n[19] Shotgun choke is the constriction at the muzzle end of the gun that tightens the pattern of pellets. In an average cartridge there are approximately 300 pellets, so how wide the shot pattern or how restricted is a matter than will make all the difference to your shooting.\n[20] Muzzle loading side by side shotguns. This beautiful version of muzzle loading side by side shotgun, which reproduces an original English model has been the indispensable friend of the traditional hunter for many years. The stock is made of walnut, the blued barrels are slightly choked and inside chromed. The locks are engraved.\nSearch Query: why do hunters pattern their shotguns?.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: what amino produces carnitine.\n\n[1] Acetyl L Carnitine is one of the more common formulations of L-Carnitine, which is itself an amino acid that is produced from two other amino acids (Lysine and Methionine). This version, or form, of L-Carnitine is significant more active than it parent compound due to a higher degree of bioavailability.\n[2] Carnitine, derived from an amino acid, is found in nearly all cells of the body. Its name is derived from the Latin carnus or flesh, as the compound was isolated from meat. Carnitine is the generic term for a number of compounds that include L-carnitine, acetyl-L-carnitine, and propionyl-L-carnitine [1-2].

It transports long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria so they can be oxidized (burned) to produce energy. It also transports the toxic compounds generated out of this cellular organelle to prevent their accumulation.\n[4] Carnitine, derived from an amino acid, is found in nearly all cells of the body.

Carnitine is the generic term for a number of compounds that include L-carnitine, acetyl-L-carnitine, and propionyl-L-carnitine [1-2].\n[5] Carnitine biosynthesis and metabolism. Carnitine, a branched non-essential amino acid, is synthesized from the essential amino acids lysine and methionine. Ascorbic acid, ferrous iron, pyroxidine and niacin are also necessary cofactors (1) and deficiencies of any of these can lead to carnitine deficiency.\n[6] In this case, carnitine substitution (food supplementation) is certainly worthwhile. Carnitine is a biocarrier (transport substance), which is synthesised in the liver \u2013 and its precursor in the kidneys \u2013 from the two essential amino acids lysine and methionine.\n[7] Nutrients for L-carnitine Production. Niacin, vitamin B-6 and iron increase metabolism by assisting with the production of L-carnitine, an amino acid that promotes fat burning, notes Vanderbilt University.

The compound plays a crucial role in energy production, as it is responsible for transporting fatty acids to the mitochondria. Mitochondria exist inside every cell in our bodies.\n[9] But before I get into the details of this flawed study, let's first take a closer look at carnitine and what it does in your body. The Transporter. L-carnitine, or just carnitine (the L refers to the configuration of the carnitine molecule that is biologically active) is often referred to as an amino acid, but it is not a true amino acid. Carnitine is an amino acid-like compound that is made in the body from the amino acids lysine and methionine. Its name is derived from the Greek word for flesh or meat, carnus. Not so coincidentally, it's abundant in red meat and dairy products, but it can also be found in various nuts, grains, and green vegetables.\n[10] Where it comes from: Carnitine (and L-carnitine) is a nutrient that helps the body break down fat and turn it into energy. It also increases the activity of certain nerve cells in the central nervous system. Carnitine is an amino acid naturally produced by the body in the liver and kidneys and stored in the skeletal muscles, heart, brain and sperm. The nutrient also occurs in fish, poultry, red meat and some types of dairy.\n[11] Carnitine: What is it? Carnitine, derived from an amino acid, is found in nearly all cells of the body. Its name is derived from the Latin carnus or flesh, as the compound was isolated from meat. Carnitine is the generic term for a number of compounds that include L-carnitine, acetyl-L-carnitine, and propionyl-L-carnitine [1,2].\n[12] Carnitine actually comes in four forms: D-carnitine, DL-carnitine, L-carnitine and Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC). Only the last two could be of actual use to bodybuilders. When there is enough Thiamin (Vitamin B1) and pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) in circulation, it can trigger methionine and lysine to manufacture carnitine.\n[13] L-carnosine, not to be confused with L-carnitine, is a substance manufactured in the human body, made by combining the amino acids alanine and histidine.

It helps the body produce energy.Acetyl-L-carnitine is used for a variety of mental disorders including Alzheimer's disease, age-related memory loss, late-life depression, thinking problems related to alcoholism, and thinking problems related to Lyme disease.cetyl-L-carnitine is an amino acid (a building block for proteins) that is naturally produced in the body. It helps the body produce energy.\n[17] L-Lysine is one of 9 essential amino acids that cannot be made in the body. It is the basic raw material for carnitine synthesis. L-Proline can be made in the body but low protein/vegetarian diets may not promote optimal l-proline production.\n[18] Background. Carnitine is a naturally occurring hydrophilic amino acid derivative, produced endogenously in the kidneys and liver and derived from meat and dairy products in the diet.It plays an essential role in the transfer of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation.arnitine deficiency is a metabolic state in which carnitine concentrations in plasma and tissues are less than the levels required for normal function of the organism. Biologic effects of low carnitine levels may not be clinically significant until they reach less than 10-20% of normal.\n[19] While it is often categorized as an amino acid, L-carnitine isn't technically an amino. It is considered a vitamin-like and amino acid-like compound that is related to the B vitamins. When it was first studied back in the 1950s, L-carnitine was referred to as vitamin BT.

As stated, these bronchioles do not have hyaline cartilage to maintain their patency. Instead, they rely on elastic fibers attached to the surrounding lung tissue for support.\n[4] The histological structure of the epithelium and the underlying connective tissue of the bronchi corresponds largely to that of the trachea and the main bronchi. In addition, bronchi are surrounded by a layer of smooth muscle, which is located between the cartilage and epithelium.n addition to the staple of basal cells, ciliated cells and goblet cells, the respiratory epithelium also contains brush cells, endocrine cells (or small granule cells, function not clear) , surfactant-producing cells (or Clara cells) , and serous cells. Epithelium and underlying lamina propria are called the mucosa.\n[5] The innermost layer consists of ciliated mucous membrane. Kinds of bronchi are lobar bronchus (secondary bronchus), primary bronchus, and segmental bronchus (tertiary bronchus) . Also called bronchial tube.

Bronchioles divide into even smaller bronchioles, called terminal, which are 0.5mm or less in diameter.\n[11] The bronchioles are part of the airway passages in the lungs. They are located at the end of the bronchi, the larger, branching airway passages in the lungs, and terminate in the alveoli, tiny circular sacs where oxygen is exchanged with carbon dioxide in the blood.\n[12] Bronchioles are small airways that branch off the bronchi in the lungs. Their role is to transport air to the alveoli where gas exchange can take place.\n[13] Bronchospasm, a potentially life-threatening situation, occurs when the smooth muscular tissue of the bronchioles constricts, severely narrowing their diameter. The most common cause of this is asthma. Bronchospasm is commonly treated by oxygen therapy and bronchodilators.he diameter of the bronchioles is often said to be less than 1 mm, though this value can actually range from 5 mm to 0.3 mm. As stated, these bronchioles do not have hyaline cartilage to maintain their patency. Instead, they rely on elastic fibers attached to the surrounding lung tissue for support.\n[14] The terminal bronchiole is the most distal segment of the conducting zone. It branches off the lesser bronchioles. Each of the terminal bronchioles divides to form respiratory bronchioles which contain a small number of alveoli. Terminal bronchioles are lined with simple cuboidal epithelium containing club cells. Terminal bronchioles contain a limited number of ciliated cells and no goblet cells. Club cells are non-ciliated, rounded protein secreting cells. Their secretions are a nonsticky, proteinaceous compound to maintain the airway in the smallest bronchioles.\n[15] The epithelium is either columnar or cuboidal. The final branches of the bronchioles are called terminal bronchioles. These have a layer smooth muscle surrounding their lumens. Stimulation of the vagus nerve (parasympathetic) causes the smooth muscle to contract, and reduce the diameter of the terminal bronchioles.he trachea branches to give rise to two primary (main) bronchii. These then branch successively to give rise in turn to secondary and tertiary bronchii. These then branch to give rise to several orders of progressively smaller airways called bronchioles, the smallest of which are called terminal bronchioles.\n[16] They are branches of the bronchi, and are part of the conducting zone of the respiratory system.

The bronchioles connect to the alveoli (air sacs). Last Editorial Review: 5/13/2016.\n[18] What are Bronchioles. The smallest airways within the lungs that are not encircled by any cartilage are called bronchioles (1). Once the trachea divides into the left and right primary bronchi, they then branch into smaller and smaller divisions to lead to bronchioles.\n[19] Bronchioles are small airways that branch off the bronchi in the lungs.

I know that many bridal stores in my area advise the bride to budget about $150 for gown alterations (not including steaming). good guess would be around $30 to $80 for the average gown. With replacement of beads and other decorations or boning, it can easily go over $100. Sleeve length is another area I check for alteration needs. If the gown has no sleeves, or short ones, this is not a concern.\n[10] 1 A bodice can be altered from $20 to $150. 2 If you want to have a wedding dress completely redesigned or even have additional materials added to it, the price of this type of job could cost anywhere from $250 to as much as $600 depending on the type of material as well as the complexity of the wedding dress design.he cost of wedding dress alteration depends on the amount of work that needs to be done on the dress as well as the complexity of the design. 1 On average, a simple alteration can cost as little as $20 while a more complex job can cost upwards of $350 for an alteration.\n[11] 1 Wedding dress alterations can run anywhere from $50-$300 depending on the amount of work needed. 2 If you choose a dress that is meant to be full below the waist, an extra piece can be purchased to add to the body of the dress. 3 This piece can cost $30-$100.

In the DC area to alter a simple gown will be average $500 ... if the gown is more complex, then the alterations are more expensive.est Answer: How big is this dress? For a wedding dress that needs bustling and hemming, I'd say 100-200 is average. For a simple gown, I'd say $30-50. It depends on multiple things. The fabric-how easy is it to work with.\n[14] 1 Do not forget to factor in the cost of alterations, which can run from $20 for a small nip or tuck in the bodice to $200 or more for more labor-intensive work. 2 If you buy your dress at a bridal salon, ask whether alterations are included and, if not, get a written estimate of the alteration costs ahead of time.

Hip replacement devices break into a few big categories: Metal on Metal (MOM) \u2013 These are what they sound like. Both the socket and the ball are made of stainless steel, titanium, chromium, cobalt or some combination of these.\n[2] The implant for a total hip replacement is composed of 3 parts: the stem, the ball, and the socket. The stem is made out of metal, usually cobalt-chrome or titanium, and is placed within the native thighbone. The ball is usually made out of polished metal or ceramic, and fits on top of the stem.\n[3] As a result, some of these implants have been recalled. Implants may be made of a variety of materials including metal (usually titanium), ceramic or polyethylene (a type of hard plastic). Ongoing research and enabling technology will determine new directions in materials used in hip replacement surgery.\n[4] A prosthetic made of metal and plastic are the most commonly used hip replacement implants. Both the ball and the socket of the hip joint are replaced with a metal implant, and a plastic spacer is placed in between. The most commonly used metals used include titanium and stainless steel.\n[5] In metal-on-metal devices both the ball and socket components are made of metal. These metal implants have been used in total hip replacement surgeries and hip resurfacing procedures. Because of metal's durability, metal-on-metal devices were expected to last longer than other hip implants.\n[6] Metal and Plastic Implants. A prosthetic made of metal and plastic are the most commonly used hip replacement implants. Both the ball and the socket of the hip joint are replaced with a metal implant, and a plastic spacer is placed in between. The most commonly used metals used include titanium and stainless steel.\n[7] Implants may be made of a variety of materials including metal (usually titanium), ceramic or polyethylene (a type of hard plastic). Ongoing research and enabling technology will determine new directions in materials used in hip replacement surgery.\n[8] All hip resurfacing operations use a metal-on-metal bearing hip. Most total hip replacements are not metal-on-metal bearings and use other materials including ceramic and high density polyethylene. Your hospital will always have a record of your operation and what implants were used.\n[9] The same materials are used for hip implants\u2014the stem portions of most hip implants are made of metal alloys, the ball portions are made from metal alloys or polished ceramic, and the acetabular sockets are made from metal, polyethylene (plastic), a combination of polyethylene backed by metal, or ceramic.\n[10] Ceramic Implants. Ceramic hip replacement implants also use metal parts that fit within the bone, but the bearing surface (the ball and the socket) can be made of the ceramic material. Ceramic hip implants are designed to be the most resistant to wear of all available hip replacement implants.\n[11] The most common is Ti-6 aluminum Ti-4 vanadium (Ti6Al4V), but other more modern alloys are coming into use. Because of the lower moduli of elasticity than cobalt-based alloys or surgical stainless steel, titanium-based alloys have not been found to be as reliable a material when used as a cemented hip replacement.\n[12] Trunnionosis, Metallosis, and Their Effects. What is Trunnionosis? Hip replacements, specifically of the metal-on-metal variety, are composed of several parts, including the ball, the stem, and the prosthesis. In the majority of hip replacements that are produced today, the prosthesis rests on top of the ball.\n[13] Hip replacements are among the most common orthopedic procedures. When a hip replacement is performed, the arthritic, damaged hip joint is removed. The ball-and-socket hip joint is then replaced with an artificial implant. Hare are brief descriptions of some of the most commonly used hip replacement implants. Not all implants are options for all patients. A prosthetic made of metal and plastic are the most commonly used hip replacement implants. Both the ball and the socket of the hip joint are replaced with a metal implant, and a plastic spacer is placed in between. The most commonly used metals used include titanium and stainless steel.\n[14] Arthritis damages the cartilage-covered surfaces of the joint so the ball moves less smoothly and less freely within the socket. In a hip replacement or resurfacing operation, the surgeon replaces the damaged surfaces with artificial parts, which may be made of metal, plastic or ceramic materials.\n[15] In a traditional total hip replacement, the head of the thighbone (femoral head) and the damaged socket (acetabulum) are both removed and replaced with metal, plastic, or ceramic components. In hip resurfacing, the femoral head is not removed, but is instead trimmed and capped with a smooth metal covering.\n[16] Hip Replacement Implant Materials. There are a large number of hip implant devices on the market. These category names reference the materials used for the implant bearings. The stem and ball fit into and articulate against the cup or acetabulum. Each component can be made of one of several materials. There is no consensus in the orthopedic community regarding the single \"best\" bearing or material.\n[17] A.

During total hip replacement surgery, the damaged portions of the hip joint are removed. The ball (femoral head) is removed and replaced with a prosthetic ball made of metal or ceramic, and the socket (acetabulum) is removed and replaced with a prosthetic cup.\nSearch Query: what metal are hip replacements made of.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

A Pareto chart is a special type of histogram that represents the Pareto philosophy (the 80/20 rule) through displaying the events by order of impact.\n[13] Pareto Analysis is a statistical technique in decision-making used for the selection of a limited number of tasks that produce significant overall effect. It uses the Pareto Principle (also known as the 80/20 rule) the idea that by doing 20% of the work you can generate 80% of the benefit of doing the entire job.\n[14] Histogram versus Pareto Chart. There are number of charts used to evaluate and analyze quality results within a project. Two charts that are similar and often confused are the histogram and Pareto chart. A histogram is a type of bar chart showing a distribution of variables. A histogram represents each attribute or characteristic as a column and the frequency of each attribute or characteristic occurring as the height of the column.\n[15] Pareto Analysis is a statistical technique in decision making that is used for the selection of a limited number of tasks that produce significant overall effect.

The first one invented was a marine chronometer, and it was created out of the necessity to have an accurate timekeeper for sea travel. John Harrison, a British clockmaker, invented this device in 1737.\n[2] The term chronometer was coined by Jeremy Thacker of Beverley, England in 1714, referring to his invention of a clock ensconced in a vacuum chamber. The term chronometer is also used to describe a marine chronometer used for celestial navigation and determination of longitude. The marine chronometer was invented by John Harrison in 1730. This was the first of a series of chronometers that enabled accurate marine navigation. From then on, an accurate chronometer was essential to deep sea marine or air navigation out of sight of land.\n[3] The term chronometer is also used to describe a marine chronometer used for celestial navigation and determination of longitude. The marine chronometer was invented by John Harrison in 1730. This was the first of a series of chronometers that enabled accurate marine navigation. From then on, an accurate chronometer was essential to deep sea marine or air navigation out of sight of land.\n[4] He invented the marine chronometer, a long-sought after device for solving the problem of establishing the East-West position or longitude of a ship at sea, thus revolutionising and extending the possibility of safe long-distance sea travel in the Age of Sail.\n[5] The invention of the chronometer was a fundamental building block for modern times. But the marine chronometer was then redesigned by John Arnold. He based his design on Harrison's clock, but he simplified it enough to produce accurate marine chronometers in large quantities during the late 1700s.\n[6] The German physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit (1686 1736) came first. In 1714, he invented the mercury-in-glass thermometer that 300 years on is still one of the most accurate and most widely used means of measuring temperature.\n[7] Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit was a Dutch-German-Polish physicist, engineer, and glass blower who is best known for inventing the alcohol thermometer in 1709 and the mercury therm \u2026 ometer in 1714, and for developing a temperature scale now named after him.\n[8] Erik Von Weber/ Stone/ Getty Images. What can be considered the first modern thermometer, the mercury thermometer with a standardized scale, was invented by Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit (1686-1736) in 1714. Daniel Gabriel began training as a merchant in Amsterdam after his parents died on August 14, 1701 from eating poisonous mushrooms.\n[9] The Greeks had simple thermometers in the first century BC. Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) Italian physicist, invented a basic air thermometer. Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit (168\u20266-1736) was the German physicist who invented the alcohol thermometer in 1709, and the mercury thermometer in 1714.

Without special attention, this practice can very quickly deplete the female of her bone calcium and other essential nutrients, leading to a very early death.\n[3] A good hatch depends on how well you know your incubator. For the first 14 days the button quail eggs should be turned (better described as being rotated from one side to the other) at least twice a day. Three or four times a day is better.

On average they will lay 200-300 eggs per year.\n[10] Bobwhite quail hens do not lay as many eggs as the coturnix, averaging 150 to 200 eggs annually. In contrast to the coturnix, bobwhite eggs take between 23 and 24 days to hatch.\n[11] How many eggs does a quail lay?

Quail start to lay eggs at just 8-12 weeks (assuming there is enough daylight) so they are productive very quickly compared to chickens. Four quail eggs are roughly the same as a chicken egg, although they have a slightly higher quantity of yolk to white in an egg.\n[15] Egg Turning. Quail incubation periods vary by species. Bobwhite hatch in 23 to 24 days, Coturnix in just 17, for example. Eggs need to be placed in the incubator with the large end slightly elevated. Then, the egg needs to be turned on its axis five to seven times per day.\n[16] A quail which is breed to lay eggs should receive 14 hours of light per day.

I hope this answered your question.ow many eggs do quail lay at one time? No bird can lay more than an egg every day (or just a little less than 24 hours).\n[17] October 12, 2009. Quail lay eggs early and often. These tiny birds begin laying while barely little more than chicks themselves, and can lay up to 300 eggs annually. In the United States, the coturnix quail is the most common type raised domestically. This breed is also known as the Japanese quail, the Bible quail and the Nile quail.\n[18] In the right conditions, each hen can lay 300+ per year. They begin laying eggs in 6 to 8 weeks and the eggs only take 17 days to incubate. Because Coturnix quail mature extremely quickly, the waiting period to enjoy the fruits of your labors are very quick.\n[19] 3. So, you have your eggs, how long do they need to be incubated for? My experience is with Japanese (Coturnix) Quail and Button Quail only, so here are the incubation and hatch times for those two. Japanese (Coturnix) Quail eggs hatch around 17-18 days once you start incubation. They can take up to 21-22 days to hatch, so don't worry if they don't hatch on day 17. Some may even hatch as early as day 15. Button Quail eggs hatch around 16-17 days once you start incubation. It can take up to 22 days, so don't worry if they don't hatch on day 16. Don't make the mistake of counting from the day they were laid.\n[20] Quail are most fertile and productive between the ages of 2 and 8 months, when hens usually lay one egg daily. At 9 months and beyond, fertility declines, although the average hen may still produce 200 or so eggs annually. For best results, keep one male with just two to three females.\nSearch Query: how often to button quail lay eggs.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

When the muscle contracts, this movement causes the attached bone (or bones) to follow.\n[11] They work together, with the muscles contracting and pulling on tendons attached to bones, therefore pulling or pushing the bones to create movement. They control movement of the body together The muscular system and the skeletal system work together to provide support and movement for the body.Your muscles are connected to your bones by a material called cartilage.hey work together, with the muscles contracting and pulling on tendons attached to bones, therefore pulling or pushing the bones to create movement. They control movement of the body together The muscular system and the skeletal system work together to provide support and movement for the body.\n[12] Oct 21, 2015. Only skeletal muscles work with bones and muscles keep bones in place and also play a role in the movement of bones. To allow motion, different bones are connected by joints. A skeletal muscle may attach a bone to another bone (often across a joint) or a bone to another structure, such as skin. When the muscle contracts, one of the structures usually remains stationary, while the other moves.\n[13] Chapter 16: Systems, Support, and Movement 585 Movement The works with the skeletal system to allow move-ment. Like all muscles, the muscles that produce movement are made upof individual cells called muscle fibers. These fibers contract and relax.Most of the muscles involved in moving the body work in pairs. Asthey contract, muscles shorten, pulling against bones. It may surpriseyou to know that muscles do not push.\n[14] Movement is made possible because of the way that bones, muscles, tendons and ligaments work together. Bones are rigid tissues that can support weight without bending.Muscle is tissue that can contract and relax to cause movement. Tendons are strong, fibrous, flexible connective tissue that joins muscles to bone.ur skeletal-muscular system enables us to move and exercise. Our joints are adapted to allow smooth movement and to resist wear and tear. Cartilage, for example, prevents bones from rubbing together. Sometimes, however, injuries do occur.\n[15] Yes.

Muscles generally work in pairs to produce movement: when one muscle flexes (or contracts) the other relaxes, a process known as antagonism.\n[18] ---Bones form the structure for our body, while muscles are responsible for pulling the joints, allowing \u2026 us to move. The cartilage, muscles, ligaments, and tendons, all working as one holding bones together and letting joints move. Muscles connect the joints to the bones.our muscles have the task of pulling your ligaments and joints so you can move your body limbs and organs, the muscles and bones work together by pulling on each other and supporting each other to move body parts.\n[19] Chapter 16: Systems, Support, and Movement 585 Movement The works with the skeletal system to allow move-ment. Like all muscles, the muscles that produce movement are made upof individual cells called muscle fibers. These fibers contract and relax.Most of the muscles involved in moving the body work in pairs.\n[20] The point of articulation, or where the muscles and the bones connect, is known as a joint. Tendons are a form of connective tissue that is continuous with muscle fiber and actually connects muscle to bone.Skeletal muscles that produce movement are attached to two bones that articulate, or meet.long with the joints, which act as fulcrums, the bones and muscles work together to create levers in the body. Depending on the location of the load in relation to the joint or fulcrum, muscles and bones create either a mechanical advantage or disadvantage when you lift an object.\nSearch Query: describe how muscles and bones work together to produce movement.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: what does it mean if your tsh is low.\n\n[1] 3 doctors agreed: 1 Yes: A low TSH usually means that you are have a high level of thyroid hormone in your system and hyperthyroidism can be associated with hair loss. 2 Generally low: Tsh will lead to an increased tendency for hair to break due to poor protein in the hair shaft, but it's not true hair loss. 3 Wrong assumptions: Iron level not relevant.\n[2] Low TSH Levels: What They Can Mean. Low TSH can indicate that there's an abundance of thyroid hormone being produced by the thyroid gland, so the pituitary gland sees no need to release TSH.\n[3] Yes: A low TSH usually means that you are have a high level of thyroid hormone in your system and hyperthyroidism can be associated with hair loss. Usually the hair becomes softer and finer with hyperthyroidism as opposed to the hair loss with hypothyroidism which is usually associated with ...Read more.\n[4] Conversely, a low TSH reflects either a low need or desire for thyroid hormone or a low tolerance for the thyroid hormone and is meant to reduce thyroid hormone production. An optimal value of TSH means the thyroid hormone levels match the body's energy needs and/or ability to utilize the energy.\n[5] What does a Low TSH Mean? Your thyroid gland is producing too much of the thyroid hormone which signals to your brain to stop producing anymore. Individuals who suffer from low TSH levels and high levels of T3 and T4 (the thyroid hormones) have a condition that is commonly referred to as hyperthyroidism.\n[6] What do low TSH levels mean? According to About.com, low levels of TSH, or thyroid-stimulating hormone, occur when the pituitary gland shuts down TSH production due to high levels of thyroid hormone in the blood. The low levels of TSH are the pituitary gland's attempt to keep thyroid hormone levels normal within the body. What are some symptoms associated with high TSH levels? According to WebMD, high TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) levels indicate an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism). Common symptoms include feeling weak, tired or depressed, sensitivity to cold, constipation, brittle nails, memory problems, and heavy or irregular periods.\n[7] If TSH is high, it typically means that your thyroid function is too low (hypothyroid). If TSH is low, then it generally means the thyroid is overactive (hyperthyroid.) Your doctor may also check levels of other thyroid hormones in your blood.\n[8] There are 2 reasons that could be the cause behind your low TSH: 1 Your glands simply aren't producing enough; Your thyroid gland is producing too much of the thyroid hormone which signals to your brain to stop producing anymore.\n[9] Most providers would have you believe that a low TSH in the presence of taking thyroid medication is \u200ba sign of hyperthyroidism. This would indicate that you need to LOWER your dose of thyroid medication to achieve a euthyroid status in the body.\n[10] There are 2 reasons that could be the cause behind your low TSH: 1 Your glands simply aren't producing enough; 2 Your thyroid gland is producing too much of the thyroid hormone which signals to your brain to stop producing anymore.\n[11] A low TSH result indicates that the thyroid gland is overactive, and is producing too many hormones. A high TSH result is indicative of hypothyroidism, because the thyroid is not responding properly to the pituitary gland, and thus, is not creating enough hormones.\n[12] Responses (3) Confusing I know but in general a low TSH is indicative of an overactive thyroid or hyperthyroidism and your thyroid hormone dose needs to be reduced. A high TSH is indicative of an underactive thyroid or hypothyroidism and your medicine needs increasing.\n[13] A low TSH result may indicate: 1 An overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) 2 Excessive amounts of thyroid hormone medication in those who are being treated for an underactive (or removed) thyroid gland.\n[14] TSH levels in your bloodstream rise or fall depending on whether there is enough thyroid hormone in your system to meet your body's needs. Higher levels of TSH push the thyroid to produce more hormone. Low TSH levels mean the thyroid is producing more than enough hormone. TSH levels can change a great deal with minor increases and decreases in T4. This is a very tightly regulated feedback process between the pituitary and the thyroid gland.\n[15] No: There are no such foods such as that. If your TSH level is low, that means your thyroid is overproducing thyroid hormone and that could be a goiter or other thyroid disease-you definitely need that checked and treated. If your thyroid hormone is low, then your TSH would be high.\n[16] Patients suffering from low TSH usually have high T3/T4 hormone levels. Since having a low TSH level is usually associated with hyperthyroidism, which causes other symptoms, it's important to do everything you can to get your TSH levels back to normal and prevent it from dropping again.\n[17] The most obvious cause of a TSH change is a change in dosage. But sometimes, the interaction between TSH and dosage changes can be confusing. For example, you may remember your doctor saying your thyroid is low -- and interpret that as meaning that you are hypothyroid. But the doctor may have said -- or may have meant -- your TSH is low -- which is indicative of hyperthyroidism.\n[18] Low TSH and high FT4 levels are usually seen in people with a condition called hyperthyroidism, the end result of an overactive thyroid gland. Low TSH levels can also indicate that the pituitary gland itself is damaged; however, this is very rare.\n[19] However, if an individual suffers from low TSH levels AND low levels of thyroid hormones, then it could mean that the pituitary gland (which is responsible for producing thyroid) is weak from disease or damaged.\n[20] \u200bA low TSH, assuming you aren't taking medication, is a sign that you may be hyperthyroid. But that's not what I want to focus on here. Instead I want to spend time explaining what happens to your TSH when you are taking thyroid hormone.\nSearch Query: what does it mean if your tsh is low.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Fibroblasts and endothelial cells begin proliferating to form a specialized type of tissue that is the hallmark of healing called granulation tissue. The term derives from its pink, soft, granular appearance on surface of wound but its histological features are:\n[2] Granulation tissue is composed of capillaries, fibroblasts, macrophages (to clean up debris), and collagen, fibronectin, and proteoglycans. Neovascularization - Within days, angiogenesisi begins and new capillaries form and supply nutrients in addition to providing some initial bridging of the wound.\n[3] Granulation tissue is collagen-rich tissue which forms at the site of an injury. As the body heals, this tissue fills in the injury, and may eventually scar over. The scar may fade over time, especially if the wound is small. In some cases, the body produces too much granulation tissue, in a condition known as proud flesh, in which case medical treatment may be required to halt the overproduction. The appearance of granulation tissue is a good sign. When a wound starts granulating, it means that the body is starting to rebuild after the injury. This highly fibrous tissue is usually pink because the body produces numerous small blood vessels to provide a supply of oxygen and nutrients to remove waste.\n[4] Granulation tissue is formed at the site of an injury and is composed of rich collagen. Slowly as the injury tries to heal, this tissue fills up the space and leaves a mark or scar at the place of injury.

Granulation tissue is caused by the child's body attempting to fix the skin disrupted by the tube and usually it occurs as part of the wound healing process. Depending on it's stage it appears as a red, pink or randomly colored bumpy tissue formed on the surface around the tubes' stoma.\n[11] Granulation tissue can be noted from the healthy wound buds that protrude from the wound base. During wound healing, granulation tissue usually appears during the proliferative phase. Angiogenesis is the process by which new blood vessels form, bringing in tiny capilarry buds that appear as granular tissue.\n[12] Image Credit: Main Image: Granulation tissue is formed at the site of an injury and is composed of rich collagen.

Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: what medium do radio waves travel through.\n\n[1] They do not require a medium to travel through. A radio wave is composed of an electrical wave, and a magnetic wave. The 2 waves travel together, creating each other as the wave travels through what ever medium it is in, be that air, wire, or what we call space. kerry k \u00b7 10 years ago.\n[2] Radio waves do not travel well through water.Radio waves travel at the speed of light, and just like light, are absorbed by water, in the same way as the deeper you go the dar \u2026 ker it gets.\n[3] The more dense the medium, the faster sound waves will travel through that medium\n[4] Since the actual oscillations take place at right angles to the direction of wave propagation, radio waves are transverse waves. Since radio waves are not mechanical, they do not need a medium to travel in; they can travel even in a vacuum. Like all types of electromagnetic waves, radio waves travel at a speed of about 300 000 km per second in a vacuum. When radio waves enter into other material, they slow down a little. When you tune a radio to listen to a particular frequency, the radio takes in the signals at that frequency.\n[5] For three of the four, you have named the medium ... rope, slinky, and. tuning fork. In each case, there would be no wave without it. The radio wave, as well as all other electromagnetic waves, can travel. through material media, but don't need one in order to propagate.\n[6] Quick Answer. Radio waves travel at a velocity that is equal to the speed of light traveling in a vacuum, which is 186,282 miles per second. Top speed is only possible in empty space; passing through transparent liquids and solids like crystals cause waves to bend, which slows down their speed. Continue Reading.\n[7] The radio wave travels through the subsurface and bounces off of soil and rock layers. Faults, contacts between different rock types, and discrete objects like boulders or voids are then visible. GPR has a variety of effective depths (generally <100 feet) and resolutions, depending on the type of equipment used and soil conditions at each site.\n[8] RF (radio frequency) is an electromagnetic wave form that can be distorted by metal and magnetic fields but can travel in a vacuum. ultrasound is a physical wave form that requires a medium to travel in (solid or liquid) and will not travel in a vacuum.\n[9] Actually, radio waves travel very quickly through space. Radio waves are a kind of electromagnetic radiation, and thus they move at the speed of light. The speed of light is a little less than 300,000 km per second. At that speed, a beam of light could go around the Earth at the equator more then 7 times in a second.\n[10] Radio waves are photons like light. When photons pass through regions where their speed changes they tend to bend, from their original trajectory. The same phenomenon occurs when you put a spoon in water. you will see it bend. The photons reach the ionosphere where the refraction rate is different, so they bend.\n[11] Medium wavelength radio waves are reflected from the ionosphere, a layer of charged particles in the upper atmosphere, so they can be used for long distance communication. Digital radio has better-quality reception as it uses digital signals and so does not have problems of noise and interference.\n[12] Radio waves travel at the speed of light. When passing through an object, they are slowed according to that object's permeability and permittivity. The wavelength is the distance from one peak of the wave's electric field to the next, and is inversely proportional to the frequency of the wave.\n[13] Radio waves travel at the speed of light. When passing through an object, they are slowed according to that object's permeability and permittivity. The wavelength is the distance from one peak of the wave's electric field (wave's peak/crest) to the next, and is inversely proportional to the frequency of the wave.\n[14] So visible light travels through glass, but not thick wood. Radio waves are long and pass through buildings because of this. Also, gamma rays are short and therefore very high energy which is another way to pass though materials. Interestingly, very long radio waves drag in the earth and water, slowing down and will hug the Earth...\n[15] ultraviolet will not pass through dense matter, radio does, sound travels at most at 600[m/s], telemetry uses radio waves (afaik), so i would say radio waves (not certain though) anonymous.\n[16] Radio wave, wave from the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum at lower frequencies than microwaves. The wavelengths of radio waves range from thousands of metres to 30 cm. These correspond to frequencies as low as 3 Hz and as high as 1 gigahertz (10 9 Hz). Radio-wave communications signals travel through the air in a straight line, reflect off of clouds or layers of the ionosphere, or are relayed by satellites in space. They are used in standard broadcast radio and television, shortwave radio, navigation and air-traffic control, cellular telephony, and even remote-controlled toys.\n[17] include the low-energy waves that are used to communicate over long distances through radio and television.(can carry sound waves) electromagnetic waves can travel through a vacuum; at 300,000,000 m/s\n[18] 1 Remember that waves transport energy from place to place. The energy carried by a radio wave is low, while the energy carried by a gamma ray is high. Different materials can block different types of light. More specifically, the earth's atmosphere only allows certain wavelengths of light to penetrate to the surface.\n[19] No, a radio wave is not a mechanical wave. A radio wave is a form of electromagnetic (EM) energy, and it does not require a medium through which to travel like a mechanical wa\u2026ve does. Radio waves can travel through the vacuum of space.\n[20] How fast do radio waves travel? Radio waves travel at a velocity that is equal to the speed of light traveling in a vacuum, which is 186,282 miles per second.
