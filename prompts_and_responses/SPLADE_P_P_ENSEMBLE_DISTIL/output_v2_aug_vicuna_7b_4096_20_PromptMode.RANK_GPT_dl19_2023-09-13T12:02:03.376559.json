It depends on how long the flea remains in the dormant stage (eggs, larvae, pupa). Outside influences, such as weather, affect the flea cycle. A female flea can lay around 20 to 25 eggs in one day.\n[2] The life cycle of a flea can last anywhere from 20 days to an entire year. It depends on how long the flea remains in the dormant stage (eggs, larvae, pupa). Outside influences, such as weather, affect the flea cycle. A female flea can lay around 20 to 25 eggs in one day. The flea egg stage is the beginning of the flea cycle. This part of the flea cycle represents a little more than one third of the flea population at any given time. Depending on the temperature and humidity of the environment the egg can take from two to six days to hatch.\n[3] There are four stages in a flea's life: egg, larva (maggoty-like-thing), pupa (in a cocoon) and adult. Egg-to-egg life cycle is usually two to four weeks. Under the right conditions this can be a little shorter (12 days), or much longer (8 months).\n[4] How long is the life span of a flea? 30-90 Days (Average). A flea might live a year and a half under ideal conditions. These include the right temperature, food supply, and humidity. Generally speaking, though, an adult flea only lives for 2 or 3 months. Without a host for food, a flea's life might be as short as a few days.\n[5] How long is the life span of a flea? 30-90 Days (Average). A flea might live a year and a half under ideal conditions.

Without a host for food, a flea's life might be as short as a few days. But with ample food supply, the adult flea will often live up to 100 days.\n[6] The total flea life cycle can range from a couple weeks to several months, depending on environmental conditions. ADULT: The adult flea is very flat side to side. There are hair-like bristles on the flea body and legs to aid in their navigation through pet hair.\n[7] The flea life cycle. Adult fleas spend most of their time on your dog or cat. They can live up to two years and a female will start laying eggs within two days of finding a host. The eggs that are laid by females fall off the cat or dog into the environment along with 'flea dirts' (flea excrement).\n[8] 30-90 Days (Average). A flea might live a year and a half under ideal conditions. These include the right temperature, food supply, and humidity. Generally speaking, though, an adult flea only lives for 2 or 3 months. Without a host for food, a flea's life might be as short as a few days.\n[9] Fleas have four main stages in their life cycle: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. The total flea life cycle can range from a couple weeks to several months, depending on environmental conditions. The adult flea is very flat side to side.\n[10] There are four stages in the life cycle of a flea: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Depending on the environmental temperature and humidity levels, the total life cycle will take anywhere from a couple weeks to many months. Optimal conditions for fleas are between 70-85\u00b0F and 70 percent humidity.\n[11] Fleas have four life stages, lasting weeks or months, depending on the environment. An adult flea can live up to two weeks without a host. Fleas have four life stages, lasting weeks or months, depending on the environment.\n[12] How long is the life span of a flea?

Cornell Entomology Fact Sheet on Fleas - This fact sheet provides the basics on the flea species, behavior, ecology, life history, and management.\n[13] The so-called \"sand-flea\" is nothing more than a common flea that is breeding outdoors in the soil. Contrary to belief, fleas cannot go through several generations without having a blood meal. The entire life cycle (Figure 5) of a flea can require two weeks to two years. Hot, wet, summer months favor egg laying.\n[14] The flea life cycle has four stages: Egg: An adult female flea can lay up to 40 eggs a day. The eggs are laid on the host \u200bbut will dry and fall off that host into the environment (pet bedding, carpet, etc). Eggs typically hatch within about two days.\n[15] How Long Do Fleas Live. Flea Life Span. Fleas can live up to a year and a half when they have a food supply, the optimum temperature (70F to 85F), and ideal humidity (70%). In reality though, most live for an average of 2-3 months.\n[16] A female flea will begin to lay eggs within 24-48 hours of her first blood meal. She defecates blood from her host that will fall off the host along with the eggs, re-starting the life cycle. Adult fleas can live for about 4-6 weeks depending on the environment.\n[17] Once the flea reaches adulthood, its primary goal is to find blood and then to reproduce. Its total life span can be as long one and one-half years in ideal conditions. Female fleas can lay 5000 or more eggs over their life, allowing for phenomenal growth rates. Average 30\u201390 days.\n[18] 6 weeks. In 3 weeks, one flea can pass through its entire life cycle and can lay 1000 eggs. In another 3 weeks, those eggs can hatch and lay 1,000 eggs each, so within 6 weeks, it is possible to have a million new fleas.\n[19] Stickfast flea life history. The complete life cycle of the flea takes about four weeks, varying according to the temperature. The female fleas lay at night while attached to the bird, and the very small eggs fall to the ground. In about four days, small wormlike larvae emerge from the eggs. The larvae feed on organic material, mainly the dried blood excreted by the adult fleas, and shelter in the surface dust and litter on the soil.\n[20] The cat flea's life cycle is one of complete metamorphosis: an egg stage, larval (grub) stage, pupal (cocoon) stage and adult stage. The cat flea's life cycle usually lasts from about 1 to 2 \u00bd months and depends on the temperature and humidity of their habitat. Adults are the only stage that lives on the host, and the female adult cat flea must have a fresh blood meal in order to produce a new batch of eggs.\nSearch Query: how long is life cycle of flea.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

A ruling of a court in a civil case which declares the rights, duties, or obligations of each party in a dispute, but does not necessarily award any damages or other relief.\n[2] A declaratory judgment, also called a declaration, is the legal determination of a court that resolves legal uncertainty for the litigants.\n[3] A declaratory judgment, sometimes called declaratory relief, is conclusive and legally binding as to the present and future rights of the parties involved. The parties involved in a declaratory judgment may not later seek another court resolution of the same legal issue unless they appeal the judgment.\n[4] A declaratory judgment is one which simply declares the rights of the parties, or expresser, the opinion of the court on a. question of law, without ordering anything to be done.\n[5] A ruling by a court (or, less commonly, a regulator) that resolves a dispute but does not order an action. That is, a declaratory judgment states a fact. For example, a declaratory judgment may state who owns a patent or a piece of property.\n[6] Adj. 1. declaratory-relating to the use of or having the nature of a declaration. asserting, declarative. interrogatory, interrogative-relating to the use of or having the nature of an interrogation.

However, a declaratory judgment does not order any action or result in any award of damages to any party to the case.\n[8] The declaratory judgment is generally considered a statutory remedy and not an equitable remedy in the United States, and is thus not subject to equitable requirements, though there are analogies that can be found in the remedies granted by courts of equity.\n[9] A declaratory judgment does not provide for any enforcement, however. In other words, it states the court's authoritative opinion regarding the exact nature of the legal matter without requiring the parties to do anything.\n[10] 9.3 Declaratory Judgment Act. The Declaratory Judgment Act offers a unique mechanism by which advocates may seek to remedy ongoing violations of statutory or constitutional provisions. The Act may authorize broad-based declaratory and injunctive relief without resort to class action procedures.\n[11] An insurance company, for example, might seek a declaratory judgment as to whether a policy applies to a certain person or event. Declaratory judgments also commonly involve individuals or parties who seek to determine their rights under specific regulatory or criminal laws.\n[12] Common law. 1 Consent judgment: a consent judgment is available where the parties agree on the terms of the judgment or order that should be made. 2 Declaratory judgment: a declaratory judgment can be made by the courts regardless of whether a remedy is being claimed.\n[13] The unique feature of the Declaratory Judgment Act is its authorization to \"declare\" the rights and legal relations of the parties to the controversy; such declarations have the force and effect of a final judgment.\n[14] Nolo's Plain-English Law Dictionary. A court decision in a civil case that tells the parties what their rights and responsibilities are, without awarding damages or ordering them to do anything. Courts are usually reluctant to hear declaratory judgment cases, preferring to wait until there has been a measurable loss. But especially in cases involving important constitutional rights, courts will step in to clarify the legal landscape.\n[15] Instead, the judge, after analyzing the controversy, simply issues an opinion declaring the rights of each of the parties involved. A declaratory judgment may only be granted in justiciable controversies\u2014that is, in actual, rather than hypothetical, controversies that fall within a court's jurisdiction.\n[16] In an exempt organization action, only the organiza-. tion may be a petitioner. (14) ''Declaratory judgment'' is the decision of the Court. in a retirement plan action, a gift valuation action, a gov-. ernmental obligation action, an estate tax installment pay-. ment action, or an exempt organization action.\n[17] \"Case or Controversy\" and Jurisdictional Requirements. A party seeking declaratory relief under the statute must present an \"actual controversy\" in order to satisfy the \"case or controversy\" requirement of Article III. The Declaratory Judgment Act was not intended as a device for rendering mere advisory opinions. The case must involve a controversy that is substantial and concrete, must touch the legal relations of parties with adverse interests, and must be subject to specific relief through a decree of conclusive character.\n[18] The Court also observed that \"declaratory judgment jurisdiction will not arise merely on the. basis that a party learns of the existence of a patent owned by another or even perceives such a. patent to pose a risk of infringement, without some affirmative act by the patentee.\" Id. at. 1381.\n[19] (b) For Defending Party. A party against whom a claim, counterclaim, or cross-claim is asserted or a declaratory judgment is sought may, at any time, move with or without supporting affidavits for a summary judgment in his favor as to all or any part thereof. (c) Motion and Proceedings Thereon.\n[20] An action or proceeding is not open to objection on the ground that a declaratory judgment or decree is prayed for.

Source: Flickr/Dana Spiegel. Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are both methods that provide wireless communication, but the difference between the two mainly stems from what they are designed to do and how they are used. The main difference is that Bluetooth is primarily used to connect devices without using cables, while Wi-Fi provides high-speed access to the internet. Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard that is used to exchange data over short distances (less than 30 feet), usually between personal mobile devices.\n[2] Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are to some extent complementary in their applications and usage. Wi-Fi is usually access point-centered, with an asymmetrical client-server connection with all traffic routed through the access point, while Bluetooth is usually symmetrical, between two Bluetooth devices.\n[3] Bluetooth and WiFi are different standards for wireless communication. Bluetooth technology is useful when transferring information between two or more devices that are near each other when speed is not an issue, such as telephones, printers, modems and headsets.\n[4] Stockbyte/Stockbyte/Getty Images. Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are both wireless networking technologies. They transmit information via radio signals broadcast through the air rather than over wires, allowing devices to communicate with each other and share information.\n[5] Bluetooth or Wi-Fi: what's the difference? Here's the biggest difference: With Bluetooth, you stream music from your phone to a speaker. A Wi-Fi speaker accesses music from the internet, or from a computer on your home network. You can control a Wi-Fi speaker with your smartphone. You just have to stay within range of your Wi-Fi router's signal.\n[6] Bluetooth vs. WiFi - Range: Maximum range for Bluetooth based wireless connections is 30m while for Wi-Fi, it can extend well upto 100m. In Wi-Fi, range depends on the version of Wi-Fi protocol applied and addition of antennas in the communication system while no such concerns of range or extra antenna are much known in Bluetooth. . Bluetooth vs. WiFi - Devices Connected: In Bluetooth, upto 7 devices can be connected to each other (piconet) while in Wi-Fi, the maximum connections depend on Wi-Fi router which can accommodate 1 to several communicating devices at a time.\n[7] The choice of Bluetooth or WiFi is clear. Bluetooth is a universal standard and easy to use. But, its range is quite limited and sound quality is restricted. WiFi systems have a wider range and can offer excellent fidelity. But, different systems that use WiFi are incompatible, and setup may be difficult.\n[8] Wi-Fi is used for creating wireless local area networks, linking devices within about 100 meters of a central wireless access point. Bluetooth has a much smaller range and is used to create personal area networks of devices that are within about 10 meters of each other.\n[9] Bluetooth 4.0 vs. Wi-Fi Direct: Speed. Wi-Fi Direct promises device-to-device transfer speeds of up to 250Mbps, while Bluetooth 4.0 promises speeds similar to Bluetooth 3.0 of up to 25Mbps. Both Bluetooth 4.0 and Wi-Fi Direct use the 802.11 networking standard to reach their maximum speeds.\n[10] Bluetooth 4.0 vs. Wi-Fi Direct: Speed Wi-Fi Direct promises device-to-device transfer speeds of up to 250Mbps, while Bluetooth 4.0 promises speeds similar to Bluetooth 3.0 of up to 25Mbps. Both Bluetooth 4.0 and Wi-Fi Direct use the 802.11 networking standard to reach their maximum speeds.\n[11] Bluetooth and Wi-Fi (the brand name for products using IEEE 802.11 standards) have some similar applications: setting up networks, printing, or transferring files. Wi-Fi is intended as a replacement for high speed cabling for general local area network access in work areas.\n[12] Also like WiFi, Bluetooth is \"fairly\" secure. Unlike WiFi, tethering via Bluetooth isn't all that common. Sure, people do it, but it's a little more involved to set up than WiFi, and a little more involved every time you want to use Bluetooth tethering. If power consumption is a concern, Bluetooth is probably the way to go, if you're willing to configure it.\n[13] ZigBee is more economical than Wi-Fi while Bluetooth protocol also consumes more energy and has a greater scattering of parameters of conventionally compatible units. This is caused by the fact that Bluetooth does not have a unified data transfer standard.\n[14] Bluetooth basically does the same thing a USB cable connection does, but it is a wireless connection to your printer, modem, and other peripherals. Bluetooth is a technology that allows voice and data connections between a wide range of mobile and stationary devices through short-range digital two-way radio. 1 Cellphone and PC manufacturers may enhance their Bluetooth product offerings with support for its low-energy wireless technology.\n[15] IEEE 802.11 working group standards like 802.11h and 802.11j are extensions or offshoots of Wi-Fi technology that each serve a very specific purpose. Bluetooth is an alternative wireless network technology that followed a different development path than the 802.11 family.\n[16] WiFi has a greater range than Bluetooth \u2013 perhaps as much as 120 feet indoors, but the actual range may be less. With some planning, WiFi can cover an entire house. One way to assure maximum coverage is to locate the WiFi router in the center of a house, or where its coverage is most useful.\n[17] I use a separate usb wifi adapter. I heard that bluetooth and wifi work the same way. Just want to know if it will apply to this or not. WiFi LAN communication protocol is completely different and is used when high speeds are required and communication distances are much further.\n[18] No brainer here. Wi-Fi Direct offers speeds of up to 250Mbps while Bluetooth 4.0 lags behind at a paltry-seeming 25Mbps. While I'm somewhat skeptical that it'll come close to the touted maximum speed, there's no doubt it's significantly faster than the current Bluetooth High Speed standard.\n[19] Bluetooth 4.0 is using AES 128-bit encryption, while Wi-Fi Direct relies on WPA2 security, which uses AES 256-bit encryption. Both forms use key-based encryption and authentication methods, and both offer enough security for the average consumer.\n[20] Wireless vs Bluetooth Headphones Both these types of headphones are wireless i.e. they do not use wires of any form to connect to a device. But the main difference between wireless and bluetooth headphones is their range. A wireless headset can receive signals from up to a distance of 100 feet (30 meters). On the contrary, Bluetooth headphones are designed for devices at a distance of up to 30 feet (9 meters).

Its density is the lowest of any chemical element, 0.08999 grams per liter. By comparison, a liter of air weighs 1.29 grams, 14 times as much as a liter of hydrogen. Hydrogen changes from a gas to a liquid at a temperature of -252.77\u00b0C (-422.99\u00b0F) and from a liquid to a solid at a temperature of -259.2\u00b0C (-434.6\u00b0F). It is slightly soluble in water, alcohol, and a few other common liquids.\n[7] At STP (standard temperature and pressure) hydrogen is a gas. It cools to a liquid at -423 \u00b0F, which is only about 37 degrees above absolute zero. Eleven degrees cooler, at \u2026 -434 \u00b0F, it starts to solidify.\n[8] Hydrogen can exist as a liquid under high pressure and an extremely low temperature of 20.28 kelvin (\u2212252.87\u00b0C, \u2212423.17 \u00b0F). Hydrogen is often stored in this way as liquid hydrogen takes up less space than hydrogen in its normal gas form. Liquid hydrogen is also used as a rocket fuel.ydrogen is found in large amounts in giant gas planets and stars, it plays a key role in powering stars through fusion reactions. Hydrogen is one of two important elements found in water (H 2 O). Each molecule of water is made up of two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom.\n[9] Confidence votes 11.4K. At STP (standard temperature and pressure) hydrogen is a gas. It cools to a liquid at -423 \u00b0F, which is only about 37 degrees above absolute zero. Eleven degrees cooler, at -434 \u00b0F, it starts to solidify.\n[10] Answer The boiling point of liquid hydrogen is 20.268 K (-252.88 \u00b0C or -423.184 \u00b0F) The freezing point of hydrogen is 14.025 K (-259.125 \u00b0C or -434.\n[11] Liquid hydrogen or slush hydrogen may be used, as in the Space Shuttle. However liquid hydrogen requires cryogenic storage and boils around 20.268 K (\u2212252.882 \u00b0C or \u2212423.188 \u00b0F). Hence, its liquefaction imposes a large energy loss (as energy is needed to cool it down to that temperature).\n[12] Rating Newest Oldest.

Hydrogen has a liquidation point of 423.17 degrees below zero F.\n[16] Hydrogen's state of matter is gas at standard conditions of temperature and pressure. Hydrogen condenses into a liquid or freezes solid at extremely cold... Hydrogen's state of matter is gas at standard conditions of temperature and pressure. Hydrogen condenses into a liquid or freezes solid at extremely cold temperatures. Hydrogen's state of matter can change when the temperature changes, becoming a liquid at temperatures between minus 423.18 and minus 434.49 degrees Fahrenheit. It becomes a solid at temperatures below minus 434.49 F.Due to its high flammability, hydrogen gas is commonly used in combustion reactions, such as in rocket and automobile fuels.\n[17] Hydrogen occurs as a gas that you can't see and can't smell. It is about 14 times lighter than air. When you combine two atoms of hydrogen with one atom of oxygen you get a water molecule H 2O. Like nitrogen, hydrogen can also be condensed to a liquid that freezes at \u2013 259\u00b0C (-434\u00b0F) and boils at -252\u00b0C (-423\u00b0F).

Due to the close proximity of organs in the abdominal and pelvic cavity, it is not always possible to isolate a specific organ when pain occurs at a particular region. Therefore the most common conditions of the nearest organs to this area needs to be considered. Pain may arise from the hip joint itself or the pelvic bone but there are also other possible conditions as discussed below. Abdominal wall pain is one of the common but often neglected causes of right hip pain. The pain may arise with trauma to the abdominal wall or with muscle strain. The pain is typically superficial and aggravated with movement or touch.\n[3] Some of the possible common medical causes of Pelvic pain may include: 1 Pelvic abscess. 2 Ovarian cyst. 3 Ovarian cancer. 4 Endometriosis. 5 Sequelae of acute PID. 6 Chronis pancreatitis. 7 Renal calculi. 8 Inflammatory bowel disease. 9 Irritable bowel syndrome. 10 Microscopic colitis. 11 Left renal vein entrapment. 12 Muscular infection.\n[4] Causes of Pelvic pain. Pelvic pain has numerous causes, may be mild or severe and include: pelvic inflammatory disease, ovarian cysts/polycystic ovarian syndrome, endometriosis, adenomyosis, fibroids, ectopic pregnancy, appendicitis, bladder/kidney infection, irritable bowel syndrome and diverticulitis.1 Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).elvic pain has numerous causes, may be mild or severe and include: pelvic inflammatory disease, ovarian cysts/polycystic ovarian syndrome, endometriosis, adenomyosis, fibroids, ectopic pregnancy, appendicitis, bladder/kidney infection, irritable bowel syndrome and diverticulitis. 1 Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).\n[5] Possible causes of pelvic pain in both men and women may include: 1 Appendicitis. 2 Bladder disorders. 3 Sexually transmitted diseases. 4 Kidney infection or kidney stones. 5 Intestinal disorders. 6 Nerve conditions. 7 Hernia. 8 Pelvis disorder. 9 Broken pelvis. 10 Psychogenic pain.\n[6] Some of the less common causes of Pelvic pain may include: 1 Fibroids. 2 Radiculitis. 3 Lyme disease. 4 Abdominal cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome. 5 Tabes dorsalis. 6 Hepatitis.\n[7] Possible causes of pelvic pain in both men and women may include: 1 Appendicitis. 2 Bladder disorders. 3 Sexually transmitted diseases. 4 Kidney infection or kidney stones. 5 Intestinal disorders. 6 Nerve conditions. 7 Hernia. 8 Pelvis disorder.\n[8] But all back pain, whether it is your right lower back pain now, or any back pain issue, comes from 4 main factors - tight muscles, weak muscles, joint movement and pelvic balance. With right lower back pain both the link between the Sacrum and the Pelvis is the most likely cause. The imbalances in the pelvis create tension on the Sacro-Iliac joint and hence pain occurs. To ease this pain and build strength ion the area you need to use technqiues that work well and quickly.\n[9] Other causes in women or men Examples of other possible causes of pelvic pain \u2014 in women or men \u2014 include: 1 Appendicitis. 2 Colon cancer. 3 Chronic constipation. 4 Crohn's disease. 5 Diverticulitis. 6 Fibromyalgia. 7 Inguinal hernia. 8 Interstitial cystitis (also called painful bladder syndrome).\n[10] Causes of Pelvic Pain. Acute pelvic pain is pain that starts over a short period of time anywhere from a few minutes to a few days. This type of pain is often a warning sign that something is wrong and should be evaluated promptly. Pelvic pain can be caused by an infection or inflammation. An infection doesn't have to affect the reproductive organs to cause pelvic pain. Pain caused by the bladder, bowel, or appendix can produce pain in the pelvic region; diverticulitis, irritable bowel syndrome, kidney or bladder stones, as well as muscle spasms or strains are some examples of non-reproductive causes of pelvic or lower abdominal pain.\n[11] Possible causes of pelvic pain in women only may include: 1 Ectopic pregnancy. 2 Miscarriage. 3 Pelvic inflammatory disease. 4 Ovulation. 5 Menstrual cramps. 6 Ovarian cysts or other ovarian disorders. 7 Fibroids. 8 Endometriosis.\n[12] Other causes in women or men Examples of other possible causes of pelvic pain \u2014 in women or men \u2014 include: 1 Appendicitis. 2 Colon cancer. 3 Chronic constipation. 4 Crohn's disease. 5 Diverticulitis.\n[13] Causes of Pain on the Right Side of the Waist. Pain along the waist line may be caused by abnormal function of any of the organs in the pelvic region of the body. Depending on the cause of the problem, waist pain might be mild or severe, aching or throbbing. Sitting and sleeping in improper position may lead to the pain located on the right side of the waist.\n[14] In women, pelvic pain may be caused by: 1 Endometriosis, a condition in which the tissue that normally lines the uterus grows on the ovaries, bladder or other organs. 2 Chronic pelvic inflammatory disease, an infection that affects the female reproductive organs. 3 Fibroids, which are noncancerous tumors that grow in the uterus.\n[15] Some causes of chronic pelvic pain include: 1 Endometriosis. This is a condition in which tissue from the lining of your womb (uterus) grows outside your uterus. 2 Tension in your pelvic floor muscles. Spasms or tension in the pelvic floor muscles can lead to recurring pelvic pain. 3 Chronic pelvic inflammatory disease.\n[16] Other causes in women or men Examples of other possible causes of pelvic pain \u2014 in women or men \u2014 include: 1 Appendicitis. 2 Colon cancer. 3 Chronic constipation. 4 Crohn's disease.5 Diverticulitis. 6 Fibromyalgia. 7 Inguinal hernia. 8 Interstitial cystitis (also called painful bladder syndrome).ther causes in women or men Examples of other possible causes of pelvic pain \u2014 in women or men \u2014 include: 1 Appendicitis. 2 Colon cancer. 3 Chronic constipation. 4 Crohn's disease.\n[17] Some causes of acute pelvic pain include: 1 An infection of your uterus, fallopian tubes, or ovaries; this condition is called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). 2 An infection of the urethra, bladder, or kidneys. 3 Ovarian cysts - may go away on their own or may need to be surgically removed. Ectopic pregnancy.\n[18] The most common urgent causes of pelvic pain are pelvic inflammatory disease, ruptured ovarian cyst, and appendicitis; however, many other diagnoses in the differential may mimic these conditions, and imaging is often needed.\n[19] Disorders that can cause pelvic pain include. 1 Gynecologic disorders\u2014those that affect the reproductive organs (vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries) 2 Disorders that affect other organs in the pelvis, such as the bladder, rectum, or appendix.\n[20] Some women develop serious complications during pregnancy that cause different types of pain.

Several species of shark and tuna have something special going on inside their bodies. For a long time, scientists have known that some fish species appear warm-blooded. Salmon sharks can elevate their body temperatures by up to 20 degrees compared to the surrounding water, for example.\n[2] Most sharks are cold-blooded. Some, like the Mako and the Great white shark, are partially warmblooded (they are endotherms). Cold blooded although if you've ever seen a Great White Shark hunt sea lions you'd be thinking they would have to be hotblooded. Actually the Salmon Shark is a warm blooded shark.\n[3] Most sharks are cold-blooded. Some, like the Mako and the Great white shark, are partially warmblooded (they are endotherms).

Actually the Salmon Shark is a warm blooded shark.\n[5] Great white sharks are some of the only warm blooded sharks. This allows them to swim in colder waters in addition to warm, tropical waters. Great White sharks can be found as\u2026 north as Alaska and as south as the southern tip of South America. They exist worldwide, everywhere in-between. 5 people found this useful.\n[6] Are White Sharks warm-blooded or cold-blooded? White sharks are part of the fish family, so they must be 'cold-blooded', right? Actually, white sharks are much more complex than you may think. An animal that is 'cold-blooded' means their inside body temperature is dependent on the environment they are in. For example, a snake is cold blooded, so its body temperature fluctuates with the day or even whether or not they are in the sun.\n[7] More on Warm-Bodied Sharks. Shortfin Mako (Isurus oxyrinchus) A question came across SHARK-L concerning makos being considered warm-blooded and various replies touch upon aspects of the topic. I responded to the original query and went onto expand upon or correct some of those responses.\n[8] Some fish are ectothermic such as the Blue shark whereas others are endothermic such as swordfish and Lamnid sharks.ndothermic = warm-blooded Ectothermic = cold-blooded Endotherms are able to maintain their own body temperature, whereas Ectotherms rely on their environment to regulate body \u2026 temperature.\n[9] Are sharks cold-blooded or warm-blooded? Sharks have a reputation as \"cold-blooded killers\" and despite how negative that term is, it's not entirely inaccurate. Sharks are by no means evil, vicious killers like that quote suggests. Nonetheless, sharks are, for the most part anyways, efficient ectothermic predators. Endo vs Ecto.\n[10] For many people, sharks are the epitome of the 'cold-blooded killer'. The warm-bodied mackerel sharks are spectacular reminders that many of our stereotypes are inaccurate. As apex predators, sharks are absolutely essential to the health and vigor of marine ecosystems.\n[11] Regardless sharks are cold blooded, they live either in warm, temperate and cold waters. Some species live mainly in cold waters, while some others prefer warmer waters. SHARK MIGRATION. One thing is for sure; sharks migrate to find new sources of food and they can travel up to hundreds of miles to do that. Most species of sharks live in the oceans. However, some of them are known to dwell in bodies of freshwater, like the bull shark which travels up to 4,000 Km up the Amazon River. Sometimes, sharks reach freshwater bodies; this could be the result of the destruction of their habitat by human activities.\n[12] A question came across SHARK-L concerning makos being considered warm-blooded and various replies touch upon aspects of the topic. There are currently two species of mako recognized, the Longfin (Isurus paucus) and the Shortfin (I. oxyrinchus).\n[13] Certain lamnid sharks, tuna and billfishes are also endothermic. In common parlance, endotherms are characterized as warm-blooded .. The opposite of endothermy is ectothermy, although there is no absolute or clear separation between the nature of endotherms and ectotherms in general.\n[14] White sharks are part of the fish family, so they must be 'cold-blooded', right? Actually, white sharks are much more complex than you may think. An animal that is 'cold-blooded' means their inside body temperature is dependent on the environment they are in. For example, a snake is cold blooded, so its body temperature fluctuates with the day or even whether or not they are in the sun.\n[15] These sharks are unique in their ability to elevate and maintain body temperatures as much as 13 C above the ambient water temperature. One striking feature of these warm-bodied sharks is that their flanks and viscera are warm, while the heart and gills are at environmental temperatures.\n[16] The Salmon Shark is one of the warmest of the warm-bodied sharks. Measurements of its epaxial (upper back) muscles indicate that this species is able to maintain a body temperature 14 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit (8 to 11 degrees Celsius) above the ambient water temperature.\n[17] The Largest Great White Sharks. Great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) are huge and powerful warm-blooded fish that have been around for at least 11 million years. Also known as white pointers, their ancestors existed on Earth 400 million years ago, which is 200 million years before the first dinosaur appeared.\n[18] Meet the Comical Opah, the Only Truly Warm-Blooded Fish. There's nothing about the opah that says \"fast-moving predator\". Tuna, sharks, and swordfish are fast-moving predators and accordingly, their bodies look like streamlined torpedoes. By contrast, the opah looks like a big startled frisbee, with thin red fins stuck on as an afterthought.\n[19] Most large sharks are cold-blooded and cruise at a leisurely 1.5 mph. Because most species fare poorly in captivity, the maximum swimming speed of a shark has seldom been measured. The Blue Shark is an open ocean glider, planing on wing-like pectoral fins and flattened belly.\n[20] They could be either predators (e.g. Killer whale) or filter feeders.

The length of the midsegment is the sum of the two bases divided by 2. Remember that the bases of a trapezoid are the two parallel sides. To find angles within a trapezoid, remember that since there are two sides are parallel, the other sides can be seen as transversals, forming corresponding angles and same side interior angles.\n[4] The midsegment of a trapezoid is referred to as the median or the midline. The length of the midsegment is calculated by finding the average length of each of the parallel sides. The formula for this length is the sum of the length of side A plus the length of side B, divided by two. The midsegment is also used to calculate the area of a trapezoid. Learn more about Shapes.\n[5] The midpoint of the red segment pictured on the left is the point (A, 2b).

A parallelogram has central 2-fold rotational symmetry (or point reflection symmetry). There is some disagreement whether parallelograms, which have two pairs of parallel sides, should be regarded as trapezoids.\n[12] Extended Conjecture: (Trapezoid Midsegment Conjecture): The midsegment of a trapezoid is parallel to the bases and is equal in length to the average of the lengths of the two bases. Explanation: A midsegment of a trapezoid is a segment that connects the midpoints of the two non-parallel sides of a trapezoid. This segment has two special properties. It is parallel to the bases of the trapezoid. The length of the midsegment is the average of the lengths of the two bases. Remember that the bases of a trapezoid are parallel. Key Curriculum Press can provide demo versions of Geometer's Sketch Pad.\n[13] The midsegment of a trapezoid has two special properties: 1 The midsegment of a trapezoid is parallel to each base. 2 The length of the midsegment of a trapezoid is equal to half the sum of the lengths of its bases.\n[14] The side of the triangle that the midsegment does not intersect is the base of the triangle. The midsegment of a trapezoid is the segment formed by connecting the midpoints of the two legs of a trapezoid. Although the midsegment of a trapezoid is also useful in mathematics, we will not discuss it here.\n[15] The segment that connects the midpoints of the legs of a trapezoid is called the midsegment. This segment's length is always equal to one-half the sum of the trapezoid's bases, or. Consider trapezoid ABCD shown below.\n[16] The top and bottom sides of the trapezoid run parallel to each other, so they are the trapezoid's bases. The other sides of the trapezoid will intersect if extended, so they are the trapezoid's legs. The segment that connects the midpoints of the legs of a trapezoid is called the midsegment.\n[17] According to this theorem mid segment of a trapezoid is equal to half of sum of its two parallel sides. In triangle ABC M is mid point of AB and P is midpoint of AC. so MP is mid segment of triangle ABC. similarly just apply this rule in triangle ACD the PN is midsegment of triangle ACD.\n[18] This segment's length is always equal to one-half the sum of the trapezoid's bases, or. Consider trapezoid ABCD shown below. The midsegment, EF, which is shown in red, has a length of. The measurement of the midsegment is only dependent on the length of the trapezoid's bases.\n[19] The opposite sides of a trapezoid that are parallel to each other are called bases. The remaining sides of the trapezoid, which intersect at some point if extended, are called the legs of the trapezoid. The top and bottom sides of the trapezoid run parallel to each other, so they are the trapezoid's bases. The other sides of the trapezoid will intersect if extended, so they are the trapezoid's legs. The segment that connects the midpoints of the legs of a trapezoid is called the midsegment.\n[20] In a regular n-gon, the sum of the measures of the exterior angles is ___.

Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: difference between a mcdouble and a double cheeseburger.\n\n[1] There is a discernible difference between the two burgers, especially in the meat quality. The McDouble contains gristle and carry's a different flavor than the Double Cheeseburger. The double cheeseburger tastes more like beef. The McDouble tastes of whatever meat filler they use to fill the gap.\n[2] A double cheesburger has 2 slices of cheese with 2 meat patties. A mcdouble on the other hand only had 1 slice of cheese, but still 2 pieces of meat. I say had because mcdoubles arent sold in Australia (maybe a few stores but not a regular menu item) anymore. Other countries might be different but that's the difference in Australia.\n[3] At first glance, the double cheeseburger looks a lot like the McDouble, but it is not exactly the same thing. The main difference that you will notice is the amount of cheese that is on this sandwich. There are two slices of cheese on the double cheeseburger instead of just the one slice of cheese that comes on the McDouble. Even though it comes with two slices of cheese, it still has the onions, pickles, ketchup and mustard that come on the other burgers.\n[4] The McDouble is listed as a slice of American cheese between two 100% beef patties, topped with pickles, onions, ketchup and mustard. mcdonalds.com. The Double Cheeseburger is listed as two slices of golden American cheese with two 100% all beef patties, pickles, onions, ketchup and mustard.\n[5] Although we previously reported that the McDouble would be on the Dollar Menu, in Manhattan the cheeseburger appears on the Dollar Menu while the McDouble is $1.39 and the double cheeseburger is $1.49.\n[6] So whenever the McDouble hit the Dollar Menu and the Double Cheeseburger was thrown into the \"Burgers\" section at $1.19 or even higher ($1.29 in most places now), the average consumer scratched their head, winced their eyes, and fell over in a wrath of confusion and bewilderment.\n[7] The Double Cheeseburger is priced at $1.49 and my Triple Cheeseburger was priced at $2.19. I just don't understand the point of paying 70-cents for an extra burger patty when you can just get two McDoubles for $2.00. Obviously the value of the Triple Cheeseburger makes no sense when you're comparing menu items.\n[8] But I did it for you. With McDonald's recent release of the McDouble, they now have three basic, sub-$2 cheeseburgers: the cheeseburger, McDouble (two patties with one slice of cheese), and double cheeseburger (two patties with two slices of cheese).\n[9] Review: Triple Cheeseburger from McDonald's. When it comes to the various sizes of classic McDonald's cheeseburgers, the prices might have you scratching your head. The price differences between a McDonald's Cheeseburger, the beefier McDouble and the cheesier Double Cheeseburger now all fall within 50-cents of one another.\n[10] The difference is that the Mighty Kid's Meal provides more food than what is typically found in a Happy Meal, providing a McDouble (a cheeseburger consisting of two patties and one slice of cheese) instead of a cheeseburger or a hamburger, and more Chicken McNuggets (6 versus 4), plus a larger drink (16oz vs 12oz).\n[11] The Double Cheesburger is now $1.19 instead of a buck. Seriously, $.19/slice of cheese and a removal from the Dollar Menu. Do I order the Double Cheeseburger at its new full price or do I stick to the Dollar Menu and go with the McDouble. Of course, I go with the McDouble. One piece of McCheese might be better than two pieces of McCheese. I guess McDonalds thinks people like me who bought the Double Cheeseburger for a buck will pony up and pay the extra pennies. Sooner or later they will be charging for extra napkins and ketchup.\n[12] Review: McDonald's - Daily Double. 1 McDonald's Daily Double is a new Extra Value Menu item and McDouble variant featuring two beef patties, a slice of American cheese, slivered onions, a thick slice of tomato, shredded lettuce, and mayo on a plain toasted hamburger bun. It's not nearly a value as the McDouble as it carries a price tag of $1.99.\n[13] It also comes in sandwich form with mayo for the same price. On the burger front, McDo has the Cheeseburger Deluxe (the Mac!) which is a cheeseburger with lettuce, cheese, and mayo at a relatively pricey (in comparison) 52 pesos ($1.17). You can also get the Double Cheeseburger Deluxe for 87 pesos ($1.96!)\n[14] Meatier and cheesier. Double Cheeseburger.

Here's a tip that not everyone knows... a McDouble from the McDonalds Dollar menu is the same thing as a Double Cheeseburger-well, minus one piece of cheese (and a lot of cents).\n[16] For those not in the know, a Land, Air, and Sea Burger is a Big Mac, McChicken, and Filet-O-Fish all slammed together.

The basal ganglia is responsible for submitting messages to the body to help coordinate and control movements. When it's damaged, voluntary movements are compromised, resulting in spasticity and other abnormal movements.\n[16] Some children have symptoms of more than one type of cerebral palsy.

RSA is a public-key cryptosystem for both encryption and authentication; it was invented in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman [RSA78]. It works as follows: take two large primes, p and q, and find their product n = pq ; n is called the modulus.\n[10] RSA is a cryptosystem for public-key encryption, and is widely used for securing sensitive data, particularly when being sent over an insecure network such as the Internet.

RSA key is a private key based on RSA algorithm. Private Key is used for authentication and a symmetric key exchange during establishment of an SSL/TLS session. It is a part of the public key infrastructure that is generally used in case of SSL certificates.\n[13] THE CRYPTOGRAPHY GUIDE: RSA. RSA RSA is a public key algorithm invented by Rivest, Shamir and Adleman. The key used for encryption is different from (but related to) the key used for decryption.The algorithm is based on modular exponentiation.hen talking of key lengths in connection with RSA, what is meant is the modulus length. An algorithm that uses different keys for encryption and decryption is said to be asymmetric. Anybody knowing the public key can use it to create encrypted messages, but only the owner of the secret key can decrypt them.\n[14] Rivest, Shamir, and Adelman (RSA) is a public-key cryptographic system used for authentication. IKE on the Cisco router or PIX Firewall uses a D-H exchange to determine secret keys on each IPSec peer used by encryption algorithms. The D-H exchange can be authenticated with RSA signatures or preshared keys.\n[15] The RSA system is the most commonly used encryption and authentication algorithm, and is included as a part of Cisco IOS. To use the RSA system, a network host generates a pair of keys. One is called the public key, and the other is called the private key. The Public key is given to anyone who wants to send encrypted data to the host. The Private key is never shared.\n[16] This is also called public key cryptography, because one of them can be given to everyone. The other key must be kept private. It is based on the fact that finding the factors of a integer is hard (the factoring problem). RSA stands for Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman, who first publicly described it in 1978.\n[17] 2.

Mechanical ventilation: Use of a machine called a ventilator or respirator to improve the exchange of air between the lungs and the atmosphere. Last Editorial Review: 5/13/2016.\n[2] Mechanical ventilation is the medical term for artificial ventilation where mechanical means is used to assist or replace spontaneous breathing.\n[3] Mechanical ventilation. For the use in architecture and climate control, see Ventilation (architecture). Mechanical ventilation is the medical term for artificial ventilation where mechanical means is used to assist or replace spontaneous breathing.\n[4] Mechanical ventilation is a life support treatment. A mechanical. ventilator is a machine that helps people breathe when they are not. able to breathe enough on their own. The mechanical ventilator is. also called a ventilator, respirator, or breathing machine. Most. patients who need support from a ventilator because of a severe. illness are cared for in a hospital's intensive care unit (ICU).\n[5] Mechanical ventilation is the use of a mechanical device (machine) to inflate and deflate the lungs. Mechanical ventilation provides the force needed to deliver air to the lungs in a patient whose own ventilatory abilities are diminished or lost. Breathing requires the movement of air into and out of the lungs. This is normally accomplished by the diaphragm and chest muscles. A variety of medical conditions can impair the ability of these muscles to accomplish this task, including: muscular dystrophies.\n[6] Mechanical ventilation. Assisted ventilation could be defined as the movement of gas into and out of lungs by an external source connected directly to the patient. The external source could be the resuscitation bag, continuous distending pressure device or a mechanical ventilator.\n[7] Nasotracheal intubation In medicine, mechanical ventilation is a method to mechanically assist or replace spontaneous breathing. Mechanical ventilation is typically used after an invasive intubation, a procedure wherein an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube is inserted into the airway.\n[8] What Is Mechanical Ventilation? Mechanical ventilation, in the healthcare setting or home, helps patients breathe by assisting the inhalation of oxygen into the lungs and the exhalation of carbon dioxide. Depending on the patient's condition, mechanical ventilation can help support or completely control breathing.\n[9] 1. Continuous mandatory ventilation. 2. A mode of mechanical respiration in which all breaths are mandatory and are either patient or machine triggered, and machine cycled; a minimum breathing rate is set but the patient can trigger breaths at a faster pace.\n[10] Ventilators are medical devices that provide mechanical ventilation to assist with or replace patients' spontaneous breathing. Mechanical ventilation is often categorized based on the interface used, such as a tracheostomy tube for invasive ventilation, or a mask for non-invasive ventilation.\n[11] Mechanical ventilation may be defined as the use of a mechanical device to provide. ventilator support for patients. There are 2 types of mechanical ventilation: positive and. negative pressure ventilation. Positive pressure ventilation delivers a positive pressure to. inflate the lungs. Expiration is passive.\n[12] Mechanical ventilation, in the healthcare setting or home, helps patients breathe by assisting the inhalation of oxygen into the lungs and the exhalation of carbon dioxide. Depending on the patient's condition, mechanical ventilation can help support or completely control breathing.\n[13] Mechanical ventilation is indicated when the patient's spontaneous ventilation is inadequate to maintain life. It is also indicated as prophylaxis for imminent collapse of other physiologic functions, or ineffective gas exchange in the lungs.his may involve a machine called a ventilator or the breathing may be assisted by a registered nurse, physician, physician assistant, respiratory therapist, paramedic, or other suitable person compressing a bag or set of bellows.\n[14] What Is Mechanical Ventilation? Mechanical ventilation, in the healthcare setting or home, helps patients breathe by assisting the inhalation of oxygen into the lungs and the exhalation of carbon dioxide.Depending on the patient's condition, mechanical ventilation can help support or completely control breathing.oncerns how much inspiratory or \"trigger\" effort is required from the ventilator to recognize that the patient is trying to inhale; this can refer to a ventilator setting, but can also be used to describe the ventilator's responsiveness to the patient's breathing effort. Flow of breaths.\n[15] Mechanical ventilation is indicated when the patient's spontaneous ventilation is inadequate to maintain life. It is also indicated as prophylaxis for imminent collapse of other physiologic functions, or ineffective gas exchange in the lungs.\n[16] Mechanical ventilation is the movement of air through the workspace caused by an electrical device, such as a portable fan or permanently mounted fan in the ceiling or wall. The minimum flow rate shall be 2,000 cfm per welder, except where local exhaust hoods and booths or airline respirators are provided and used.\n[17] Mechanical ventilation is indicated when the patient's spontaneous ventilation is inadequate to sustain life. In addition, it is indicated as a measure to control ventilation in critically ill patients and as prophylaxis for impending collapse of other physiologic functions. second possible advantage of this mode of mechanical ventilation is that cycling the ventilator into the inspiratory phase maintains normal ventilatory activity and, therefore, prevents atrophy of the respiratory muscles.\n[18] Mechanical ventilation is termed invasive if it involves any instrument penetrating through the mouth (such as an endo tracheal tube) or the skin (such as a tracheostomy tube).his may involve a machine called a ventilator or the breathing may be assisted by a registered nurse, physician, physician assistant, respiratory therapist, paramedic, or other suitable person compressing a bag or set of bellows.\n[19] Mechanical Ventilation. Mechanical ventilation is a method of forced or induced ventilation by using mechanical air handling systems, commonly called HVAC systems. Mechanical ventilation is more controllable than natural ventilation. In Mechanical Ventilation blowers, fans, filters, and ducts are used for transporting and removing air from a space.There are two types of fans used for the transmission of air. When the air enters the impellers axially and is discharged radially from the impeller, it is called a centrifugal or radial flow fan.t is the movement of air from one space to other as well as supply of fresh air into the air conditioned space. Mechanical ventilation assists in controlling the humidity, contaminants, air borne particles, and general air quality.\n[20] MECHANICAL / FORCED VENTILATION. A building ventilation system that uses powered fans or blowers to provide fresh air to rooms when the natural forces of air pressure and gravity are not enough to circulate air through a building.echanical ventilation is used to control indoor air quality, excess humidity, odours, and contaminants can often be controlled via dilution or replacement with outside air. However, in humid climates specialised ventilation systems can remove excess moisture from the air.\nSearch Query: medicare's definition of mechanical ventilation.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Monotonic functions are the functions which maintained the order of functions value. As we all know that the variation in independent value also make the variation in functions value. A suitable example for this is monotonic functions or linear polynomials. The monotonic functions maintains the straight line in linear programming graph. This is also called the monotonic nature over the domain and real numbers. A monotonic function increases and decreases over the interval.\n[2] Montonic Function. When a function is increasing on its entire domain or decreasing on its entire domain, we say that the function is strictly monotonic, and we call it a monotonic function. For example, consider the function g(x) equals x 3: Notice the graph of g is increasing everywhere. Therefore, this is a monotonic function.\n[3] To solidify our understanding of what a monotonic function is, let's consider what a non-monotonic function is. A non-monotonic function is a function that is increasing and decreasing on different intervals of its domain. For example, consider our initial example f(x) equals x 2.\n[4] Monotonic Function. A monotonic function is a function which is either entirely nonincreasing or nondecreasing. A function is monotonic if its first derivative (which need not be continuous) does not change sign.\n[5] monotonic function. Monotonic Function. (or monotone function), a function whose increments \u0394f(x) = f(x\u2032) \u2212 f(x) do not change sign when \u0394x = x\u2032 \u2212 x > 0; that is, the increments are either always nonnegative or always nonpositive. Somewhat inaccurately, a monotonic function can be defined as a function that always varies in the same direction.\n[6] In mathematics, a monotonic function (or monotone function) is a function between ordered sets that preserves or reverses the given order. This concept first arose in calculus, and was later generalized to the more abstract setting of order theory. 1 Monotonicity in calculus and analysis.\n[7] The MONOTONIC function is an undocumented SAS function. It needs no input parameters and if any input parameters are provided, these are ingnored. The function counts the number of times it is called and returns an ascending sequence of integers, starting at 1.\n[8] The MONOTONIC function is often presented as a means of adding sequence numbers to table rows. Several papers present it as a solution to this programming problem. If the MONOTONIC function is used in an SQL procedure that aggregates data then the function may return non-sequential or missing results.\n[9] The MONOTONIC function is often presented as a means of adding sequence numbers to table rows. Several papers present it as a solution to this programming problem. However, the function is undocumented and has some limitations, including:\n[10] An important application of monotonic functions is in probability theory. If is a random variable, its cumulative distribution function is a monotonically increasing function. A function is unimodal if it is monotonically increasing up to some point (the mode) and then monotonically decreasing. When is a strictly monotonic function, then is injective on its domain, and if is the range of, then there is an inverse function on for.\n[11] Here's the definition of the monotonic function from Wikipedia: In calculus, a function f defined on a subset of the real numbers with real values is called monotonic (also monotonically increasing, increasing or non-decreasing), if for all x and y such that x \u2264 y one has f(x) \u2264 f(y), so f preserves the order.\n[12] In calculus, a function defined on a subset of the real numbers with real values is called monotonic if and only if it is either entirely increasing or decreasing. It is called monotonically increasing (also increasing or nondecreasing), if for all and such that one has, so preserves the order (see Figure 1).\n[13] In calculus, a function defined on a subset of the real numbers with real values is called monotonic if and only if it is either entirely increasing or decreasing. It is called monotonically increasing (also increasing or nondecreasing), if for all and such that one has, so preserves the order (see Figure 1). Likewise, a function is called monotonically decreasing (also decreasing or nonincreasing) if, whenever, then, so it reverses the order (see Figure 2).\n[14] The textbook says it's a way of transforming a set of numbers into another set that preserves the order. But I don't understand what that means. Here are a few examples. The question was: do these functions represent a monotonic transformation. u = 2v - 13 (yes) u = -1/v2 (no) u = ln(v) (yes) u = v2 (no)\n[15] The term monotonic may also be used to describe set functions which map subsets of the domain to non-decreasing values of the codomain. In particular, if is a set function from a collection of sets to an ordered set , then is said to be monotone if whenever as elements of , .\n[16] In calculus, a function f {\\displaystyle f} defined on a subset of the real numbers with real values is called monotonic if and only if it is either entirely increasing or decreasing.\n[17] In calculus, a function defined on a subset of the real numbers with real values is called monotonic if and only if it is either entirely increasing or decreasing. It is called monotonically increasing (also increasing or nondecreasing), if for all and such that one has, so preserves the order (see Figure 1).Likewise, a function is called monotonically decreasing (also decreasing or nonincreasing) if, whenever, then, so it reverses the order (see Figure 2).If the order in the definition of monotonicity is replaced by the strict order, then one obtains a stronger requirement.A function with this property is called strictly increasing. Again, by inverting the order symbol, one finds a corresponding concept called strictly decreasing.wo facts about these functions are: 1 if is a monotonic function defined on an interval, then is differentiable almost everywhere on, i.e. the set of numbers in such that is not differentiable in has Lebesgue measure zero.\n[18] Figure 1. A monotonically increasing function (it is strictly increasing on the left and right while just non-decreasing in the middle.). Figure 2. A monotonically decreasing function. In calculus, a function f defined on a subset of the real numbers with real values is called monotonic (also monotonically increasing, increasing or non-decreasing), if for all x and y such that x \u2264 y one has f (x) \u2264 f (y), so f preserves the order (see Figure 1).\n[19] Likewise, a function is called monotonically decreasing (also decreasing or non-increasing) if, whenever x \u2264 y, then f (x) \u2265 f (y), so it reverses the order (see Figure 2). If the order \u2264 in the definition of Monotonicity is replaced by the strict order strictly increasing.\n[20] Note that just monotonic transformation of a concave function isnot necessarily concave: consider, for example f (x) = x and g (z) = z 3 .Thus the concavity of a function is not ordinal, it is cardinal property.Economic ExampleSuppose production function f (x) is concave and the cost function c (x) is convex.ote that just monotonic transformation of a concave function isnot necessarily concave: consider, for example f (x) = x and g (z) = z 3 .Thus the concavity of a function is not ordinal, it is cardinal property.Economic ExampleSuppose production function f (x) is concave and the cost function c (x) is convex.\nSearch Query: example of monotonic function.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Substance use is involved in many of these suicides. The 2010 report of the Army Suicide Prevention Task Force found that 29 percent of active duty Army suicides from fiscal year (FY) 2005 to FY 2009 involved alcohol or drug use; and in 2009, prescription drugs were involved in almost one third of them.\n[9] List Notes: Data is top 5 causes of death in the United States military for the year 2012-2013.

'If you went and checked the lakes and ponds across the country you could probably find a goldfish about Bob's size, but having one in a tank like this is most unusual and I have not heard of one.\n[2] Goldfish Only Grow to the Size of Their Enclosure. There is an element of truth to this, but it is not as innocent as it sounds and is related more to water quality than tank size. When properly cared for, goldfish will not stop growing.\n[3] Goldfish Only Grow to the Size of Their Enclosure. There is an element of truth to this, but it is not as innocent as it sounds and is related more to water quality than tank size. When properly cared for, goldfish will not stop growing. Most fishes are in fact what are known as indeterminate growers.\n[4] A goldfish will grow to the depth of the water it is kept in. If the tank is not large enough to allow the goldfish to grow, it's growth will be stunted and this can cause the fish to become unhealthy and die.\n[5] A Goldfish will grow quicker if you increase its metabolism slightly. This can be done by keeping the water at summer temperatures of around 65F to 70F. Goldfish kept at this higher temp will also need added space (2 gals per inch of fish), air bubbles and a really good filtration system.\n[6] A goldfish will grow to the depth of the water it is kept in. If the tank is not large enough to allow the goldfish to grow, it's growth will be stunted and this can cause the fish to become unhealthy and die. The fancy goldfish do not get as large as the common/comet/shubunkin/feeder goldfish.\n[7] Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: Goldfish do not grow to the size of their tank, that is a myth. Goldfish grow until they are at their mature size, but being in a tank too small for them to grow properly can cause stunting. This is where the idea that they grow to the size of their tank comes from.\n[8] In clean, uncrowded conditions in tanks or ponds, goldfish grow fast. They can grow to a few inches (1 to 4 inches) within the first year. It really depends on their genetics and living situation. It may take a year or two before they change color from brown to gold or whatever color their parents were.\n[9] Report Abuse. Fish do not grow to the size of their tank, that is a wrong. Goldfish grow until they are at their mature size, but being in a small tank for them to grow can cause stunting. This is the idea that they grow to the size of their tank comes from.\n[10] Depending on his type and his environment, goldfish have the capacity to grow anywhere from around 6 to 15 inches within a very short period of time. If they are kept in tiny aquariums or little bowls, they will still grow, but much more slowly. Those conditions are somewhat cramped for the fish and that will show in ...\n[11] Goldfish growth rates can be massive for their first few weeks after hatching in a perfect growing environment, as much as a 50% or more increase in body length in a week. Goldfish growth rates are totally dependent on the conditions they are kept in, and the amount of high quality food they receive.\n[12] Giant Goldfish: Popular Housepet Can Grow Monstrously Large, As Tahoe Catch Shows. By On 02/25/13 AT 5:04 PM. Last week, scientists netted a 4-pound, 1.5-foot-long goldfish in Lake Tahoe. The scientists also found 15 other goldfish, indicating they're probably reproducing in the lake high in the Sierra Nevada.\n[13] Giant Goldfish: Popular Housepet Can Grow Monstrously Large, As Tahoe Catch Shows. Last week, scientists netted a 4-pound, 1.5-foot-long goldfish in Lake Tahoe. The scientists also found 15 other goldfish, indicating they're probably reproducing in the lake high in the Sierra Nevada.\n[14] The best way to get goldfish to grow the fastest is you give them as much room as you can then you give them growth food from the store. You can find it at almost any store that sells fish food. This will ensure that it will grow fast and big. blackheart_21 \u00b7 7 years ago.\n[15] I read somewhere totally scientific that goldfish will grow to a size commensurate with the size of their environment. So what if I filled a swimming pool with fresh water and all the bells and whistles they need to survive: filters, feeders, temperature regulators, aerators and what not, would I end up with dog-sized goldfish?\n[16] Big Fish in a Small Pond. To grow a big goldfish in a small pond, breeders focus on two main factors: food and temperature, according to Tropical Fish Data, a database on tropical fish.\n[17] If the tank is not large enough to allow the goldfish to grow, it's growth will be stunted and this can cause the fish to become unhealthy and die. The fancy goldfish do not get as large as the common/comet/shubunkin/feeder goldfish. The more room you can give your goldfish, the faster it will grow.\n[18] A goldfish can grow up to 12 inches(30cm) plus. The minimum size pond is 8 feet X 6 feet and 3 feet deep(2.5m X 2m X 1m). The larger the pond the better for your goldfish. Being tempted to economise, some people end up building 2 or 3 ponds to get to the desired size.\n[19] A: The conditions goldfish are kept in plus their diet determine how large they will grow. I have seen goldfish grow ridiculously large in very small containers when their water was changed frequently. Goldfish will not grow if water conditions are poor. Fancy goldfish don't grow as large as Common goldfish. A good size would be around 5 inches body length for most fancy varieties, 8 inches for Comets and 12 inches for Common Goldfish. These sizes are usually only attained by pond grown fish.\n[20] pond goldfish like comets, shubunkins, and wakins can grow well over 12inches. fancier varieties like ranchus,lionhead,and orandas can grow over 10 inches. other fancy varieties like ryukins,black moors, fantails, etc. can grow over 6-7 inches. The largest goldfish recorded is over 16 inches.\nSearch Query: do goldfish grow.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

I'm the first to admit that sous-vide is not the best way to cook everything, and that goes for the majority of my favorite vegetables. Peas, asparagus, ramps\u2014all those delicious, fresh spring flavors do better with a quick blanch or a saut\u00e9. That said, there are some vegetables for which sous-vide cooking can't be beat. For me, carrots top that list. When cooked in a sealed bag with a little bit of butter, sugar, and salt, the natural flavor of the carrot intensifies into a sweeter, stronger, and downright tastier version of itself.\n[10] Sous-vide is a method of cooking food sealed in airtight plastic bags in a water bath for longer than normal cooking times\u201472 hours in some cases\u2014at an accurately regulated temperature much lower than normally used for cooking, typically around 55 \u00b0C to 60 \u00b0C for meats and higher for vegetables.\n[11] The term s ous vide (pronounced soo\u2013veed) is a French term, meaning under vacuum. Sous vide is a culinary technique in which vacuum-sealed food is immersed in a water bath and cooked at a very precise, consistent temperature.\n[12] Sous vide recipes. Sous vide recipes. From the French for 'under vacuum', sous vide is a method of cooking where ingredients are sealed in an airtight bag and submerged in a water bath. This method not only ensures a constant cooking temperature, but allows the food to cook for long periods of time without losing any of its flavour or moisture.\n[13] Sous vide is a culinary technique in which vacuum-sealed food is immersed in a water bath and cooked at a very precise, consistent temperature. This cooking technique typically involves cooking food for longer periods of time at a lower temperature.\n[14] Steak is one of the most popular foods to cook for first-time sous-vide enthusiasts, and with good reason. Cooking steak in a skillet or on the grill the traditional way leaves lots of room for error and an over- or undercooked steak is a big mistake to make when there's a Prime-grade dry-aged ribeye on the line.\n[15] Sous-vide is a method of cooking in which food is vacuum-sealed in a plastic pouch or a glass jar and then placed in a water bath or steam environment for longer than normal cooking times at an accurately regulated temperature. The temperature is much lower than normally used for cooking, typically around 55 to 60 \u00b0C for meat, higher for vegetables. The intent is to cook the item evenly, ensuring that the inside is properly cooked without overcooking the outside, and to retain moisture.\n[16] Beef Index Beef Pork Poultry Fish Misc. Beef is highly recommended for Sous Vide. You can produce some astonishing results with chewy and tough cuts like for instance brisket. Beef must not exceed 60 degrees c.

Related Psychology Terms axon terminal\n[12] The dendrites don't have terminating knobs at the end of it. The axons are what conduct action potentials away from the cell body. The axon is not an axon because it's long, it's an axon because of the existence of synaptic knobs at the axon terminals. When the axon conducts action potentials away from the cell body and the signal goes to the synaptic knob, it's going to release a neurotransmitter in response to the electrical signal.\n[13] An axon terminal is the structure of a neuron (a single cell of the central or peripheral nervous system) at the end of it's axon that forms a synapse with another neuron.

Alternative splicing allows for the production of various protein isoforms from one single gene coding.\n[14] Exons. Exons are the nucleotide sequences of genes that are expressed, and those are found at either sides of an intron. In simple terms, it could be stated that exons really hit the ground in the expression of genes or in the protein synthesis.The polypeptide strand is formed based on the nucleotide sequence in exons. Exons are found at the two ends of a gene while introns are always found inside the gene. \u2022 When mutations take place, introns sometimes contribute nucleotides but usually not the other way around. \u2022 Both DNA and RNA contain introns and exons, but mature RNA only contain exons and not the introns.\n[15] ex\u00b7on.

Left ventricular hypertrophy can occur when some factor makes your heart work harder than normal to pump blood to your body. Factors that can cause your heart to work harder include: High blood pressure (hypertension). This is the most common cause of left ventricular hypertrophy. More than one-third of people show evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy at the time of their diagnosis with hypertension.\n[2] Left ventricular hypertrophy can occur when some factor makes your heart work harder than normal to pump blood to your body. Factors that can cause your heart to work harder include: High blood pressure (hypertension). This is the most common cause of left ventricular hypertrophy. More than one-third of people show evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy at the time of their diagnosis with hypertension. Aortic valve stenosis.\n[3] Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) occurs when the muscle tissue in the heart's main pumping chamber becomes enlarged. LVH is often caused by high blood pressure or other heart problems and can lead to serious complications, such as heart disease, heart attack and heart failure.\n[4] Left ventricular hypertrophy is a thickening of the wall of the heart's main pumping chamber. This thickening may result in elevation of pressure within the heart and sometimes poor pumping action. The most common cause is high blood pressure.\n[5] Left ventricular hypertrophy may cause or facilitate many cardiac complications of hypertension, including congestive heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and sudden death. Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, which may present with all of the symptoms and signs of congestive heart failure, is common in patients with long-standing hypertension.\n[6] Left ventricular hypertrophy is enlargement and thickening (hypertrophy) of the walls of your heart's main pumping chamber (left ventricle). Left ventricular hypertrophy can develop in response to some factor \u2014 such as high blood pressure or a heart condition \u2014 that causes the left ventricle to work harder. As the workload increases, the muscle tissue in the chamber wall thickens, and sometimes the size of the chamber itself also increases.\n[7] Left ventricular hypertrophy can develop in response to some factor \u2014 such as high blood pressure or a heart condition \u2014 that causes the left ventricle to work harder. As the workload increases, the muscle tissue in the chamber wall thickens, and sometimes the size of the chamber itself also increases.\n[8] Left ventricular hypertrophy is thought to be the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in the adult population. This is most commonly the result of longstanding high blood pressure which has caused secondary damage to the wall of the main pumping chamber of the heart, the left ventricle.\n[9] Chamber Hypertrophy and Enlargment. In hypertrophy the heart muscle becomes thicker. This can have different causes. Left ventricular hypertrophy results from an increase in left ventricular workload, e.g., during hypertension or aortic valve stenosis. Right ventricular hypertrophy results from an increase in right ventricular workload, e.g., emphysema or pulmonary embolization. These causes are fundamentally different from hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HCM), which is a congenital misalignment of cardiomyocytes, resulting in hypertrophy.\n[10] See the Mayo Clinic webpage Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). It's the thickening of the muscle of the left ventricle, usually because pumping against a higher resistance (hypertension, aortic valve defects) or as part of a hereditary heart muscle disease (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). It's correlated with more heart failure, more heart attacks, more deaths.\n[11] Several underlying conditions can contribute to or influence the enlargement of the heart muscle in the left ventricle. Hypertension is the most common cause, setting the stage for left ventricular hypertrophy once a person's blood pressure exceeds the normal level of 140/90 mm Hg. Aside from hypertension, the condition known as aortic valve stenosis is also a common cause of the hypertrophic changes in the heart.\n[12] Over time, this can cause the heart muscle to thicken. As the heart pumps against elevated pressure in the blood vessels, the left ventricle becomes enlarged and the amount of blood pumped by the heart each minute (cardiac output) goes down, a condition called left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Without treatment, this can lead to heart failure.\n[13] Left ventricular hypertrophy can occur as an inborn disease in infants and children, due to an underlying condition known as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or HCM is a hereditary disease that involves an inborn abnormality of the cardiac muscles.\n[14] Factors that can cause your heart to work harder include: 1 High blood pressure (hypertension). This is the most common cause of left ventricular hypertrophy. More than one-third of people show evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy at the time of their diagnosis with hypertension. Aortic valve stenosis.\n[15] Left Ventricular Hypertrophy. Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH) causes a similar pattern of repolarization abnormalities as LBBB, with ST elevation in the leads with deep S-waves (usually V1-3) and ST depression/T-wave inversion in the leads with tall R waves (I, aVL, V5-6).\n[16] Patients who present with a thickened left ventricle are likely suffering from left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). There are a few different causes of LVH. It is a strong indicator of potential coronary complications, and there is a strong correlation between certain types of LVH and morbidity and mortality.\n[17] High blood pressure may also bring on heart failure by causing left ventricular hypertrophy, a thickening of the heart muscle that results in less effective muscle relaxation between heart beats. This makes it difficult for the heart to fill with enough blood to supply the body's organs, especially during exercise, leading your body to hold onto fluids and your heart rate to increase.\n[18] Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is serious when the muscle is very thick (max thickness >3 cm), or if the increased muscle mass is impeding blood flow through the heart (defined as increased outflow pressure gradient).\n[19] Left ventricular hypertrophy that is caused by aortic valve stenosis might require surgery to repair the narrow valve or to replace it with an artificial or tissue valve. 1 Tests and diagnosis. 2 Lifestyle and home remedies.\n[20] Left ventricular hypertrophy that is caused by aortic valve stenosis might require surgery to repair the narrow valve or to replace it with an artificial or tissue valve.

Lanolin is often used in skin care products because of its ability to boost the natural moisture barrier, as well as the ability to draw moisture to the application site.\n[2] Theraderm is a manufacturer of clinical-grade skin care products, including anti-aging creams and moisturizers, as well as an acne system under an alternate brand: Reversion. The company was founded in 1996 by James Beckman, M.D., and is headquartered in Springdale, Arkansas.\n[3] Theraderm Skin Renewal System. Theraderm Skin Renewal System is described as a total skincare system that may produce younger looking skin. This 5-product system is said to reduce fine lines, take care of rough skin and address sun damage. However, this system has received some low scores on consumer-driven websites that rate anti-aging products, which makes us wonder if this system does not live up to expectations.\n[4] Curaderm BEC5 Eggplant Extract cream known as Curaderm for the alternate treatment of skin cancers such as Basal Cell Carcinoma, Squamous Cell Carcinoma. Curaderm is the Eggplant Skin Cancer Treatment By Dr Bill Cham for non-melanoma skin cancers and Actinic Keratosis.\n[5] Phenol red is commonly used as a pH indicator in carbohydrate fermentation tests because most of the end-products of carbohydrate utilization are organic acids (8). However, other pH indicators such as bromocresol/bromcresol purple (BCP), bromothymol/bromthymol blue (BTB), and Andrade's can be used (See table 1).\n[6] In the case of Theraderm, this is taken even further, as the brand was founded by a plastic surgeon, Dr. James Beckman. However, even though this brand was created by a doctor, it doesn't mean that the products are the right choice for everyone.\n[7] Nowadays there are many skin care brands, like Theraderm, which are actively promoted by doctors and dermatologists. This is an interesting approach, because it boosts the image of the products through the associated skin care expertise of a doctor.\n[8] Thermoplastic is used for high traffic areas such as roadways, cross walks or entrances to parking lots due to its durability, crack resistance, skid resistance, and reflectivity for night visibility. ADA Guidelines \u2013 Handicap. In July 1990 the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) began affecting every property owner.\n[9] Skin patches are another type of ERT. Examples are Alora, Climara, Estraderm, and Vivelle-Dot. Combination estrogen and progestin patches -- like Climara Pro and Combipatch -- are also available. Menostar has a lower dose of estrogen than other patches, and it's only used for reducing the risk of osteoporosis.\n[10] Uses for thermoelectric materials . Thermoelectric materials are used in niche cooling applications, for example to maintain very stable temperatures in lasers and optical detectors, and they are often found in office water coolers. They are also used in space exploration to convert heat from a radioactive material into electricity.\n[11] Canadarm is used in the deployment of the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. The Shuttle arm is also used to support two spacewalks by astronauts Jerry Ross and Jerome Apt, for a total of 10 hours and 49 minutes.\n[12] What are fluoropolymers used for? Fluoropolymers are thermoplastics, which simply means that at some point energy (in most cases, heat, which is why the prefix thermo) is used to achieve the final form. Typical uses for fluoropolymers include wire insulation for computer networks, semi-conductor manufacturing equipment, and automotive fuel hoses.\n[13] Thermoplastics are used for packaging because they can be softened and reshaped as many times as the material can take. This is good, because then they can be recycled and the \u2026 plastic can be used again.\n[14] 1 The Canadarm was seen in the 2013 space-thriller film Gravity, shown as being used to repair the Hubble Space Telescope from a space shuttle. 2 On November 13, 2012, Google Canada displayed a doodle on its home search page to celebrate the 31st anniversary of the Canadarm's first use in space.his safety system allows the Orbiter's payload bay doors to be closed in the event that the arm fails in an extended position and is not able to be retracted. The Canadarm is 15.2 m (50 ft) long and 38 cm (15 in) diameter with six degrees of freedom.\n[15] The GIRM allows for the use of incense at Mass during the entrance procession, at the beginning of Mass to incense the altar, at the Gospel procession and proclamation, at the preparation of offerings, and at the showings of the Host and Chalice during the Eucharistic prayer.\n[16] CiviCRM is used by many large NGOs including Amnesty International, Creative Commons, the Free Software Foundation, and the Wikimedia Foundation for their fundraising. There are also cases of very large record sets being used with one company claiming to have set up CiviCRM with a set of over 3 million constituents.\n[17] The American Cancer Society does not recommend thermography as a replacement for mammograms. Thermography may be used to supplement information from a mammogram and help identify cancers that are close to the skin. Still, thermography can't find cancers that are deeper in the breast and it can't detect small cancers.\n[18] Thermoset plastics significantly improve the material's mechanical properties, providing enhances chemical resistance, heat resistance and structural integrity. Thermoset plastics are often used for sealed products due to their resistance to deformation.\n[19] The thermocouple is useful as a thermometer for measuring very high temperatures in places where people cannot go, such as inside a kiln or a blast furnace. Also, since the thermocouple creates electricity, it can be connected to a computer to record the temperature.\n[20] Thermofax screens are perfect for printing finely detailed images onto fabric, paper and many other surfaces.

The trachea is divided into a cervical part situated in the ventral region of the neck, and a thoracic part inside the thorax.\n[4] Tracheid of oak shows pits along the walls. It is longer than a vessel element and has no perforation plates. Tracheids are elongated cells in the xylem of vascular plants that serve in the transport of water and mineral salts.Tracheids are one of two types of tracheary elements, vessel elements being the other. Tracheids, unlike vessel elements, do not have perforation plates.racheids provide most of the structural support in softwoods, where they are the major cell type. Because tracheids have a much higher surface to volume ratio compared to vessel elements, they serve to hold water against gravity (by adhesion) when transpiration is not occurring.\n[5] Its major components include xylem parenchyma, xylem fibers, tracheids, and xylem vessels. Tracheids are one of the two types of tracheary elements of vascular plants. (The other being the vessel elements). A tracheid cell loses its protoplast at maturity.

As you probably know the theory of plate tectonics posits the outer layer of the Earth consist of plates which move relative to each other driven by convection in the Mantle.\n[2] Active continental margin: A continental margin that has a very narrow, or even nonexistent, continental shelf and a narrow and steep continental slope that ends in a deep trench instead of a continental rise; it is marked by earthquake and volcanic activity.\n[3] An active continental margin refers to the submerged edge of a continent overriding an oceanic lithosphere at a convergent plate boundary by opposition with a passive continental margin which is the remaining scar at the edge of a continent following continental break-up.\n[4] Active Margins. occur where oceanic lithosphere is being subducted beneath the edge of the continent. the result is a relatively narrow margin that consists of highly deformed sediment that was scraped from the decending lithospheric slab and plastered against the margin of the overriding continent.\n[5] An active plate margin is an actual plate boundary, where oceanic crust and continental crust crash into each other. Active plate margins are often the site of earthquakes and volcanoes. Oceanic crust created by seafloor spreading in the East Pacific Rise, for instance, may become part of the Ring of Fire, the horseshoe-shaped pattern of volcanoes and earthquake zones around the Pacific ocean basin.\n[6] Passive margin. A passive margin is the transition between oceanic and continental lithosphere that is not an active plate margin. A passive margin forms by sedimentation above an ancient rift, now marked by transitional lithosphere. Continental rifting creates new ocean basins.\n[7] An active continental margin is found on the leading edge of the continent where it is crashing into an oceanic plate. An excellent example is the west coast of South America. Active margins are commonly the sites of tectonic activity: earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain building, and the formation of new igneous rock.\n[8] The continental margins along India and Antarctica are other examples of passive margins. A continental margin that has a very narrow, or even nonexistent, continental shelf and a narrow and steep continental slope is known as an active continental margin. Instead of ending in a continental rise, the continental slope of this type of margin often plunges into a deep-ocean trench, which may be filled with sediment.\n[9] Active Margins. occur where oceanic lithosphere is being subducted beneath the edge of the continent. the result is a relatively narrow margin that consists of highly deformed sediment that was scraped from the decending lithospheric slab and plastered against the margin of the overriding continent.ame thing as oceanic ridge. Long well developed divergent plate boundary, sea floor is elevated forming a broad line swell called the ocean ridge. knowledge of the ridge comes from soundings of the ocean floor and floor samples from deep sea drilling, visual inspections from deep submersibles.\n[10] Making the world better, one answer at a time. Passive continental margins are not areas of convergence. There is little volcanic and earthquake activity on passive margins. Active margins are areas of convergence where one plate is descending beneath another. They are associated with volcanic and earthquake activity.\n[11] The overall rate may be extremely slow (one to ten centimeters per year), but the long term effect is a continual re-shaping of the surface of our planet. An active continental margin is found on the leading edge of the continent where it is crashing into an oceanic plate. An excellent example is the west coast of South America. Active margins are commonly the sites of tectonic activity: earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain building, and the formation of new igneous rock.\n[12] Active continental margins, i.e., when an oceanic plate subducts beneath a continent, represent about two-thirds of the modern convergent margins. Their cumulated length has been estimated to 45,000 km (Lallemand et al.,\n[13] Two types of continental margins exist: active margins and passive margins. Active margins form primarily along the boundaries of plates that are actively converging. Passive margins currently exist in the middle of plates, not at plate boundaries.\n[14] Active continental margins form primarily along the boundaries of plates that are actively converging and where one plate is sinking beneath the other. Active margins mark the continents that border the Pacific Ocean where oceanic plates are subducting beneath continental plates.assive continental margin: A continental margin that has a broad continental shelf, a gentle continental slope, and a pronounced continental rise; it is marked by a lack of earthquake and volcanic activity. Plates: Large sections of Earth's lithosphere separated by deep fault zones.\n[15] best answer an active continental margin is found on the leading edge of the continent where it is crashing into an oceanic platean excellent example is the west coast of south americaactive margins are commonly the sites of tectonic activity earthquakes volcanoes mountain building and the formation of new igneous rockn excellent example is the west coast of south america active margins are commonly the sites of tectonic activity earthquakes volcanoes mountain building and the formation of new igneous rock\n[16] A continental margin that has a broad continental shelf, a gentle continental slope, and a pronounced continental rise is known as a passive continental margin. This type of margin experiences little, if any, volcanic or earthquake activity. The build-up of sediment is the primary activity affecting a passive margin.\n[17] Passive plate margins endure very little constructive or destructive movement. Active plate margins describe subduction zones and other boundaries where movement is regular and common. Cause of earthquakes.\n[18] Both passive and active continental margins are located near coastlines. The main difference is that active margins are the main sites where tectonic activity takes place (lik \u2026 e earthquakes). This is because the continental shelf of active continental margins collide with an oceanic plate, creating subduction.\n[19] rating newest oldest best answer an active continental margin is found on the leading edge of the continent where it is crashing into an oceanic plate an excellent example is the west coast of south americaactive margins are commonly the sites of tectonic activity earthquakes volcanoes mountain building and the formation of new igneous rockn excellent example is the west coast of south america active margins are commonly the sites of tectonic activity earthquakes volcanoes mountain building and the formation of new igneous rock\n[20] Passive continental margin: A continental margin that has a broad continental shelf, a gentle continental slope, and a pronounced continental rise; it is marked by a lack of earthquake and volcanic activity.

This will also reduce soil erosion and make rainwater infiltrate into the soil more than on land plowed along the slope. Terraces are more effective than contour plowing alone in minimizing soil erosion and facilitating infiltration f rainfall into the soil.\n[2] 2016-09-28T08:13:26-04:00. Farmers can reduce soil erosion by contour plowing. The correct option among all the options that are given in the question is the second option or option B. The other choices given in the question are incorrect and can be neglected. I hope that this is the answer that has actually come to your desired help.\n[3] Contour plowing is the act of farming on a hill or a contoured area. The plow follows the contours of the land horizontally helping to reduce runoff of water. This practice helps to prevent soil erosion in hilly and contoured areas by capturing the water runoff using water breaks to keep water contained. Contour plowing is also known as contour farming, and is a sustainable form of agriculture.\n[4] Both contour plowing and terrace farming are suitable for cultivating lands on sloping hills. Both are used to reduce soil erosion from tilled fields on slopes. In terrace farming, physical barriers (trenches, stone bunds, live hedges, or natural strips) are created along the contours to retain rain water and make it infiltrate into the soil and to minimize soil erosion.\n[5] A: Contour plowing conserves soil by following the lay of the land and creating ridges that form a water break to prevent soil erosion. Furrows that do not follow the lay of the land cause rapid runoff during rainfall by forming a convenient channel for the water to flow downhill.\n[6] Contour plowing Contour ploughing or contour farming is the farming practice of ploughing and/or planting across a slope following its elevation contour lines. These contour lines create a water break which reduces the formation of rills and gullies during times of heavy water run-off; which is a major cause of top soil loss and soil erosion.\n[7] Contour plowing. Contour ploughing or contour farming is the farming practice of ploughing and/or planting across a slope following its elevation contour lines. These contour lines create a water break which reduces the formation of rills and gullies during times of heavy water run-off; which is a major cause of top soil loss and soil erosion.\n[8] Contour plowing. Contour plowing or contour farming or Contour bunding is the farming practice of plowing and/or planting across a slope following its elevation contour lines. These contour lines create a water break which reduces the formation of rills and gullies during times of heavy water run-off; which is a major cause of soil erosion.\n[9] Contour plowing was a method of plowing furrows that follow the curves of the land rather than straight up and down slopes. Furrows that run up and down a slope form a channel that can quickly carry away seeds and topsoil. Contour plowing forms ridges, slows the water flow and helps save precious topsoil. LeRoy Hoffman rented farmland for his entire farming career and remembers when the government urged farmers to change their plowing methods.\n[10] Tilling the field at right angles to the natural slope after drawing up the elevation contour lines is called contour ploughing in soil, prevents and reduces soil erosion. Terrace Farming In terracing, wide steps are cut around the slopes of hills to prevent soil erosion.\n[11] Tilling the field at right angles to the natural slope after drawing up the elevation contour lines is called contour ploughing in soil, prevents and reduces soil erosion. Terrace Farming In terracing, wide steps are cut around the slopes of hills to prevent soil erosion. Contour ploughing follows the \"natural shape\" of the slope without altering it. Terrace farming alters the shape of the slope to produce flat areas that provide a catchment for water.\n[12] Contour bunding, Catalonia, 2007. Contour plowing (or contour ploughing) or contour farming is the farming practice of plowing across a slope following its elevation contour lines. The rows form slow water run-off during rainstorms to prevent soil erosion and allow the water time to settle into the soil.\n[13] 1. They plant shelter belts of trees to break the force of the wind 2. In dry areas, instead of plowing under the natural vegetation to plant crops, farmers graze animals on the vegetation 3. On gentle slopes, plowing along the natural contours of the land or planting crops in strips helps reduce water erosion 4.\n[14] Definition of contour plowing in US English - plowing along the contours of the land in order to minimize soil erosion. Definition of contour plowing in US English - plowing along the contours of the land in order to minimize soil erosion.\n[15] One of the earliest methods of conservation tillage came to be known as contour plowing, or plowing on the contour. Tilling the soil along the gentle slopes of a piece of cropland, instead of up and down the gradient, prevents fertile topsoil from being carried downhill by flowing rainwater.\n[16] Farmers can reduce soil erosion by___. A. increasing irrigation.. . B. contour plowing.. . C. grazing cattle on the land.. . D. plowing up roots. - 1851268\n[17] In contour ploughing, the ruts made by the plow run perpendicular rather than parallel to slopes, generally resulting in furrows that curve around the land and are level. This method is also known for preventing tillage erosion. Tillage erosion is the soil movement and erosion by tilling a given plot of land. A similar practice is contour bunding where stones are placed around the contours of slopes.\n[18] Contour plowing is also promoted in countries with similar rainfall patterns to the United States such as western Canada and Australia. The practice is effective only on slopes with between 2% and 10% gradient and when rainfall does not exceed a certain amount within a certain period.\n[19] Definitions for Contour plowing. Contour plowing. Contour ploughing or contour farming is the farming practice of ploughing and/or planting across a slope following its elevation contour lines.\n[20] Safeopedia explains Contour Plowing. Contour farming is done in hilly and sloped areas. Farmers who practice contour farming start by cutting levels into the hill or contoured area.
