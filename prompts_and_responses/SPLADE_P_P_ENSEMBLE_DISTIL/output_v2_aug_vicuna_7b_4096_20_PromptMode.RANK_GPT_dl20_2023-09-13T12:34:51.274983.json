Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: why do hunters pattern their shotguns?.\n\n[1] Why do hunters pattern their shotguns? 1. Understanding the Importance of Cartridge and Choke Performance. There's no difference between zeroing the rifle and patterning the shotgun. The process is both easy and beneficial. When hunting, it's important to adopt humane methods to capture the animal.\n[2] Why do hunters pattern their shotguns? to decide what animal to hunt to select ammunition with the best performance to compete against other hunters to identify the best shooting position to use in the field\n[3] This is called \"patterning your shotgun.\" All shotgun hunters need to pattern their firearms to determine which brands of shells, shot sizes, and loads perform best and at what range. A shotgun may have a good pattern (high density of hits), but shoot off target. If this is the case, you will need to have the stock adjusted by a gunsmith. \u2190 Previous\n[4] That's the reason why many hunters opt to test their shotguns and pattern it before intense hunting sessions. You wouldn't want to go in without knowing your gun well enough. Not only does this lessen the number of clean kills you can make, but it may also hurt something in the process due to inaccurate shooting.\n[5] You will also need to learn how to use the particular gun you have, particularly the shotgun. Do you know about patterning the shotgun? If you do, you probably wonder about why do hunters pattern their shotguns. While it does seem like a tedious task at first, it reaps a ton of benefits hunters love, which is what makes it an important thing to do.\n[6] First things first: the gun itself. A shotgun's primary purpose is hunting. Clearly, you can use this shotgun as a hunting weapon to \"restock\" on valuable calories. Humans can go for three weeks without food, but it's not fun. Lack of food leads to light-headedness, weakness, and poor decisions. In a survival situation, meat is the fastest and most effective way to replenish lost calories.\n[7] You now know what patterning a shotgun means, but why do hunters pattern their shotguns in the first place? When you shoot a shotgun while hunting, you want to make sure that you are familiarized with how it works, don't you?\n[8] The shot pellets from a shotgun spread upon leaving the barrel, and the power of the burning charge is divided among the pellets, which means that the energy of any one ball of shot is fairly low. In a hunting context, this makes shotguns useful primarily for hunting birds and other small game. backpacker shotgun has a short barrel and either a full-size stock or pistol grip, depending on legislation in intended markets. The overall length of these weapons is frequently less than 90 cm (35 in), with some measuring up at less than 63 cm (25 in).\n[9] Shotguns are the only firearm allowed for hunting game birds (except crow). Pistols, revolvers, rifles, and shotguns may be used to hunt crow. Bows, which include longbows, compound bows, and recurve bows, illuminated sights, scopes, quickpoint sights and hand-held string releasing mechanisms may be used. Atlatls.\n[10] The shotgun is probably the most versatile hunting weapon in the world. In a world where purpose specific shotguns sell for upwards of $2,000, a simple pump shotgun can \"get the job done\" for a fraction of that price. Don't get me wrong. There is a semi-auto Benelli duck gun on my wish list.\n[11] Shotgun Choke and Shot Pattern. 1 Cylinder choke is an unconstricted barrel. The shot pattern spreads quickly. 2 Improved Cylinder choke has a slight constriction. It allows the shot pattern to spread fairly quickly. This is a good choice for quail, rabbits, and other upland game. 3 Modified choke has moderate constriction.\n[12] If you choose to hunt with a shotgun, the recommended shot size if 5 or 6 on a shotgun with a 28\" or 30\" barrel length. Shotgun shells tend to be more expensive than other ammo, and they take up a lot of space in your gear. The large recoil may limit some smaller-built hunters in endurance as well.\n[13] Devoted to the use of muzzleloading shotguns for hunting, Trap, Skeet and other shooting sports. For most shooters, the phrase muzzle loader is synonymous with a muzzle loading rifle. However, there are a surprising number of shooters who, at least occasionally, shoot a muzzle loading shotgun.\n[14] Over 64,000 gun fans have descended on Las Vegas for the first major gun show of 2016 - and a triple barrel shotgun is among the new weapons on display at the Shooting, Hunting and Outdoor Trade Show. Called the Triple Crown, its maker Chiappa launched new models at the show. At first glance, it looks just like a normal shotgun - but actually has a third barrel above the traditional two. Scroll down for video. Called the Triple Crown, Chiappa says the rifle is perfect for both hunter as as a weapon for self defence.\n[15] SKU: 517793. Pro Hunter 4x32 Matte ProDiamond Shotgun (Box). ProDiamond reticle; waterproof, fogproof housing; weighs 8.6 ounces. Simmons' new Master Series ProHunter rifle and shotgun scopes will take your shooting performance to a new level.\n[16] A shotgun (also known as a scattergun and peppergun, or historically as a fowling piece) is a firearm that is usually designed to be fired from the shoulder, which uses the energy of a fixed shell to fire a number of small spherical pellets called shot, or a solid projectile called a slug. backpacker shotgun has a short barrel and either a full-size stock or pistol grip, depending on legislation in intended markets. The overall length of these weapons is frequently less than 90 cm (35 in), with some measuring up at less than 63 cm (25 in).\n[17] Select a shorter barrel shotgun such as one that is 20 inches long for use in home defense or personal protection. A shorter will be easier to handle and aim inside a home where walls and furniture must be considered.Choose a barrel length between 22 and 24 inches for shotguns to be used for turkey hunting.elect longer barrel shotguns, such as those with 30 inch barrels, for hunting ducks, geese or dove. Long range wing shots require a longer barrel and will produce better shot pattern results down range than a shorter barrel shotgun.\n[18] Reminder: Firearms registration is REQUIRED for all hunters who intend to participate in any upland game bird or spring turkey hunts. Use the form on the Registration page, and fax or mail it with a copy of your County registration for each shotgun you intend to use on PTA.\n[19] Shotgun choke is the constriction at the muzzle end of the gun that tightens the pattern of pellets. In an average cartridge there are approximately 300 pellets, so how wide the shot pattern or how restricted is a matter than will make all the difference to your shooting.\n[20] The hunting sport of wing shooting or \"shooting flying\" began in the 1600's after the French developed the flintlock action. In the following years, all over Europe, flintlock ignition, muzzle loading \"fowling pieces\" developed slowly. The development of the double barrel side by side muzzle loaded shotgun reached its zenith when in 1793, Joseph Manton set up his shop in London England. Manton's guns were light, trim, and well-balanced.\nSearch Query: why do hunters pattern their shotguns?.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

It helps the body produce energy.Acetyl-L-carnitine is used for a variety of mental disorders including Alzheimer's disease, age-related memory loss, late-life depression, thinking problems related to alcoholism, and thinking problems related to Lyme disease.cetyl-L-carnitine is an amino acid (a building block for proteins) that is naturally produced in the body. It helps the body produce energy.\n[2] Background. Carnitine is a naturally occurring hydrophilic amino acid derivative, produced endogenously in the kidneys and liver and derived from meat and dairy products in the diet.It plays an essential role in the transfer of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation.arnitine deficiency is a metabolic state in which carnitine concentrations in plasma and tissues are less than the levels required for normal function of the organism. Biologic effects of low carnitine levels may not be clinically significant until they reach less than 10-20% of normal.\n[3] Where it comes from: Carnitine (and L-carnitine) is a nutrient that helps the body break down fat and turn it into energy. It also increases the activity of certain nerve cells in the central nervous system. Carnitine is an amino acid naturally produced by the body in the liver and kidneys and stored in the skeletal muscles, heart, brain and sperm. The nutrient also occurs in fish, poultry, red meat and some types of dairy.\n[4] Carnitine, derived from an amino acid, is found in nearly all cells of the body. Its name is derived from the Latin carnus or flesh, as the compound was isolated from meat.Carnitine is the generic term for a number of compounds that include L-carnitine, acetyl-L-carnitine, and propionyl-L-carnitine [ 1-2 ].arnitine plays a critical role in energy production. It transports long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria so they can be oxidized (burned) to produce energy. It also transports the toxic compounds generated out of this cellular organelle to prevent their accumulation.\n[5] Carnitine biosynthesis and metabolism. Carnitine, a branched non-essential amino acid, is synthesized from the essential amino acids lysine and methionine. Ascorbic acid, ferrous iron, pyroxidine and niacin are also necessary cofactors (1) and deficiencies of any of these can lead to carnitine deficiency.\n[6] Carnitine, derived from an amino acid, is found in nearly all cells of the body. Its name is derived from the Latin carnus or flesh, as the compound was isolated from meat. Carnitine is the generic term for a number of compounds that include L-carnitine, acetyl-L-carnitine, and propionyl-L-carnitine [1-2]. Carnitine plays a critical role in energy production.\n[7] While it is often categorized as an amino acid, L-carnitine isn't technically an amino. It is considered a vitamin-like and amino acid-like compound that is related to the B vitamins. When it was first studied back in the 1950s, L-carnitine was referred to as vitamin BT. L-carnitine is formed in the liver and kidneys from the amino acids lysine and methionine. However, it is stored elsewhere in the body, primarily in muscle (including the heart), the brain, and even in sperm. In the diet, it mainly comes from meat and other animal products.\n[8] Carnitine is a substance found in almost every cell in the body, it is biosynthesized from the amino acids lysine and methionine. The compound plays a crucial role in energy production, as it is responsible for transporting fatty acids to the mitochondria.Mitochondria exist inside every cell in our bodies.arnitine is a substance found in almost every cell in the body, it is biosynthesized from the amino acids lysine and methionine. The compound plays a crucial role in energy production, as it is responsible for transporting fatty acids to the mitochondria. Mitochondria exist inside every cell in our bodies.\n[9] Acetyl L Carnitine is one of the more common formulations of L-Carnitine, which is itself an amino acid that is produced from two other amino acids (Lysine and Methionine). This version, or form, of L-Carnitine is significant more active than it parent compound due to a higher degree of bioavailability.\n[10] But before I get into the details of this flawed study, let's first take a closer look at carnitine and what it does in your body. The Transporter. L-carnitine, or just carnitine (the L refers to the configuration of the carnitine molecule that is biologically active) is often referred to as an amino acid, but it is not a true amino acid. Carnitine is an amino acid-like compound that is made in the body from the amino acids lysine and methionine. Its name is derived from the Greek word for flesh or meat, carnus. Not so coincidentally, it's abundant in red meat and dairy products, but it can also be found in various nuts, grains, and green vegetables.\n[11] Carnitine, derived from an amino acid, is found in nearly all cells of the body. Its name is derived from the Latin carnus or flesh, as the compound was isolated from meat. Carnitine is the generic term for a number of compounds that include L-carnitine, acetyl-L-carnitine, and propionyl-L-carnitine [1-2].\n[12] Nutrients for L-carnitine Production. Niacin, vitamin B-6 and iron increase metabolism by assisting with the production of L-carnitine, an amino acid that promotes fat burning, notes Vanderbilt University. Your body synthesizes L-carnitine from the essential amino acids lysine and methionine in the liver.\n[13] In this case, carnitine substitution (food supplementation) is certainly worthwhile. Carnitine is a biocarrier (transport substance), which is synthesised in the liver \u2013 and its precursor in the kidneys \u2013 from the two essential amino acids lysine and methionine.\n[14] L-carnitine is synthesized in the body from the amino acids lysine and methionine. Learn how your chances of success can increase with this in your arsenal. L-carnitine is synthesized in the body from the amino acids lysine and methionine.Regardless of what your bodybuilding and fitness goals are, losing fat or gaining muscle, your chances of success will increase greatly if you have l-carnitine in your supplement arsenal.-carnitine is synthesized in the body from the amino acids lysine and methionine. Learn how your chances of success can increase with this in your arsenal. L-carnitine is synthesized in the body from the amino acids lysine and methionine.\n[15] L-Lysine is one of 9 essential amino acids that cannot be made in the body. It is the basic raw material for carnitine synthesis. L-Proline can be made in the body but low protein/vegetarian diets may not promote optimal l-proline production.\n[16] L-Carnitine is an amino acid composite \u2013 one of the building blocks of protein. It is known to increase the number of androgen receptors in muscles. These receptors allow muscle to utilize testosterone resulting in an enhanced ability to build muscle.\n[17] Carnitine: What is it? Carnitine, derived from an amino acid, is found in nearly all cells of the body. Its name is derived from the Latin carnus or flesh, as the compound was isolated from meat.

Nonconformities are classified as either critical, major, or minor. In software engineering, ISO/IEC 9126 distinguishes between a defect and a nonconformity; a defect is the nonfulfilment of intended usage requirements, whereas a nonconformity is the nonfulfilment of a requirement. A similar distinction is made between validation and verification.\n[9] Nonconformity When igneous or metamorphic rocks are eroded and then covered by younger sedimentary rocks, the contact is called a nonconformity. One of the most famous of these is found in the Grand Canyon, where the oldest sedimentary rocks are more than a billion years younger than the 1.6 billion-year-old metamorphic rocks on which they rest.\n[10] Nonconformity: Nonconformity is the refusal to conform to accepted standards or rules. During the Puritans time it was common of all people to act the same way, believe in the same ideas, and follow the same rules. Today in pop-culture numerous people,literature, and poems show that being a nonconformist is a good thing.\n[11] An unconformity is a buried erosional or non-depositional surface separating two rock masses or strata of different ages, indicating that sediment deposition was not continuous. blended unconformity is a type of disconformity or nonconformity with no distinct separation plane or contact, sometimes consisting of soils, paleosols, or beds of pebbles derived from the underlying rock.\n[12] Definition of nonconformity. 1 1a : failure or refusal to conform to an established churchb often capitalized : the movement or principles of English Protestant dissentc often capitalized : the body of English Nonconformists. 2 2 : refusal to conform to an established or conventional creed, rule, or practice. 3 3 : absence of agreement or correspondence.\n[13] Definition of nonconformity. 1a : failure or refusal to conform to an established churchb often capitalized : the movement or principles of English Protestant dissentc often capitalized : the body of English Nonconformists. 2 : refusal to conform to an established or conventional creed, rule, or practice.\n[14] Nonconformity.

Smooth muscle tissue in their walls helps to regulate airflow into the lungs. When greater volumes of air are required by the body, such as during exercise, the smooth muscle relaxes to dilate the bronchi and bronchioles.\n[2] The bronchioles or bronchioli are the passageways by which air passes through the nose or mouth to the alveoli (air sacs) of the lungs, in which branches no longer contain cartilage or glands in their submucosa.he diameter of the bronchioles is often said to be less than 1 mm, though this value can actually range from 5 mm to 0.3 mm. As stated, these bronchioles do not have hyaline cartilage to maintain their patency. Instead, they rely on elastic fibers attached to the surrounding lung tissue for support.\n[3] The epithelium starts as a simple ciliated columnar epithelium and changes to simple ciliated cuboidal epithelium as the bronchioles decreases in size.

These further divide into smaller bronchi and bronchioles within the lung tissue. The structure of the larger bronchi is identical to that of the trachea. On the smaller bronchi the C-shaped cartilage rings are gradually replaced by irregular plaques of cartilage. Bronchioles have no cartilage at all. The bronchioles are less than 1mm in diameter, and undergo further divisions, the last of which is characterised by the loss of goblet cells.\n[7] The main function of the bronchi and bronchioles is to carry air from the trachea into the lungs.

The airway, which includes the nose, mouth, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles, carries air between the lungs and the body's exterior. The lungs...\n[10] The epithelium of the terminal bronchioles is composed of three types of cells-ciliated cells, nonciliated cells and a few basal cells.The epithelium of the respiratory bronchioles has three cell populations.The first near the terminal bronchioles consists of the nonciliated columnar, ciliated columnar and basal cells. The second consists of nonciliated cuboidal cells. The third is most similar to the alveolar epithelial lining.These are nonciliated cells, cuboidal type II cells, and squamous type I cells.he epithelium of the respiratory bronchioles has three cell populations. The first near the terminal bronchioles consists of the nonciliated columnar, ciliated columnar and basal cells. The second consists of nonciliated cuboidal cells.\n[11] The bronchi themselves branch many times into smaller airways, ending in the narrowest airways (bronchioles), which are as small as one half of a millimeter across. The airways resemble an upside-down tree, which is why this part of the respiratory system is often called the bronchial tree. Large airways are held open by semiflexible, fibrous connective tissue called cartilage.\n[12] The innermost layer consists of ciliated mucous membrane. Kinds of bronchi are lobar bronchus (secondary bronchus), primary bronchus, and segmental bronchus (tertiary bronchus) . Also called bronchial tube.

When someone takes a breath through their nose or mouth, the air travels into the larynx. The next step is through the trachea, which carries the air to the left and right bronchus. The bronchi become smaller the closer they get to the lung tissue and are then considered bronchioles.\n[15] The trachea divides into a right and left main bronchus. Each major bronchus then subdivides into smaller airway passages referred to as bronchi. As the airway passages make their way out to the lung tissue, the passages become smaller and are referred to as bronchioles.\n[16] Bronchi. Bronchi are the main passageway into the lungs.

Bronchioles are approximately 1mm or less in diameter and their walls consist of ciliated cuboidal epithelium and a layer of smooth muscle. Bronchioles divide into even smaller bronchioles, called terminal, which are 0.5mm or less in diameter.he diameter of the bronchioles is often said to be less than 1 mm, though this value can actually range from 5 mm to 0.3 mm.

In 2015, the average cost of a wedding dress alteration is between $184 - $255.\n[9] Weddings are expensive and wedding gown alterations is up there on the list of items a bride needs to consider in forming her budget. I know that many bridal stores in my area advise the bride to budget about $150 for gown alterations (not including steaming). good guess would be around $30 to $80 for the average gown. With replacement of beads and other decorations or boning, it can easily go over $100. Sleeve length is another area I check for alteration needs. If the gown has no sleeves, or short ones, this is not a concern.\n[10] 1 Wedding dress alterations can run anywhere from $50-$300 depending on the amount of work needed. 2 If you choose a dress that is meant to be full below the waist, an extra piece can be purchased to add to the body of the dress. 3 This piece can cost $30-$100. Websites such as DressFinder.com can aid you in the search for a personal dress designer. 2 According to a forum thread on the website WeddingBee.com, users claimed that wedding dress prices ranged anywhere from $200 to as much as $2,600 for their dress.\n[11] Beware of Hidden Wedding Dress Costs: Alterations and Bustling. The average bride in the U.S. spends $1,000-$2,000 on her wedding dress. To me, spending that much on a dress you only wear once is just plain crazy. When I was able to get my dream dress for only $400 (on sale from $700), I was ecstatic.\n[12] 1 Do not forget to factor in the cost of alterations, which can run from $20 for a small nip or tuck in the bodice to $200 or more for more labor-intensive work. 2 If you buy your dress at a bridal salon, ask whether alterations are included and, if not, get a written estimate of the alteration costs ahead of time. In the mid-range, expect to pay $500 to $1,000 for an off-the rack or custom-made wedding dress, with a small to medium amount of beading or lace detail, from a chain bridal retailer or bridal boutique.\n[13] 1 Do not forget to factor in the cost of alterations, which can run from $20 for a small nip or tuck in the bodice to $200 or more for more labor-intensive work. 2 If you buy your dress at a bridal salon, ask whether alterations are included and, if not, get a written estimate of the alteration costs ahead of time.

The most commonly used metals used include titanium and stainless steel.\n[2] A prosthetic made of metal and plastic are the most commonly used hip replacement implants. Both the ball and the socket of the hip joint are replaced with a metal implant, and a plastic spacer is placed in between. The most commonly used metals used include titanium and stainless steel.\n[3] The Many Different Materials Used in Hip Replacement Devices. Hip replacement devices break into a few big categories: Metal on Metal (MOM) \u2013 These are what they sound like. Both the socket and the ball are made of stainless steel, titanium, chromium, cobalt or some combination of these.\n[4] Implants may be made of a variety of materials including metal (usually titanium), ceramic or polyethylene (a type of hard plastic). Ongoing research and enabling technology will determine new directions in materials used in hip replacement surgery.\n[5] As a result, some of these implants have been recalled. Implants may be made of a variety of materials including metal (usually titanium), ceramic or polyethylene (a type of hard plastic). Ongoing research and enabling technology will determine new directions in materials used in hip replacement surgery.\n[6] The implant for a total hip replacement is composed of 3 parts: the stem, the ball, and the socket. The stem is made out of metal, usually cobalt-chrome or titanium, and is placed within the native thighbone. The ball is usually made out of polished metal or ceramic, and fits on top of the stem.\n[7] Ceramic Implants. Ceramic hip replacement implants also use metal parts that fit within the bone, but the bearing surface (the ball and the socket) can be made of the ceramic material. Ceramic hip implants are designed to be the most resistant to wear of all available hip replacement implants.\n[8] In metal-on-metal devices both the ball and socket components are made of metal. These metal implants have been used in total hip replacement surgeries and hip resurfacing procedures. Because of metal's durability, metal-on-metal devices were expected to last longer than other hip implants.\n[9] Trunnionosis, Metallosis, and Their Effects. What is Trunnionosis? Hip replacements, specifically of the metal-on-metal variety, are composed of several parts, including the ball, the stem, and the prosthesis. In the majority of hip replacements that are produced today, the prosthesis rests on top of the ball.\n[10] All hip resurfacing operations use a metal-on-metal bearing hip. Most total hip replacements are not metal-on-metal bearings and use other materials including ceramic and high density polyethylene. Your hospital will always have a record of your operation and what implants were used.\n[11] Hip replacements are among the most common orthopedic procedures. When a hip replacement is performed, the arthritic, damaged hip joint is removed. The ball-and-socket hip joint is then replaced with an artificial implant. Hare are brief descriptions of some of the most commonly used hip replacement implants. Not all implants are options for all patients. A prosthetic made of metal and plastic are the most commonly used hip replacement implants. Both the ball and the socket of the hip joint are replaced with a metal implant, and a plastic spacer is placed in between. The most commonly used metals used include titanium and stainless steel.\n[12] The most common is Ti-6 aluminum Ti-4 vanadium (Ti6Al4V), but other more modern alloys are coming into use. Because of the lower moduli of elasticity than cobalt-based alloys or surgical stainless steel, titanium-based alloys have not been found to be as reliable a material when used as a cemented hip replacement.\n[13] Every hip implant has a distinct set of benefits and risks. The key design features of each implant including size, material and dimensions make each system unique. In addition, the same hip implant system will have different outcomes in different patients. It is also important to recognize that hip implants may need to be replaced eventually. Factors that influence the longevity of the device include the patient's age, sex, weight, diagnosis, activity level, conditions of the surgery, and the type of implant chosen. In the United States, there are currently five types of total hip replacement devices available with different bearing surfaces. These are: Metal-on-Polyethylene: The ball is made of metal and the socket is made of plastic (polyethylene) or has a plastic lining.\n[14] Titanium is used to make hip replacements. Titanium is a light metal but very strong, e.g. it is as strong as steel but 45% lighter. For these properties it is used to make lightweight alloys for aircraft, bikes and laptop computers.The compound Titanium dioxide (TiO 2) absorbs UV light and is used in sunscreen.itanium is resistant to corrosion by sea water and therefore is used on parts of ships. The non-reactive properties of titanium make it ideal for use in the body as hip replacements and pacemakers, which won't be attacked by body fluids.\n[15] In a total hip replacement surgery, doctors replace the diseased or damaged hip with an implant consisting of a stem, ball, liner, and socket. 1 The stem, made of metal, is inserted into the femur (thigh bone) and anchors the implant in place. 2 The ball is attached to the top of the stem.\n[16] The same materials are used for hip implants\u2014the stem portions of most hip implants are made of metal alloys, the ball portions are made from metal alloys or polished ceramic, and the acetabular sockets are made from metal, polyethylene (plastic), a combination of polyethylene backed by metal, or ceramic.\n[17] A.

John Harrison (3 April [O.S. 24 March] 1693 \u2013 24 March 1776) was a self-educated English carpenter and clockmaker who invented the marine chronometer, a long-sought-after device for solving the problem of calculating longitude while at sea.\n[5] The invention of the chronometer was a fundamental building block for modern times. But the marine chronometer was then redesigned by John Arnold. He based his design on Harrison's clock, but he simplified it enough to produce accurate marine chronometers in large quantities during the late 1700s.\n[6] He invented the marine chronometer, a long-sought after device for solving the problem of establishing the East-West position or longitude of a ship at sea, thus revolutionising and extending the possibility of safe long-distance sea travel in the Age of Sail.\n[7] Chronograph. A chronograph is a specific type of watch that is used as a stopwatch combined with a display watch. A basic chronograph has an independent sweep second hand; it can be started, stopped, and returned to zero by successive pressure on the stem.Louis Moinet invented the chronograph in 1816. chronograph is a specific type of watch that is used as a stopwatch combined with a display watch. A basic chronograph has an independent sweep second hand; it can be started, stopped, and returned to zero by successive pressure on the stem.\n[8] The British prize was won by John Harrison in 1764 for his seagoing chronometer accurate to one-tenth of a second per day. James Cook used Harrisons chronometer to circumvent the globe and when he returned in 1779 his calculations of longitude based upon the chronometer proved correct to within 8 miles.\n[9] Bain's first patent was dated 11 January 1841, and was in the names of John Barwise, chronometer maker, and Alexander Bain, mechanist. It describes his electric clock which uses a pendulum kept moving by electromagnetic impulses.\n[10] Founded in 1948 in Besan\u00e7on by Henry Louis Belmont, the company distinguished itself in the very beginning by creating the first automatic chronometers manufactured entirely in France, and became famous for the technical qualities and sports characteristics of its watches.\n[11] Read the excerpt from Ship's Chronometer from HMS Beagle.. Our object is one of those lower-cost chronometers, made in 1800 by Thomas Earnshaw. It is made of brass and is around the size of a large pocket watch, with a normal clock dial showing roman numerals and a smaller dial at the bottom for the second hand.\n[12] slide 1 of 6. The Elusive Longitude Before the marine chronometer was invented, Latitude could be found quite accurately with celestial navigation and older instruments like the astrolabe. However, longitude could only be estimated, because an accurate determination of longitude is made by comparing time differences.\n[13] George Daniels' first horological exercise was a Marine Chronometer which he made in 1953. He went onto make many famous pocket and wrist watches which included tourbillons, both one and four minutes, chronographs, equations and repeaters \u2013 and his masterpiece, The Space Traveller.f a man is defined by his work, Dr. George Daniels is defined by his watches and their unique legacy for the world of horology\u2026. Here is a small selection of profiles and images which represent George Daniels' sixty year artistry as a horological designer and inventor.\n[14] Harrison was granted additional money to develop the clock. John Harrison's H3 Chronometer. Harrison spent 17 years working on the third clock, but it did not perform as well as he had imagined. Nevertheless, it was quite a valuable experiment.\n[15] But it was their great astronomer, Ebn Junis, who accomplished the most valuable of all chronometric improvements.\n[16] Who invented the thermometer. The first recorded thermometer was produced by the Italian, Santorio Santorio (1561-1636) who was one of a group of Venetian scientists working at the end of the Sixteenth Century.As with many inventions the thermometer came about through the work of many scientists and was improved upon by many others.alileo Galilei is often claimed to be the inventor of the thermometer. However the instrument he invented could not strictly be called a thermometer: to be a thermometer an instrument must measure temperature differences; Galileo's instrument did not do this, but merely indicated temperature differences.\n[17] The barometer invented in the 17th century by the Italian physicist and mathematician Evangelista Torricelli, and still in use today, is a U-tube that is sealed at one end (see Figure 1B). It may be filled with liquid, with the sealed end downward, and then inverted. On inversion, a...\n[18] Another early pioneer was the British inventor William Friese-Greene. He began to experiment with the use of oiled paper as a medium for displaying motion pictures in 1885 and by 1887 he was experimenting with the use of celluloid. In 1889, Friese-Greene took out a patent for a 'chronophotographic' camera.\n[19] Who invented the thermometer.

Large specimens can measure around 10 inches (25 centimeters) in length. The seed is toxic, and found in the center of the fruit; toxic extracts from the sapote seed are used in a variety of applications, including as an insecticide.\n[11] The aim of MAME is to be a reference to the inner workings of the emulated arcade machines; the ability to actually play the games is considered a nice side effect.

Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: how often to button quail lay eggs.\n\n[1] Like chickens, button quail can lay one egg a day every day, for almost her entire life. Without special attention, this practice can very quickly deplete the female of her bone calcium and other essential nutrients, leading to a very early death.\n[2] So if you are raising the Button Quail in your home, they are going to receive this right combination all year round.

If you're purchasing these quail as pets only and don't want any eggs, follow this procedure also.\n[3] A good hatch depends on how well you know your incubator. For the first 14 days the button quail eggs should be turned (better described as being rotated from one side to the other) at least twice a day. Three or four times a day is better. If you have an automatic turner in your incubator, it will handle that for you.\n[4] So if you are raising the Button Quail in your home, they are going to receive this right combination all year round.

So, you have your eggs, how long do they need to be incubated for? My experience is with Japanese (Coturnix) Quail and Button Quail only, so here are the incubation and hatch times for those two. Japanese (Coturnix) Quail eggs hatch around 17-18 days once you start incubation. They can take up to 21-22 days to hatch, so don't worry if they don't hatch on day 17. Some may even hatch as early as day 15. Button Quail eggs hatch around 16-17 days once you start incubation. It can take up to 22 days, so don't worry if they don't hatch on day 16. Don't make the mistake of counting from the day they were laid.\n[10] Best Answer: It depends on what type of quail you have. I own button quail, and a button quail usually lives 21/2 years to 4 years. It's a little less for a female. It depends on how many eggs the female has laid and how adequate her nutrition is. The longest living button quail I've heard of is 9 years, but that is pretty rare.\n[11] The nests tend to be large because of the number of eggs they must accommodate. Female quail can lay up to 16 eggs, but more often they lay 12 to 13 eggs. Quail, especially chicks, have a high mortality rate, with only 5 to 30 percent growing into adults. After about three weeks, the eggs hatch into chicks. These chicks are instantly mobile and able to leave the nest.\n[12] Incubation for button quail takes roughly 16 days, although we have had reports of a little slower hatch of up to 18 days. We suspect that is due to the varied temperatures and movement during transportation, or perhaps due to the variance in incubator temperatures, humidity, and elevation changes.\n[13] October 12, 2009. Quail lay eggs early and often. These tiny birds begin laying while barely little more than chicks themselves, and can lay up to 300 eggs annually. In the United States, the coturnix quail is the most common type raised domestically. This breed is also known as the Japanese quail, the Bible quail and the Nile quail.\n[14] Add hay/straw to their cage. Some quails like building nests to lay their eggs in whilst others will lay them anywhere. 9. Do not mess with or clean the cage a lot. You will not only destroy their nest but you will also disturb them as well. Clean the cage once every 2 weeks.\n[15] If you normally incubate chicken eggs at 100* and 50% humidity, then do quail the same way. The only ones I've found that need it a little different are button quail because they dry out too easily. They should take 18 days to hatch but can hatch anywhere from 15-21 days. Stop turning day 14 to be safe, though I've had them hatch in the turners with little problems. Coturnix eggs are pretty easy, you could probably set them in a bowl out in your yard and they'd hatch.\n[16] Quail lay eggs early and often.

Bobwhite quails lay an average of 12 eggs per clutch, though they can lay as many as 20; they only lay one egg a day. They lay a large number of eggs because they often lose their nests. It takes nearly a month for the quail to hatch.

If your quails are still not laying eggs, this may indicate that they are sick.\n[19] A quail which is breed to lay eggs should receive 14 hours of light per day. This may mean that artificial lightning may be needed. If the quail receives the right amount of l \u2026 ight, they will approx.lay 1 egg per day. On average they will lay 200-300 eggs per year. I hope this answered your question.ow many eggs do quail lay at one time? No bird can lay more than an egg every day (or just a little less than 24 hours).\n[20] Quick Answer.

Tendons are a form of connective tissue that is continuous with muscle fiber and actually connects muscle to bone.Skeletal muscles that produce movement are attached to two bones that articulate, or meet.long with the joints, which act as fulcrums, the bones and muscles work together to create levers in the body. Depending on the location of the load in relation to the joint or fulcrum, muscles and bones create either a mechanical advantage or disadvantage when you lift an object.\n[9] They work together, with the muscles contracting and pulling on tendons attached to bones, therefore pulling or pushing the bones to create movement.

Identify the various arrangements of muscle fibers in a skeletal muscle, and relate the arrangements to the strength of contraction and range of motion. 4. Explain how the prime mover, antagonist, synergist, and fixator in a muscle group work together to produce movements.5.rigin and Insertion. i. Contractions of skeletal muscles produce movements by exerting a pulling force on tendons, which in turn pull on bones (or other structures, such as skin). ii. Most muscles extend across at least one joint and are attached to the articulating bones that form the joint. iii.\n[13] The point of articulation, or where the muscles and the bones connect, is known as a joint. Tendons are a form of connective tissue that is continuous with muscle fiber and actually connects muscle to bone. Skeletal muscles that produce movement are attached to two bones that articulate, or meet.When movement occurs at any given joint, only one of the articulating bones will move.orking in unison, the joints, bones and skeletal muscles of the body comprise your musculoskeletal system. The primary function of these components working together is to create movement.\n[14] How both interact: The skeletal system is covered with muscles that enable us to move. These muscles are attached to the bones through tendons and often stretch from one end of the bone to the other. Your bones and muscles work together through a series of impulses and signals communicated between the brain and skeletal muscles. In order to move, the nervous system then sends signals a skeletal muscle to contract. When the muscle contracts, this movement causes the attached bone to follow.\n[15] Movement is made possible because of the way that bones, muscles, tendons and ligaments work together. Bones are rigid tissues that can support weight without bending.Muscle is tissue that can contract and relax to cause movement.

It also is used to treat people who have had a heart attack. Carvedilol is often used in combination with other medications. Carvedilol is in a class of medications called beta-blockers. High blood pressure is a common condition and when not treated, can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys and other parts of the body.\n[16] Carvedilol is used very often for specific cases of congestive heart failure, high blood pressure, and treatment after a heart attack. Carvedilol is a beta blocker used to treat, but not cure, congestive heart failure. Beta blockers lessen the work that the heart has to do and, by doing so, help maintain a regular heartbeat. In this way, carvedilol helps to lessen the progression and symptoms of congestive heart failure.\n[17] Carvedilol is a beta-blocker. Beta-blockers affect the heart and circulation (blood flow through arteries and veins). Carvedilol is used to treat heart failure and hypertension (high blood pressure). It is also used after a heart attack that has caused your heart not to pump as well. Carvedilol may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.\n[18] Carvedilol is in a group of drugs called beta-blockers. Beta-blockers affect the heart and circulation (blood flow through arteries and veins). Carvedilol is used to treat heart failure and hypertension (high blood pressure). It is also used after a heart attack that has caused your heart not to pump as well. Carvedilol may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.\n[19] PRESCRIBED FOR: Carvedilol is used alone or with a diuretic (water-pill) to control high blood pressure (hypertension). Carvedilol also may be used in combination with other drugs to manage mild or moderate congestive heart failure. It is also used for treating people who develop heart failure after a heart attack.\n[20] Carvedilol is usually used to help lower blood pressure in people with hypertension, or as an additional treatment for people with heart failure. As a result of the way it works, reducing the heart rate and blood pressure, carvedilol is a good option for people with high blood pressure to reduce the load on the heart.\nSearch Query: what carvedilol used for.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: what does it mean if your tsh is low.\n\n[1] What does a Low TSH Mean? Your thyroid gland is producing too much of the thyroid hormone which signals to your brain to stop producing anymore. Individuals who suffer from low TSH levels and high levels of T3 and T4 (the thyroid hormones) have a condition that is commonly referred to as hyperthyroidism.\n[2] What do low TSH levels mean? According to About.com, low levels of TSH, or thyroid-stimulating hormone, occur when the pituitary gland shuts down TSH production due to high levels of thyroid hormone in the blood. The low levels of TSH are the pituitary gland's attempt to keep thyroid hormone levels normal within the body. What are some symptoms associated with high TSH levels? According to WebMD, high TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) levels indicate an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism). Common symptoms include feeling weak, tired or depressed, sensitivity to cold, constipation, brittle nails, memory problems, and heavy or irregular periods.\n[3] If TSH is high, it typically means that your thyroid function is too low (hypothyroid). If TSH is low, then it generally means the thyroid is overactive (hyperthyroid.) Your doctor may also check levels of other thyroid hormones in your blood.\n[4] 3 doctors agreed: 1 Yes: A low TSH usually means that you are have a high level of thyroid hormone in your system and hyperthyroidism can be associated with hair loss. 2 Generally low: Tsh will lead to an increased tendency for hair to break due to poor protein in the hair shaft, but it's not true hair loss. 3 Wrong assumptions: Iron level not relevant.\n[5] No: There are no such foods such as that. If your TSH level is low, that means your thyroid is overproducing thyroid hormone and that could be a goiter or other thyroid disease-you definitely need that checked and treated. If your thyroid hormone is low, then your TSH would be high.\n[6] 1 A high TSH level means that your thyroid gland is underactive. When your thyroid gland is underactive and not producing enough thyroid hormone, your body produces more TSH to stimulate the gland and increase its activity. A low TSH level means that your thyroid gland is overactive.\n[7] Yes: A low TSH usually means that you are have a high level of thyroid hormone in your system and hyperthyroidism can be associated with hair loss. Usually the hair becomes softer and finer with hyperthyroidism as opposed to the hair loss with hypothyroidism which is usually associated with ...Read more.\n[8] Low TSH Levels: What They Can Mean. Low TSH can indicate that there's an abundance of thyroid hormone being produced by the thyroid gland, so the pituitary gland sees no need to release TSH.\n[9] A low TSH result may indicate: 1 An overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) 2 Excessive amounts of thyroid hormone medication in those who are being treated for an underactive (or removed) thyroid gland.\n[10] Responses (3) Confusing I know but in general a low TSH is indicative of an overactive thyroid or hyperthyroidism and your thyroid hormone dose needs to be reduced. A high TSH is indicative of an underactive thyroid or hypothyroidism and your medicine needs increasing.\n[11] However, if an individual suffers from low TSH levels AND low levels of thyroid hormones, then it could mean that the pituitary gland (which is responsible for producing thyroid) is weak from disease or damaged.\n[12] But the doctor may have said -- or may have meant -- your TSH is low -- which is indicative of hyperthyroidism. Remember, a low TSH is indicative of hyperthyroidism -- an overactive thyroid -- and a high TSH is indicative of hypothyroidism -- an underactive thyroid.\n[13] \u200bA low TSH, assuming you aren't taking medication, is a sign that you may be hyperthyroid. But that's not what I want to focus on here. Instead I want to spend time explaining what happens to your TSH when you are taking thyroid hormone.\n[14] 1 Low TSH-Low TSH levels can be a sign that you are dealing with an overactive thyroid gland from conditions such as goiter, noncancerous tumors or Graves's disease. 2 The thyroid may also become overactive during the first trimester of pregnancy.\n[15] A low TSH result indicates that the thyroid gland is overactive, and is producing too many hormones. A high TSH result is indicative of hypothyroidism, because the thyroid is not responding properly to the pituitary gland, and thus, is not creating enough hormones.\n[16] And if your TSH test comes in above normal, some doctors will want to INCREASE your dosage of thyroid hormone, because levels above normal are considered potentially hypothyroid (underactive.) To recap: LOW TSH suggests you are closer to HYPERthyroidism (overactive), and have too much thyroid hormone circulating.\n[17] LOW TSH suggests you are closer to HYPERthyroidism (overactive), and have too much thyroid hormone circulating. HIGH TSH suggests you are closer to HYPOthyroidism (underactive), and you don't have enough thyroid hormone circulating.\n[18] Typically, if there is a low level of thyroid hormone in the body, the pituitary will increase production of TSH to stimulate the thyroid to produce more thyroid hormone. Therefore a high TSH level suggests an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism), while a low TSH indicates too much thyroid hormone in the body (hyperthyroidism).\n[19] Get help from a doctor now \u203a. Yes: An elevated TSH indicates that your pituitary gland feels that your thyroid level is somewhat low. The fact that the T4 and T3 are normal means that the problem is still mild. If you have symptoms of an underactive thyroid, treatment with thyroid hormone is indicated.\n[20] Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is a pituitary gland hormone that stimulates the thyroid gland to produce hormones. When thyroid hormone levels are normal or high, your TSH should be lower. An abnormally low TSH can be the first sign of hyperthyroidism.\nSearch Query: what does it mean if your tsh is low.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

The term derives from its pink, soft, granular appearance on surface of wound but its histological features are:\n[2] By day 3, the acute inflammatory response is replaced by chronic inflammation (macrophages). Also at 3 days, granulation tissue begins forming, courtesy of growth factors secreted by platelets, macrophages and endothelial cells. Growth factors induce regeneration of the basal cells of the epidermis By day 5, granulation tissue has filled the incisional space. During the second week, collagen accumulates. Leukocytes, edema, and increased vascularity begin to disappear.\n[3] These 10 animal facts will amaze you. Tissue granulation is a process by which fibrous tissue rich with blood capillaries replaces blood clots formed at the site of a healing wound. Through this process, healthy and normal skin is able to replace skin that was damaged.The tissue that forms over a wound during this process is called granulation tissue.The tissue that forms usually has a light pink color and a relatively rough texture; it is also quite moist and tends to be bumpy in appearance.issue granulation occurs in the proliferative phase, during which new, healthy tissue reforms and rebuilds the area of the wound. The final phase of wound healing is the remodeling phase, when the new tissue fully integrates with the old tissue.\n[4] Granulation tissue is collagen-rich tissue which forms at the site of an injury. As the body heals, this tissue fills in the injury, and may eventually scar over. The scar may fade over time, especially if the wound is small. In some cases, the body produces too much granulation tissue, in a condition known as proud flesh, in which case medical treatment may be required to halt the overproduction. The appearance of granulation tissue is a good sign. When a wound starts granulating, it means that the body is starting to rebuild after the injury. This highly fibrous tissue is usually pink because the body produces numerous small blood vessels to provide a supply of oxygen and nutrients to remove waste.\n[5] Tissue granulation is a process by which fibrous tissue rich with blood capillaries replaces blood clots formed at the site of a healing wound.

Neovascularization - Within days, angiogenesisi begins and new capillaries form and supply nutrients in addition to providing some initial bridging of the wound.\n[11] Granulation tissue can be noted from the healthy wound buds that protrude from the wound base. During wound healing, granulation tissue usually appears during the proliferative phase. Angiogenesis is the process by which new blood vessels form, bringing in tiny capilarry buds that appear as granular tissue.\n[12] Granulation and remodeling. Once the wound is free of debris and new blood vessels have begun to form, repair cells called fibroblasts lay down a scaffolding of collagen.

In each case, there would be no wave without it. The radio wave, as well as all other electromagnetic waves, can travel. through material media, but don't need one in order to propagate.\n[2] They do not require a medium to travel through. A radio wave is composed of an electrical wave, and a magnetic wave. The 2 waves travel together, creating each other as the wave travels through what ever medium it is in, be that air, wire, or what we call space. kerry k \u00b7 10 years ago.\n[3] S, India. Unlike sound waves or ocean waves, radios waves do not travel in a material. Radio waves are a class of electromagnetic waves and consist of nothing more than electric and magnetic fields. Since they don't require any medium through which to travel, they can go right through empty space.That's why we're able to see the stars, after all.adio waves are a class of electromagnetic waves and consist of nothing more than electric and magnetic fields. Since they don't require any medium through which to travel, they can go right through empty space.\n[4] Since the actual oscillations take place at right angles to the direction of wave propagation, radio waves are transverse waves. Since radio waves are not mechanical, they do not need a medium to travel in; they can travel even in a vacuum. Like all types of electromagnetic waves, radio waves travel at a speed of about 300 000 km per second in a vacuum. When radio waves enter into other material, they slow down a little. When you tune a radio to listen to a particular frequency, the radio takes in the signals at that frequency.\n[5] RF (radio frequency) is an electromagnetic wave form that can be distorted by metal and magnetic fields but can travel in a vacuum. ultrasound is a physical wave form that requires a medium to travel in (solid or liquid) and will not travel in a vacuum.\n[6] Medium wave (MW) is the part of the medium frequency (MF) radio band used mainly for AM radio broadcasting.For Europe the MW band ranges from 526.5 kHz to 1606.5 kHz, using channels spaced every 9 kHz, and in North America an extended MW broadcast band goes from 535 kHz to 1705 kHz, using 10 kHz spaced channels.ames such as FM/AM Stereo or AM & FM Stereo can be misleading and usually do not signify that the radio will decode C-QUAM AM stereo, whereas a set labeled FM Stereo/AM Stereo or AMAX Stereo will support AM stereo.\n[7] No, a radio wave is not a mechanical wave. A radio wave is a form of electromagnetic (EM) energy, and it does not require a medium through which to travel like a mechanical wa \u2026 ve does. Radio waves can travel through the vacuum of space. Let's contrast that with a mechanical wave.\n[8] Electromagnetic waves: 1. Electromagnetic (EM) waves (example light waves, radio waves, x-rays etc) can travel through vacuum; they do not require any medium (matter) to travel through and their travel is reduced, to some extent, by the presence of any medium. The common examples of medium are glass, water, air etc.\n[9] 1 When all air is removed there is no medium for the sound waves to travel through so no sound is heard. 2 Here is a video demonstrating this concept: MPEG Video (10MB - 1 hour on 56k modem, 1-2 minutes on high speed connection). 3 Radio waves travel like light waves. 4 They can be absorbed, reflected or transmitted.\n[10] For example take an example of air it is a longitudinal wave the particle carry some kinetic energy and momentum and passes next to it but as the case in light and radio waves is not possible they travel of their own without any medium or it can travel through medium like air\u2026.\n[11] Best Answer: A sound wave is a type of pressure wave which can also be called a compression wave. Pressure waves depend on the presence of a medium such as air for it to travel through. Without the medium they cannot travel. Therefore neither A, C or D could travel through space as space is a vacuum lacking a medium. However, radio waves can travel through space. Radio waves form a section of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n[12] No, a radio wave is not a mechanical wave. A radio wave is a form of electromagnetic (EM) energy, and it does not require a medium through which to travel like a mechanical wa \u2026 ve does. Radio waves can travel through the vacuum of space. Let's contrast that with a mechanical wave. A mechanical wave involves the transfer of mechanical energy into and through a medium. Sound waves (which travel through air) and water waves (which move through water) are mechanical waves.\n[13] Medium wavelength radio waves are reflected from the ionosphere, a layer of charged particles in the upper atmosphere, so they can be used for long distance communication. Digital radio has better-quality reception as it uses digital signals and so does not have problems of noise and interference.\n[14] No, a radio wave is not a mechanical wave. A radio wave is a form of electromagnetic (EM) energy, and it does not require a medium through which to travel like a mechanical wa\u2026ve does. Radio waves can travel through the vacuum of space.\n[15] No, a radio wave is not a mechanical wave. A radio wave is a form of electromagnetic (EM) energy, and it does not require a medium through which to travel like a mechanical wa \u2026 ve does. Radio waves can travel through the vacuum of space.\n[16] In a similar manner, a wave medium is the substance that carries a wave (or disturbance) from one location to another. The wave medium is not the wave and it doesn't make the wave; it merely carries or transports the wave from its source to other locations. In the case of our slinky wave, the medium through that the wave travels is the slinky coils. In the case of a water wave in the ocean, the medium through which the wave travels is the ocean water. In the case of a sound wave moving from the church choir to the pews, the medium through which the sound wave travels is the air in the room. And in the case of the stadium wave, the medium through which the stadium wave travels is the fans that are in the stadium.\n[17] Radio waves can travel in a vacuum, but sound waves need a physical medium. To explain \u2026 the apparent contradiction, the sound wave is converted to an electrical signal version that is then used to modulate the radio signal. 3 people found this useful.
