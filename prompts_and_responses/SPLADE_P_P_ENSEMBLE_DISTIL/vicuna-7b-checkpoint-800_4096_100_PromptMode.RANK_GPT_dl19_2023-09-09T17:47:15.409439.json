Adults on a host animal can live for 133 days, but if they become dislodged they need to rapidly find a new host, or quickly hop back onto the original host. They die within four days of losing their host.\n[13] It's estimated that with any flea population, 95% of all these parasites are in a sub-adult stage (i.e., eggs, larvae, or pupa). These sub-adult fleas can lie dormant in your home for several months before they hatch and start the cycle all over again. Stages of a Flea's Life.\n[14] Report Abuse. Fleas generally don't survive past 100 days, even if they live on a host (the animal on which they feed). However, without a host, they have no food source, and may die between 2 and 14 days. The same can't be said for flea eggs and larvae, which do not require a host and can reach high populations. Adult Flea 1. Once an adult flea is deprived of its host, it will basically starve to death. It will generally die between 2 and 14 days.\n[15] However, completely developed adult fleas can live for several months without eating, so long as they do not emerge from their puparia.

Approximately 90-95% of the fleas are cat fleas.\n[19] The fleas you see on your cat are adult fleas, which are only about 5 percent of the flea population in an environment. The other fleas are scattered about as eggs, larvae or pupae. Adult fleas generally live two to four weeks, although in a hospitable environment they may live up to four months.\n[20] Fleas removed from their host will die of starvation within four days. Young fleas that haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fed can live slightly longer without a blood meal, around one week. Pre-emerged adults, remaining inside their cocoons, can enter into a dormant-like state.

In poor conditions, it may take 28-45 days for flea larvae to mature. How quickly they develop depends upon ambient temperature, relative humidity, and food availability.\n[7] Types of Fleas. There are thousands of types of fleas, but the most common seen in the United States is the cat flea. It has a lifespan between 30 and 75 days and four different developmental stages. Fleas feed on the blood of the host cat.\n[8] Fleas can live for about 100 days during which time the females produce 400-500 offspring. Fleas transport themselves on rodents and other mammals, and usually remain on their hosts at all times. These pests use their powerful legs to jump as high as 8 vertically, which is 150 times their own height. If humans could do this, we would be able to leap over skyscrapers.\n[9] Firstly, a little zoology: fleas live about 50 days and can lay over 2000 eggs in that time[1]. Assume 10% live to adulthood; you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got 200 little beasts that can jump several inches through the air. You need to kill off the adults and take care of the larvae to keep you and your pet free of nasty bites.\n[10] After about 2 days (range 2-21 days), depending on environmental conditions, the flea egg hatches torelease a first stage flea larva. This flea larva lives in the host's environment(it is part of the environmental stage of the fleas life cycle), where it feeds on fleadroppings (flea dirt) and dander.\n[11] The pupae stage of the flea life cycle accounts for about 10 percent of the flea population in a home.

Fleas lay up to 50 eggs a day, which is equal to their body weight. They can lay this many eggs because they suck up 15 times their body weight in blood daily. This blood lust can continue for 3 months.\n[6] Fleas can lay 20 to 40 eggs per day, and 10 female fleas can create almost a quarter of a million different life stages in a month. Newly emerged flea larvae can survive two weeks without a blood meal, and pre-emerged fleas (pupae/cocoon stage) can survive six months without feeding.\n[7] When a flea finds an appropriate host, it will begin feeding almost immediately. A female flea will begin laying eggs about 24 hours after enjoying her first blood meal. Fleas pass their time on their host eating, breeding and laying eggs.

When a flea loses its host, it must find a new one as quickly as possible. According to 1-800-PetMeds, a little over half of newborn fleas may be able to survive for two months without a host if their environment is humid enough.\n[19] When a flea finds an appropriate host, it will begin feeding almost immediately. A female flea will begin laying eggs about 24 hours after enjoying her first blood meal. Fleas pass their time on their host eating, breeding and laying eggs. Usually, an adult flea will live for two or three months.\n[20] Since fleas can live up to a year and a half (See: How Long do Fleas Live) and lay up to 50 eggs a day all the while, it doesn't take much imagination to see how big the problem can get in a short period of time.

The complete life cycle of the flea takes about four weeks, varying according to the temperature. The female fleas lay at night while attached to the bird, and the very small eggs fall to the ground. In about four days, small wormlike larvae emerge from the eggs. The larvae feed on organic material, mainly the dried blood excreted by the adult fleas, and shelter in the surface dust and litter on the soil. After several moults, they grow to about 3 mm, cease to feed and burrow down into the soil to a depth of about 15 cm.\n[9] The lifecycle of a flea. 5% of fleas live in the environment as an adult, 95 % of fleas live as eggs, larvae or pupae.

Contrary to belief, fleas cannot go through several generations without having a blood meal. The entire life cycle (Figure 5) of a flea can require two weeks to two years. Hot, wet, summer months favor egg laying.\n[4] The flea life cycle has four stages: Egg: An adult female flea can lay up to 40 eggs a day. The eggs are laid on the host \u00e2\u0080\u008bbut will dry and fall off that host into the environment (pet bedding, carpet, etc).

Fleas can live up to a year and a half when they have a food supply, the optimum temperature (70F to 85F), and ideal humidity (70%). In reality though, most live for an average of 2-3 months.\n[6] A female flea will begin to lay eggs within 24-48 hours of her first blood meal. She defecates blood from her host that will fall off the host along with the eggs, re-starting the life cycle. Adult fleas can live for about 4-6 weeks depending on the environment.\n[7] Once the flea reaches adulthood, its primary goal is to find blood and then to reproduce. Its total life span can be as long one and one-half years in ideal conditions. Female fleas can lay 5000 or more eggs over their life, allowing for phenomenal growth rates.

Newly emerged adult fleas live only about one week if a blood meal is not obtained.\n[13] Generally speaking, an adult flea only lives for 2 or 3 months. Without a host to provide a blood meal, a flea's life can be as short as a few days. Under ideal conditions of temperature, food supply, and humidity, adult fleas can live for up to a year and a half.\n[14] How Long Do Fleas Live. Flea Life Span. Fleas can live up to a year and a half when they have a food supply, the optimum temperature (70F to 85F), and ideal humidity (70%). In reality though, most live for an average of 2-3 months. Even if you remove the pets from your house for a time, the fleas can still survive for several months without feeding.\n[15] 1 Fleas pass through a complete life cycle of four stages. made up of 50% eggs, 30% larvae, 15% pupae and only 5% biting adults. 1 Completion of the life cycle from egg to adult varies from two weeks to eight months. Normally the female flea lays about 15 to 20 eggs per day up to 600 in a lifetime.\n[16] Generally speaking, an adult flea only lives for 2 or 3 months. Without a host for food a flea's life might be as short as a few days. With ample food supply, the adult flea will often live up to 100 days.

Completion of the life cycle from egg to adult varies from two weeks to eight months.\n[18] Stickfast flea life history. The complete life cycle of the flea takes about four weeks, varying according to the temperature. The female fleas lay at night while attached to the bird, and the very small eggs fall to the ground. In about four days, small wormlike larvae emerge from the eggs. The larvae feed on organic material, mainly the dried blood excreted by the adult fleas, and shelter in the surface dust and litter on the soil. After several moults, they grow to about 3 mm, cease to feed and burrow down into the soil to a depth of about 15 cm.\n[19] The lifecycle of a flea. 5% of fleas live in the environment as an adult, 95 % of fleas live as eggs, larvae or pupae. For effective flea control it is essential to break the lifecycle in the environment. 1 Adult Fleas-jump onto your dog or cat, feed on its blood and then start laying eggs. One flea broke a record with a four-foot vertical jump. 2 Undisturbed and without a blood meal, a flea can live more than 100 days. 3 On average, they live two to three months. 4 Female fleas cannot lay eggs until after their first blood meal and begin to lay eggs within 36-48 hours after that meal.\n[20] When it comes to eliminating fleas from your pet and from your home, there are some key things to consider. First, it is very important to be familiar with and understand the life cycle of the flea when you are trying to eradicate their presence completely. There are four stages in the life cycle of a flea: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Depending on the environmental temperature and humidity levels, the total life cycle will take anywhere from a couple weeks to many months. Optimal conditions for fleas are between 70-85\u00c2\u00b0F and 70 percent humidity.\nSearch Query: how long is life cycle of flea.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Contrary to belief, fleas cannot go through several generations without having a blood meal. The entire life cycle (Figure 5) of a flea can require two weeks to two years. Hot, wet, summer months favor egg laying.\n[14] The flea life cycle has four stages: Egg: An adult female flea can lay up to 40 eggs a day. The eggs are laid on the host \u00e2\u0080\u008bbut will dry and fall off that host into the environment (pet bedding, carpet, etc). Eggs typically hatch within about two days.\n[15] How Long Do Fleas Live. Flea Life Span. Fleas can live up to a year and a half when they have a food supply, the optimum temperature (70F to 85F), and ideal humidity (70%). In reality though, most live for an average of 2-3 months.\n[16] A female flea will begin to lay eggs within 24-48 hours of her first blood meal. She defecates blood from her host that will fall off the host along with the eggs, re-starting the life cycle. Adult fleas can live for about 4-6 weeks depending on the environment.\n[17] Once the flea reaches adulthood, its primary goal is to find blood and then to reproduce. Its total life span can be as long one and one-half years in ideal conditions. Female fleas can lay 5000 or more eggs over their life, allowing for phenomenal growth rates. Average 30\u00e2\u0080\u009390 days.\n[18] 6 weeks. In 3 weeks, one flea can pass through its entire life cycle and can lay 1000 eggs. In another 3 weeks, those eggs can hatch and lay 1,000 eggs each, so within 6 weeks, it is possible to have a million new fleas.\n[19] Stickfast flea life history. The complete life cycle of the flea takes about four weeks, varying according to the temperature. The female fleas lay at night while attached to the bird, and the very small eggs fall to the ground.

Using Bluetooth.\n[2] Bluetooth is a short-range wireless technology you can use to connect a device to other nearby Bluetooth-capable devices and accessories, such as headsets, speakers, printers, etc.\n[3] Bluetooth is a family of protocols that are popular for building wireless accessories. A common use for Bluetooth is for connecting mobile phone accessories, but other applications also exist, such as wireless mice and keyboards for computers; some of the applications for Bluetooth are: Handsfree headsets for mobile phones - for phone calls (not for music)\n[4] Bluetooth is a wireless technology that allows exchange of data over short distances using short wave length radio transmission. In Bluetooth technology, radio waves of microwave frequency range are used. Bluetooth technology uses a radio technology called 'frequency hopping spread spectrum'. It is a method of transmitting radio signals by quickly changing the carrier throughout the multiple frequency channels using a pseudo random sequence known to both transmitter and receiver. Bluetooth technology gives us the benefits of wireless control &communication among different devices.\n[5] For smart-home wireless networking, there are numerous technologies competing to become the standard of choice. Wi-Fi consumes a lot of power, and Bluetooth is limited in signal range and number of devices. Other network standards competing with Z-Wave include Thread and ZigBee.\n[6] Best Answer: WiFi and wireless networking are the same thing. It's basically a means of connecting to a computer network (such as the Internet) via a short-distance radio signal, removing the need for wires.\n[7] Wireless broadband \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or Wi-Fi \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is a broadband connection to the internet that's accessed without cables. This is different from 3G or 4G mobile broadband, which uses mobile phone signals. With Wi-Fi, it's only the connection between your computer and the router that is wireless, not the actual broadband connection itself.\n[8] Your laptop, smartphone, and tablet probably all have integrated Bluetooth support. Bluetooth is a standard that allows devices to communicate wirelessly. Most people are familiar with Bluetooth headsets, but there are more things you can do with Bluetooth. To make two Bluetooth devices work together, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to \u00e2\u0080\u009cpair\u00e2\u0080\u009d them.

The chip can be plugged into computers, digital cameras and mobile phones. Find out more about Bluetooth in this short guide. Bluetooth is a way of exchanging data wirelessly over short distances, and is an attempt to do away with your computer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s jungle of wiring. Using a special radio frequency to transmit data, it creates a short range network. It is very secure and can connect up to eight devices (items of electronic equipment) at the same time.\n[15] The type of networks each standard creates is different as well. Bluetooth has no hub. Any two devices with Bluetooth adapters can connect to each other. A single Bluetooth-enabled device can connect to up to seven devices and each of those devices can connect to up to seven other devices. A Wi-Fi enabled network relies on a hub. All devices on a Wi-Fi network ultimately connect through a single wireless access point, also called a wireless router.\n[16] Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard for exchanging data over short distances (using short-wavelength UHF radio waves in the ISM band from 2.4 to 2.485 GHz[4]) from fixed and mobile devices, and building personal area networks (PANs).\n[17] Bluetooth is a wireless technology that makes short-range connections between devices (like your Mac, and a mouse or keyboard) at distances up to 10 meters (approximately 30 feet).\n[18] Bluetooth wireless technology uses radio waves (in the 2.4 GHz range), and is designed to be a secure, low power and inexpensive way of connecting and exchanging information between devices without the need for wires or cables to link devices together. Bluetooth wireless technology profile is a specification that defines the minimum requirements that the Bluetooth wireless technology enabled device must support in a specific usage scenario. Compatibility and operation between Bluetooth wireless technology enabled devices may vary.\n[19] Bluetooth is the technology for creating a Wireless Personal Area Network to connect up to eight computers or other devices such as mobile phone and PDA (i.e. one device acts as a master with up to 7 active slaves) in an ad-hoc network (piconet).\n[20] Bluetooth is a technology that makes short-range wireless connections between devices (such as your Mac and your mouse or keyboard) at distances up to 10 meters (33 feet).

Wi-Fi is intended as a replacement for high speed cabling for general local area network access in work areas.\n[2] Also like WiFi, Bluetooth is \u00e2\u0080\u009cfairly\u00e2\u0080\u009d secure. Unlike WiFi, tethering via Bluetooth isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t all that common. Sure, people do it, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little more involved to set up than WiFi, and a little more involved every time you want to use Bluetooth tethering. If power consumption is a concern, Bluetooth is probably the way to go, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re willing to configure it.\n[3] ZigBee is more economical than Wi-Fi while Bluetooth protocol also consumes more energy and has a greater scattering of parameters of conventionally compatible units. This is caused by the fact that Bluetooth does not have a unified data transfer standard.\n[4] Bluetooth basically does the same thing a USB cable connection does, but it is a wireless connection to your printer, modem, and other peripherals. Bluetooth is a technology that allows voice and data connections between a wide range of mobile and stationary devices through short-range digital two-way radio. 1 Cellphone and PC manufacturers may enhance their Bluetooth product offerings with support for its low-energy wireless technology.\n[5] IEEE 802.11 working group standards like 802.11h and 802.11j are extensions or offshoots of Wi-Fi technology that each serve a very specific purpose. Bluetooth is an alternative wireless network technology that followed a different development path than the 802.11 family.\n[6] WiFi has a greater range than Bluetooth \u00e2\u0080\u0093 perhaps as much as 120 feet indoors, but the actual range may be less. With some planning, WiFi can cover an entire house. One way to assure maximum coverage is to locate the WiFi router in the center of a house, or where its coverage is most useful.\n[7] I use a separate usb wifi adapter. I heard that bluetooth and wifi work the same way. Just want to know if it will apply to this or not. WiFi LAN communication protocol is completely different and is used when high speeds are required and communication distances are much further.\n[8] No brainer here. Wi-Fi Direct offers speeds of up to 250Mbps while Bluetooth 4.0 lags behind at a paltry-seeming 25Mbps. While I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m somewhat skeptical that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll come close to the touted maximum speed, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no doubt it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s significantly faster than the current Bluetooth High Speed standard.\n[9] Bluetooth 4.0 is using AES 128-bit encryption, while Wi-Fi Direct relies on WPA2 security, which uses AES 256-bit encryption. Both forms use key-based encryption and authentication methods, and both offer enough security for the average consumer.\n[10] Wireless vs Bluetooth Headphones Both these types of headphones are wireless i.e. they do not use wires of any form to connect to a device. But the main difference between wireless and bluetooth headphones is their range. A wireless headset can receive signals from up to a distance of 100 feet (30 meters). On the contrary, Bluetooth headphones are designed for devices at a distance of up to 30 feet (9 meters).

Bluetooth 4.0 uses AES 128-bit encryption to protect your data as it is transmitted between devices. Wi-Fi Direct, on the other hand, uses WPA2 security, and its AES 256-bit encryption. The winner is clear, but it should be stated that even Bluetooth 4.0 is remarkably secure.\n[16] Generally, Bluetooth streams audio at a lower quality and over less distance than Wi-Fi-based technologies. Wired Connectivity: The Echo has no wired inputs, meaning it can only play audio using the wireless capabilities described above.\n[17] Bluetooth is a wireless technology that allows you to connect nearby devices, even if they aren't in direct line of sight.

Source: Flickr/Dana Spiegel. Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are both methods that provide wireless communication, but the difference between the two mainly stems from what they are designed to do and how they are used. The main difference is that Bluetooth is primarily used to connect devices without using cables, while Wi-Fi provides high-speed access to the internet. Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard that is used to exchange data over short distances (less than 30 feet), usually between personal mobile devices.\n[2] Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are to some extent complementary in their applications and usage. Wi-Fi is usually access point-centered, with an asymmetrical client-server connection with all traffic routed through the access point, while Bluetooth is usually symmetrical, between two Bluetooth devices.\n[3] Bluetooth and WiFi are different standards for wireless communication. Bluetooth technology is useful when transferring information between two or more devices that are near each other when speed is not an issue, such as telephones, printers, modems and headsets.\n[4] Stockbyte/Stockbyte/Getty Images. Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are both wireless networking technologies. They transmit information via radio signals broadcast through the air rather than over wires, allowing devices to communicate with each other and share information.\n[5] Bluetooth or Wi-Fi: what's the difference? Here's the biggest difference: With Bluetooth, you stream music from your phone to a speaker. A Wi-Fi speaker accesses music from the internet, or from a computer on your home network. You can control a Wi-Fi speaker with your smartphone. You just have to stay within range of your Wi-Fi router's signal.\n[6] Bluetooth vs. WiFi - Range: Maximum range for Bluetooth based wireless connections is 30m while for Wi-Fi, it can extend well upto 100m. In Wi-Fi, range depends on the version of Wi-Fi protocol applied and addition of antennas in the communication system while no such concerns of range or extra antenna are much known in Bluetooth. . Bluetooth vs. WiFi - Devices Connected: In Bluetooth, upto 7 devices can be connected to each other (piconet) while in Wi-Fi, the maximum connections depend on Wi-Fi router which can accommodate 1 to several communicating devices at a time.\n[7] The choice of Bluetooth or WiFi is clear. Bluetooth is a universal standard and easy to use. But, its range is quite limited and sound quality is restricted. WiFi systems have a wider range and can offer excellent fidelity. But, different systems that use WiFi are incompatible, and setup may be difficult.\n[8] Wi-Fi is used for creating wireless local area networks, linking devices within about 100 meters of a central wireless access point. Bluetooth has a much smaller range and is used to create personal area networks of devices that are within about 10 meters of each other.\n[9] Bluetooth 4.0 vs. Wi-Fi Direct: Speed. Wi-Fi Direct promises device-to-device transfer speeds of up to 250Mbps, while Bluetooth 4.0 promises speeds similar to Bluetooth 3.0 of up to 25Mbps. Both Bluetooth 4.0 and Wi-Fi Direct use the 802.11 networking standard to reach their maximum speeds.\n[10] Bluetooth 4.0 vs. Wi-Fi Direct: Speed Wi-Fi Direct promises device-to-device transfer speeds of up to 250Mbps, while Bluetooth 4.0 promises speeds similar to Bluetooth 3.0 of up to 25Mbps.

USER: I will provide you with 20 passages, each indicated by a numerical identifier []. Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: hydrogen is a liquid below what temperature.\n\n[1] Hydrogen peroxide is the simplest form of peroxide, which is denoted as H2O2. It is a clear liquid with a boiling point of 150 oC. It is completely miscible with the water, however, can be completely separated by distillation because its boiling point is higher than that of water.\n[2] The more crowded and jumbled arrangement in liquid water can be sustained only by the greater amount of thermal energy available above the freezing point. [image source]. When ice melts, the more vigorous thermal motion disrupts much of the hydrogen-bonded structure, allowing the molecules to pack more closely. Water is thus one of the very few substances whose solid form has a lower density than the liquid at the freezing point.\n[3] Steam-Methane Reforming. Most hydrogen produced today in the United States is made via steam-methane reforming, a mature production process in which high-temperature steam (700\u00c2\u00b0C\u00e2\u0080\u00931,000\u00c2\u00b0C) is used to produce hydrogen from a methane source, such as natural gas.\n[4] It depends, liquid hydrogen is safer than H2 gas; H2 gas needed to be stored in pressurized containers, therefore it will be volatile. Liquid hydrogen burns efficiently and would be good to use as petrol-however I think there is a danger of explosion-high temp and pressure inside the engine of the car.he answer to that question is, yes, definitely!!! Hydrogen molecules and Oxygen molecules have a much lower energy state when combined to make the molecule H2O (water) than the total energy when they are separate molecules of hydrogen (H2) and Oxygen (O2).\n[5] The upper critical solution temperature (UCST) or upper consolute temperature is the critical temperature above which the components of a mixture are miscible in all proportions. solid state example is the palladium-hydrogen system which has a solid solution phase (H 2 in Pd) in equilibrium with a hydride phase (PdH n) below the UCST at 300 \u00c2\u00b0C. Above this temperature there is a single solid solution phase.\n[6] \u00c2\u00b7 just now. Report Abuse. Hydrogen is a gas, so it's neither shiny or dull. Hydrogen is also very explosive, so it conducting electricity isn't a good idea! (So, no...) I'm guessing the 298K is 298 Kelvin, a temperature measure, but I have no idea what it's related to. Joe B. \u00c2\u00b7 8 years ago. Thumbs up.\n[7] This is called hydrogenation. It includes the manufacture of margarine from animal or vegetable fats and oils. Hydrogenation in the lab The hydrogenation of ethene Ethene reacts with hydrogen in the presence of a finely divided nickel catalyst at a temperature of about 150\u00c2\u00b0C.\n[8] The standard enthalpy (heat) of formation for liquid water at 298K (25 o) is -286 kJ mol -1. 2 O (l) , is produced from its elements, hydrogen and oxygen, in their standard states, ie, H 2(g) and O 2(g) .\n[9] The standard enthalpy (heat) of formation for liquid water at 298K (25 o) is -286 kJ mol -1. 2 O (l) , is produced from its elements, hydrogen and oxygen, in their standard states, ie, H 2(g) and O 2(g) . 2 O (g) , is produced from its elements, hydrogen and oxygen, in their standard states, ie, H 2(g) and O 2(g) .\n[10] Entry 2: Vegetable Oils are usually liquids at room temperature. Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil is Vegetable Oil which has been hydrogenated to make it solid at room temperature. This can then been used to make spreads and margarines. Hydrogenation Process: Vegetable seeds are cleaned and bleached to remove all colour, taste, smells and impurities.\n[11] Above the core lies the main bulk of the planet in the form of liquid metallic hydrogen. This exotic form of the most common of elements is possible only at pressures exceeding 4 million bars, as is the case in the interior of Jupiter (and Saturn).\n[12] A solid state example is the palladium-hydrogen system which has a solid solution phase (H 2 in Pd) in equilibrium with a hydride phase (PdH n) below the UCST at 300 \u00c2\u00b0C. Above this temperature there is a single solid solution phase.In the phase diagram of the mixture components, the UCST is the shared maximum of the concave down spinodal and binodal (or coexistence) curves. The UCST is in general dependent on pressure. solid state example is the palladium-hydrogen system which has a solid solution phase (H 2 in Pd) in equilibrium with a hydride phase (PdH n) below the UCST at 300 \u00c2\u00b0C. Above this temperature there is a single solid solution phase.\n[13] Hydrogen is certainly not a colorful chemical element. But it has one surpassing feature. The hydrogen atom happens to be the smallest and lightest of all atomic elements. At temperatures above minus 423 degrees Fahrenheit, it boils and becomes the lightest of the gases.ydrogen is certainly not a colorful chemical element. But it has one surpassing feature. The hydrogen atom happens to be the smallest and lightest of all atomic elements. At temperatures above minus 423 degrees Fahrenheit, it boils and becomes the lightest of the gases.\n[14] The phase of most elements, at standard temperature and pressure, is solid. The exceptions are as follows: Gas: Hydrogen, Helium, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Fluorine, Neon, Chlorine, \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Argon, Krypton, Xenon, Radon. Liquid: Bromine, Mercury. Standard temperature and pressure (shortened to s.t.p.) are 293K (20oC) and 1atm (normal atmospheric pressure). 4 people found this useful.\n[15] *Water is one of the few substances that are less dense as a solid than as a liquid. While most substances contract when they solidify, water expands. This property is due to the hydrogen bonding. When water is above 4 \u00c2\u00b0C it behaves like other liquids; it expands as it warms and contracts when it cools.\n[16] The low temperature process is the second stage in the process, and is designed to take advantage of higher hydrogen equilibrium at low temperatures. The reaction is carried out between 200 \u00c2\u00b0C and 250 \u00c2\u00b0C, and the most commonly used catalyst is based on copper.\n[17] T2 High specific heat capacity. Water has the highest specific heat of all liquids except ammonia. The values for CV and CP are 4.1375 J g-1 K-1 and 4.1819 J g-1 K-1at 25 \u00c2\u00b0C respectively (compare CP pentane 1.66 J g-1 K-1). As water is heated, the increased movement of water causes the hydrogen bonds to bend and break.\n[18] Hydrogen is a chemical element with chemical symbol H and atomic number 1. With an atomic weight of 7000100794000000000\u00e2\u0099 1.00794 u, hydrogen is the lightest element on the periodic table.Its monatomic form (H) is the most abundant chemical substance in the universe, constituting roughly 75% of all baryonic mass. Non-remnant stars are mainly composed of hydrogen in its plasma state.ritium (hydrogen-3), produced in nuclear reactors, is used in the production of hydrogen bombs, as an isotopic label in the biosciences, and as a radiation source in luminous paints. The triple point temperature of equilibrium hydrogen is a defining fixed point on the ITS-90 temperature scale at 13.8033 kelvins.\n[19] At these pressures, hydrogen might exist as a liquid rather than solid. Liquid metallic hydrogen is thought to be present in large amounts in the gravitationally compressed interiors of Jupiter, Saturn, and in some extrasolar planets.\n[20] Thermacore, active in this field, has demonstrated a wide range of heat pipe/fluid systems for cryogenic thermal management, including helium at -270\u00c2\u00b0C (3K), hydrogen at -250\u00c2\u00b0C (23K), neon at -240\u00c2\u00b0C (33K) and oxygen at -220\u00c2\u00b0C (53K).\nSearch Query: hydrogen is a liquid below what temperature.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: hydrogen is a liquid below what temperature.\n\n[1] Give a reason for the fact that water, the hydride of oxygen, is a liquid at room temperature while the hydride of sulfur (the next member of Group 16) is a gas? (1.) Hydrogen fluoride is a liquid at room temperature and a weak acid but hydrogen chloride is a gas and a strong acid. Explain these facts. (2.) For similar reasons water and ammonia have unexpected properties.\n[2] But when they combine into the familiar compound known as water, each molecule of which contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom (H 2 O), the resulting substance is a liquid at room temperature and normal atmospheric pressure. The atoms of a few elements do not readily bond with other elements to form compounds.\n[3] Hydrogen bromide (along with hydrobromic acid) is produced by combining hydrogen and bromine at temperatures between 200-400 \u00c2\u00b0C. The reaction is typically catalyzed by platinum or asbestos.\n[4] hydrogen is flammable yes, but not very. because it is the least dense element it disperses very quickly meaning if it were to leak out of something it would disperse before it could ignite. It also burns very fast and has a higher ignition temperature than gasoline (gasoline is between 228 and 500, hydrogen is 550).\n[5] Hydrogen fluoride is a chemical compound with the chemical formula HF. This colorless gas or liquid is the principal industrial source of fluorine, often in the aqueous form as hydrofluoric acid, and thus is the precursor to many important compounds including pharmaceuticals and polymers (e.g. Teflon).F is widely used in the petrochemical industry and is a component of many superacids. Hydrogen fluoride boils near room temperature, while other hydrogen halides evaporate at much lower temperatures. Unlike other hydrogen halides, HF is lighter than air and diffuses relatively quickly through porous substances.\n[6] All of the above (Their outer layer is mainly hydrogen and helium, Below the surface there is a series of nested shells each made of a lighter element that the one below it, they have iron cores, the core temperature is about 2 billion degrees.)\n[7] Hydrogenation is the process that turns liquid oil into a more solid fat. Liquid oils are \u00e2\u0080\u0098hardened\u00e2\u0080\u0099 by adding hydrogen to stabilise the fat, making it easier to use in recipes for biscuits, cakes, pastry, and other processed foods.You can tell how \u00e2\u0080\u0098saturated\u00e2\u0080\u0099 a fat is by its texture at room temperature.ome evidence suggests that the effects of these trans fats may be worse than saturated fats. So, as part of a healthy diet we should try to reduce the amount of foods we eat that contain hydrogenated or saturated fats and replace them with unsaturated fats.\n[8] Even though a hydrogen bond is only 5% as strong as a covalent bond, it's enough to stabilize water molecules. Hydrogen bonding causes water to remain liquid over a wide temperature range. Because it takes extra energy to break hydrogen bonds, water has an unusually high heat of vaporization. Water has a much higher boiling point than other hydrides. There are many important consequences of the effects of hydrogen bonding between water molecules: 1 Hydrogen bonding makes ice less dense than liquid water, so ice floats on water. 2 The effect of hydrogen bonding on heat of vaporization helps make perspiration an effective means of lowering temperature for animals.\n[9] Liquid water is exceptional in having approximately as many hydrogen bonds as it has covalent bonds. Shown right is the number of hydrogen bonds per water molecule as the temperature rises with the line-width showing the approximate disparity between different experimental methods (data from [ 2264 ]).uch cooperativity is a fundamental property of liquid water where hydrogen bonds are up to 250% stronger than the single hydrogen bond in the dimer [ 77 ]. A strong base at the end of a chain may strengthen the bonding further.\n[10] The temperature of the first maximum of hydrogen consumption depends on the number K and shifts due to its increase from 800 \u00c2\u00b1 5 K (laboratory E-2) to 850 \u00c2\u00b1 30 K (laboratories CH-1, D-1, F-2, F-3 Set 2 and 3) and finally to 955 K (laboratory F-3 Set 1).\n[11] Hydrogen is certainly not a colorful chemical element. But it has one surpassing feature. The hydrogen atom happens to be the smallest and lightest of all atomic elements.

While most substances contract when they solidify, water expands. This property is due to the hydrogen bonding. When water is above 4 \u00c2\u00b0C it behaves like other liquids; it expands as it warms and contracts when it cools.\n[13] Hydrogen peroxide is the simplest form of peroxide, which is denoted as H2O2. It is a clear liquid with a boiling point of 150 oC. It is completely miscible with the water, however, can be completely separated by distillation because its boiling point is higher than that of water.\n[14] The more crowded and jumbled arrangement in liquid water can be sustained only by the greater amount of thermal energy available above the freezing point. [image source]. When ice melts, the more vigorous thermal motion disrupts much of the hydrogen-bonded structure, allowing the molecules to pack more closely. Water is thus one of the very few substances whose solid form has a lower density than the liquid at the freezing point.\n[15] At these pressures, hydrogen might exist as a liquid rather than solid. Liquid metallic hydrogen is thought to be present in large amounts in the gravitationally compressed interiors of Jupiter, Saturn, and in some extrasolar planets.\n[16] Above the core lies the main bulk of the planet in the form of liquid metallic hydrogen. This exotic form of the most common of elements is possible only at pressures exceeding 4 million bars, as is the case in the interior of Jupiter (and Saturn).\n[17] Entry 2: Vegetable Oils are usually liquids at room temperature. Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil is Vegetable Oil which has been hydrogenated to make it solid at room temperature. This can then been used to make spreads and margarines. Hydrogenation Process: Vegetable seeds are cleaned and bleached to remove all colour, taste, smells and impurities.\n[18] This is called hydrogenation. It includes the manufacture of margarine from animal or vegetable fats and oils. Hydrogenation in the lab The hydrogenation of ethene Ethene reacts with hydrogen in the presence of a finely divided nickel catalyst at a temperature of about 150\u00c2\u00b0C.\n[19] The low temperature process is the second stage in the process, and is designed to take advantage of higher hydrogen equilibrium at low temperatures. The reaction is carried out between 200 \u00c2\u00b0C and 250 \u00c2\u00b0C, and the most commonly used catalyst is based on copper.\n[20] The upper critical solution temperature (UCST) or upper consolute temperature is the critical temperature above which the components of a mixture are miscible in all proportions. solid state example is the palladium-hydrogen system which has a solid solution phase (H 2 in Pd) in equilibrium with a hydride phase (PdH n) below the UCST at 300 \u00c2\u00b0C. Above this temperature there is a single solid solution phase.\nSearch Query: hydrogen is a liquid below what temperature.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

A series of promoted ruthenium-based catalysts supported on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT) were used for the production of hydrogen via decomposition of ammonia at low temperatures (below 650 K).\n[3] Ice is the solid form that liquid water takes when it is cooled below 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit). Ice melts due to the chemical properties of water. There are more hydrogen bonds between the molecules of ice than in water. Ice begins to melt when its temperature exceeds 0 degrees Celsius and hydrogen bonds between water molecules break.\n[4] Hydrogen gas forms explosive mixtures with air if it is 4\u00e2\u0080\u009374% concentrated and with chlorine if it is 5\u00e2\u0080\u009395% concentrated.

Hydrogen has a melting point of -259.14 \u00c2\u00b0C and a boiling point of -252.87 \u00c2\u00b0C.\n[6] Interesting Facts about Hydrogen. 1 Scientists estimate that Hydrogen makes up over 90 percent of all the atoms in the universe. 2 It is the only element that can exist without neutrons. 3 Hydrogen becomes a liquid at very low temperature and high pressure. 4 Around 10 percent of the mass of the human body is hydrogen.\n[7] Liquid water is exceptional in having approximately as many hydrogen bonds as it has covalent bonds. Shown right is the number of hydrogen bonds per water molecule as the temperature rises with the line-width showing the approximate disparity between different experimental methods (data from [ 2264 ]).\n[8] On the other hand, the molecules in liquid water are held together by relatively strong hydrogen bonds, and its enthalpy of vaporization, 40.65 kJ/mol, is more than five times the energy required to heat the same quantity of water from 0 \u00c2\u00b0C to 100 \u00c2\u00b0C (c p = 75.3 J K \u00e2\u0088\u00921 mol \u00e2\u0088\u00921).\n[9] A clear, liquid compound of hydrogen and oxygen, H2O.

The atoms of a few elements do not readily bond with other elements to form compounds.\n[15] *Water is one of the few substances that are less dense as a solid than as a liquid. While most substances contract when they solidify, water expands. This property is due to the hydrogen bonding. When water is above 4 \u00c2\u00b0C it behaves like other liquids; it expands as it warms and contracts when it cools.\n[16] Even though a hydrogen bond is only 5% as strong as a covalent bond, it's enough to stabilize water molecules. Hydrogen bonding causes water to remain liquid over a wide temperature range. Because it takes extra energy to break hydrogen bonds, water has an unusually high heat of vaporization. Water has a much higher boiling point than other hydrides. There are many important consequences of the effects of hydrogen bonding between water molecules: 1 Hydrogen bonding makes ice less dense than liquid water, so ice floats on water. 2 The effect of hydrogen bonding on heat of vaporization helps make perspiration an effective means of lowering temperature for animals.\n[17] Liquid water is exceptional in having approximately as many hydrogen bonds as it has covalent bonds. Shown right is the number of hydrogen bonds per water molecule as the temperature rises with the line-width showing the approximate disparity between different experimental methods (data from [ 2264 ]).uch cooperativity is a fundamental property of liquid water where hydrogen bonds are up to 250% stronger than the single hydrogen bond in the dimer [ 77 ]. A strong base at the end of a chain may strengthen the bonding further.\n[18] Give a reason for the fact that water, the hydride of oxygen, is a liquid at room temperature while the hydride of sulfur (the next member of Group 16) is a gas? (1.) Hydrogen fluoride is a liquid at room temperature and a weak acid but hydrogen chloride is a gas and a strong acid. Explain these facts. (2.) For similar reasons water and ammonia have unexpected properties.\n[19] Hydrogen fluoride is a chemical compound with the chemical formula HF. This colorless gas or liquid is the principal industrial source of fluorine, often in the aqueous form as hydrofluoric acid, and thus is the precursor to many important compounds including pharmaceuticals and polymers (e.g. Teflon).F is widely used in the petrochemical industry and is a component of many superacids. Hydrogen fluoride boils near room temperature, while other hydrogen halides evaporate at much lower temperatures. Unlike other hydrogen halides, HF is lighter than air and diffuses relatively quickly through porous substances.\n[20] Hydrogen peroxide is the simplest form of peroxide, which is denoted as H2O2.

The lower portion of the tank holds the liquid hydrogen, which is the fuel for the engines. The second-coldest known chemical, it is stored in the tank at minus 423 degrees Fahrenheit.\n[2] Hydrogen cyanide (HCN), sometimes called prussic acid, is an organic compound with the chemical formula HCN. It is a colorless, extremely poisonous liquid that boils slightly above room temperature, at 25.6 \u00c2\u00b0C (78.1 \u00c2\u00b0F).ydrogen cyanide is a linear molecule, with a triple bond between carbon and nitrogen. A minor tautomer of HCN is HNC, hydrogen isocyanide. Hydrogen cyanide is weakly acidic with a pKa of 9.2. It partially ionizes in water solution to give the cyanide anion, CN \u00e2\u0088\u0092 .\n[3] However, the hydrogen bond strength in supercooled liquid water may be stronger than in ice [2020]. The hydrogen bond strength is almost five times the average thermal collision fluctuation at 25 \u00c2\u00b0C) to a neighboring oxygen atom of another water molecule and is far greater than any included van der Waals interaction.\n[4] The electronegativity difference between the oxygen and hydrogen atoms in water molecules is responsible for the establishing of hydrogen bonds between molecules. It is the mutual attraction of water molecules that accounts for the ability of water to remain liquid over a broad range of temperature (0oC-100oC) and also for its high heat of vaporization and high heat capacity.\n[5] Hydrogen Bonding Water is a liquid at room temperature due to the presence of hydrogen bonds between water molecules. The state of a molecule is determined by intermo \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 lecular forces, such as dipole-dipole interactions, Van der Waals forces (also called London dispersion forces), and hydrogen bonds.t 4oC the density is approximately 1000 kg/m3 (or 1 g/cm3) - more acurately though the density would be 999.97 kg/m3 (or \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 0.9997 g/cm3).

At room temperature (22oC) The density of water is 997.77 kg/m3 (or 0.99777 g/cm3).\n[6] Nascent Hydrogen. The hydrogen gas, which is just liberated as a result of a chemical is called nascent hydrogen or newly born hydrogen. It is obtained by passing dihydrogen gas at atmospheric pressure through an electric arc between two tungsten rods. The electric arc maintains a temperature around 4000 - 4500\u00c2\u00b0C.\n[7] Its hydrogen bonding causes its many unique properties, such as having a solid form less dense than its liquid form, a relatively high boiling point of 100 \u00c2\u00b0C for its molar mass, and a high heat capacity.

This layer probably also contains some helium and traces of various ices .\n[9] Mercury and water are both liquid at room temperature and 1 atmosphere of pressure. You can make water boil, however, by putting it in a vacuum! Boiling is the process of a substance changing from liquid to gas phase.or Hydrogen, the boiling point is -253 degrees Celsius; for Mercury it is 357 degrees Celsius, and for Iron it is 2,750 degrees Celsius. From these numbers you can see that at room temperature (and indeed for nearly any temperature found on Earth) Hydrogen is a gas, Mercury is a liquid, and Iron is a solid.\n[10] Its hydrogen bonding causes its many unique properties, such as having a solid form less dense than its liquid form, a relatively high boiling point of 100 \u00c2\u00b0C for its molar mass, and a high heat capacity.

As a result of the network of hydrogen bonding present between water molecules, a high input of energy is required to transform one gram of liquid water into water vapor, an energy requirement called the heat of vaporization.\n[6] Examples include butane, acetylene, methane and hydrogen. Flammable liquids are identified as liquids that have a flashpoint (minimum temperature needed for the liquid to produce a vapor with enough of a concentration to ignite) below 100 degrees Fahrenheit (F). There is an exception to this definition. If any of the components of the mixture have flashpoints of 100 deg. F or higher, then the material is classified as combustible rather than flammable. Another way to identify flammable liquids is by class. It is important to remember that with flammable liquids that it is the vapor coming off of the liquid that will ignite and burn, not necessarily the liquid itself.\n[7] Methane's boiling point is about 110K, compared to hydrogen's 20K. This means that both fuel and oxidizer lines can be purged with gaseous nitrogen. Liquid hydrogen lines can only be purged with helium, as hydrogen's boiling point is below the melting point of other inert gases.\n[8] Formic acid contains 53 g L \u00e2\u0088\u00921 hydrogen at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.

In fact, it is a lot less denser than gasoline. This means that it has to be compressed to liquid state and stored the same way at lower temperatures to guarantee its effectiveness and efficiency as an energy source.\n[10] The boiling point of H 2O 2 has been extrapolated as being 150.2 \u00c2\u00b0C, approximately 50 degrees higher than water; in practice hydrogen peroxide will undergo potentially explosive thermal decomposition if heated to this temperature.

It is very volatile, readily producing flammable and toxic concentrations at room temperature. Hydrogen cyanide gas mixes well with air, and explosive mixtures are easily formed.\n[4] Other molecules, as small as water (eg CO2), change from liquid to gas at temperatures far below that of water. It is also the Hydrogen bond which is responsible for the large amount of heat energy needed to convert water from liquid to gas.\n[5] (Redirected from Hydrogen cyanide gas) Hydrogen cyanide (HCN), sometimes called prussic acid, is a chemical compound with the chemical formula HCN. It is a colorless, extremely poisonous and flammable liquid that boils slightly above room temperature, at 25.6 \u00c2\u00b0C (78.1 \u00c2\u00b0F).\n[6] Hydrogen Bonding Water is a liquid at room temperature due to the presence of hydrogen bonds between water molecules. The state of a molecule is determined by intermo\u00e2\u0080\u00a6lecular forces, such as dipole-dipole interactions, Van der Waals forces (also called London dispersion forces), and hydrogen bonds.\n[7] At room temperature hydrogen is a gas. It is a colorless, tasteless and odorless gas. It is the lightest gas. It is insoluble in water. It is highly inflammable and burns with blue flame forming water. Liquefication temperature of hydrogen is -252oC. Bond energy of H-H is 431 Kj/mole. Electro negativity of hydrogen is 2.1.\n[8] The density of liquid hydrogen is only 70.99 g/L (at 20 K), a relative density of just 0.07. Although the specific energy is around twice that of other fuels, this gives it a remarkably low volumetric energy density, many fold lower.\n[9] Hydrogen cyanide. Hydrogen cyanide (HCN), sometimes called prussic acid, is a chemical compound with the chemical formula HCN. It is a colorless, extremely poisonous and flammable liquid that boils slightly above room temperature, at 25.6 \u00c2\u00b0C (78.1 \u00c2\u00b0F).\n[10] While below 4 \u00c2\u00b0C the breakage of hydrogen bonds due to heating allows water molecules to pack closer despite the increase in the thermal motion (which tends to expand a liquid), above 4 \u00c2\u00b0C water expands as the temperature increases. Water near the boiling point is about 4% less dense than water at 4 \u00c2\u00b0C (39 \u00c2\u00b0F).\n[11] Interesting Facts about Hydrogen. 1 Scientists estimate that Hydrogen makes up over 90 percent of all the atoms in the universe. 2 It is the only element that can exist without neutrons. 3 Hydrogen becomes a liquid at very low temperature and high pressure. Under extremely high pressure it can become a liquid metal.\n[12] 1 Liquid metallic hydrogen: Helium is a liquid at normal pressure and temperatures near absolute zero, a result of its high zero-point energy (ZPE), the lowest possible energy.\n[13] At high pressure and temperatures, metallic hydrogen might exist as a liquid rather than a solid, and researchers think it is present in large amounts in the hot and gravitationally compressed interiors of Jupiter, Saturn, and in some extrasolar planets.\n[14] At the temperature and pressure of Jupiter's interior hydrogen is a liquid, not a gas. It is an electrical conductor and the source of Jupiter's magnetic field. This layer probably also contains some helium and traces of various ices .\n[15] At these pressures, hydrogen might exist as a liquid rather than solid. Liquid metallic hydrogen is thought to be present in large amounts in the gravitationally compressed interiors of Jupiter, Saturn, and in some extrasolar planets.\n[16] One of hydrogen properties is that it has a lower density. In fact, it is a lot less denser than gasoline. This means that it has to be compressed to liquid state and stored the same way at lower temperatures to guarantee its effectiveness and efficiency as an energy source.\n[17] The main job of the tank is to hold about 535,000 gallons of super cold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. The lower portion of the tank holds the liquid hydrogen, which is the fuel for the engines. The second-coldest known chemical, it is stored in the tank at minus 423 degrees Fahrenheit.\n[18] Hydrogen is certainly not a colorful chemical element. But it has one surpassing feature. The hydrogen atom happens to be the smallest and lightest of all atomic elements. At temperatures above minus 423 degrees Fahrenheit, it boils and becomes the lightest of the gases.ydrogen is certainly not a colorful chemical element. But it has one surpassing feature. The hydrogen atom happens to be the smallest and lightest of all atomic elements. At temperatures above minus 423 degrees Fahrenheit, it boils and becomes the lightest of the gases.\n[19] Water in its liquid form has an unusually high boiling point temperature, a value close to 100\u00c2\u00b0C. As a result of the network of hydrogen bonding present between water molecules, a high input of energy is required to transform one gram of liquid water into water vapor, an energy requirement called the heat of vaporization.\n[20] Ice is the solid form that liquid water takes when it is cooled below 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit). Ice melts due to the chemical properties of water. There are more hydrogen bonds between the molecules of ice than in water. Ice begins to melt when its temperature exceeds 0 degrees Celsius and hydrogen bonds between water molecules break.\nSearch Query: hydrogen is a liquid below what temperature.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

For hydrogen to become a liquid, you need to cool it down to 20.28 K, which is -252.87 degrees Celcius, or -434.45 degrees Fahrenheit if that is more your style. 6 people found this useful.\n[15] What is the temperature of the gas turn to liquid? Every gas has a different liquidation temperature based on what element it is. Hydrogen has a liquidation point of 423.17 degrees below zero F.\n[16] Hydrogen's state of matter is gas at standard conditions of temperature and pressure. Hydrogen condenses into a liquid or freezes solid at extremely cold... Hydrogen's state of matter is gas at standard conditions of temperature and pressure. Hydrogen condenses into a liquid or freezes solid at extremely cold temperatures. Hydrogen's state of matter can change when the temperature changes, becoming a liquid at temperatures between minus 423.18 and minus 434.49 degrees Fahrenheit. It becomes a solid at temperatures below minus 434.49 F.Due to its high flammability, hydrogen gas is commonly used in combustion reactions, such as in rocket and automobile fuels.\n[17] Hydrogen occurs as a gas that you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t smell. It is about 14 times lighter than air. When you combine two atoms of hydrogen with one atom of oxygen you get a water molecule H 2O. Like nitrogen, hydrogen can also be condensed to a liquid that freezes at \u00e2\u0080\u0093 259\u00c2\u00b0C (-434\u00c2\u00b0F) and boils at -252\u00c2\u00b0C (-423\u00c2\u00b0F). Hydrogen is one of the most common elements in our universe. The sun and many stars are made of hydrogen.\n[18] When you combine two atoms of hydrogen with one atom of oxygen you get a water molecule H 2O. Like nitrogen, hydrogen can also be condensed to a liquid that freezes at \u00e2\u0080\u0093 259\u00c2\u00b0C (-434\u00c2\u00b0F) and boils at -252\u00c2\u00b0C (-423\u00c2\u00b0F). Hydrogen is one of the most common elements in our universe.\n[19] Hydrogen is the lightest, simplest and most commonly found chemical element in the Universe, making up around 75% of its elemental mass. Hydrogen is found in large amounts in giant gas planets and stars, it plays a key role in powering stars through fusion reactions.Hydrogen is one of two important elements found in water (H 2 O). Each molecule of water is made up of two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom.In 1766, during an acid metal reaction, Henry Cavendish first formally recognized hydrogen.In 1781 he also found that hydrogen produces water when burned.ydrogen can exist as a liquid under high pressure and an extremely low temperature of 20.28 kelvin (\u00e2\u0088\u0092252.87\u00c2\u00b0C, \u00e2\u0088\u0092423.17 \u00c2\u00b0F). Hydrogen is often stored in this way as liquid hydrogen takes up less space than hydrogen in its normal gas form. Liquid hydrogen is also used as a rocket fuel.\n[20] For Hydrogen, the boiling point is -253 degrees Celsius; for Mercury it is 357 degrees Celsius, and for Iron it is 2,750 degrees Celsius. From these numbers you can see that at room temperature (and indeed for nearly any temperature found on Earth) Hydrogen is a gas, Mercury is a liquid, and Iron is a solid.\nSearch Query: hydrogen is a liquid below what temperature.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

The social determinants of health are the circumstances in which people are born, grow up, live, work and age, and the systems put in place to deal with illness. These circumstances are in turn shaped by a wider set of forces: economics, social policies, and politics.\n[3] The social determinants of health (SDH) are the social and economic factors that influence people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health. These are apparent in the living and working conditions that people experience every day. The SDH influence health in many positive and negative ways.he social gradient not only represents the effects of income on health but also the importance of income as a means of gaining access to other social determinants of health such as education, food, housing, recreational activities, and other societal resources.\n[4] Social determinants of health reflect the social factors and physical conditions of the environment in which people are born, live, learn, play, work, and age. Also known as social and physical determinants of health, they impact a wide range of health, functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes. Examples of social determinants include: Availability of resources to meet daily needs, such as educational and job opportunities, living wages, or healthful foods.\n[5] The social determinants of health are linked to the economic and social conditions and their distribution among the population that influence individual and group differences in health status. They are health promoting factors found in one's living and working conditions, rather than individual risk factors that influence the risk for a disease, or vulnerability to disease or injury. According to some viewpoints, the distributions of social determinants are shaped by public policies that reflect\n[6] Social determinants of health reflect the social factors and physical conditions of the environment in which people are born, live, learn, play, work, and age.

These circumstances are shaped by the distribution of money, power and resources at global, national and local levels. The social determinants of health are mostly responsible for health inequities - the unfair and avoidable differences in health status seen within and between countries. Key concepts\n[8] Social Determinants of Health. The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines the social determinants of health as the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age. These circumstances are shaped by the distribution of money, power and resources at global, national and local levels.\n[9] Social Determinants of Health. The complex, integrated, and overlapping social structures and economic systems that are responsible for most health inequities.

The social determinants of health (SDH) are the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age, and the wider set of forces and systems shaping the conditions of daily life.\n[15] Determinants of health are factors that contribute to a person's current state of health. These factors may be biological, socioeconomic, psychosocial, behavioral, or social in nature. Scientists generally recognize five determinants of health of a population [2, 3]: 1 Genes and biology: for example, sex and age.hese social determinants of health also interact with and influence individual behaviors as well. More specifically, social determinants of health refer to the set of factors that contribute to the social patterning of health, disease, and illness.\n[16] Social Determinants of Health. The complex, integrated, and overlapping social structures and economic systems that are responsible for most health inequities. These social structures and economic systems include the social environment, physical environment, health services, and structural and societal factors. Social determinants of health are shaped by the distribution of money, power, and resources throughout local communities, nations, and the world [9]. Socioeconomic Gradient in Health This term refers to the stepwise fashion health outcomes improve as socioeconomic position improves.\n[17] The social determinants of health (SDOH) are defined by the idea that health is determined by the social, economic, and physical environments in which people live and work, as well as by individuals\u00e2\u0080\u0099 particular\n[18] The social determinants of health (SDOH) are linked to the economic and social conditions and their distribution among the population that influence individual and group differences in health status.\n[19] Understanding Social Determinants of Health.

Specifically the percentile represents the percentage of the sample that falls below this observation. For example, the median is also known as the. 50th percentile because half of the data or 50% of the observations lie below the median.

Proportion of the distribution between the mean and 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations The mean and 1 standard deviation is 34.13 percent. 1 and 2 standard deviations is 13.59 percent. 2 and 3 standard deviations is 2.15 percent.\n[6] They have shown that only 2.3% of the population will be less than or equal to a score two standard deviations below the mean. (click here to see why 70 is two standard deviations below the mean.) In terms of the Introductory Psychology test example, this means that a person scoring 70 would be in the 2.3rd percentile.This graph shows the distribution of scores on the test. The shaded area is 2.3% of the total area.f the mean and standard deviation of a normal distribution are known, it is relatively easy to figure out the percentile rank of a person obtaining a specific score.\n[7] Definition: A percent is a ratio whose second term is 100. Percent means parts per hundred. The word comes from the Latin phrase per centum, which means per hundred. In mathematics, we use the symbol % for percent.\n[8] The 1-5% range places water vapor as the third most common gas (which alters the other percentages accordingly). Answer: This is composition of air in percent by volume, at sea level at 15\u00c2\u00b0C and 101325 Pa. Nitrogen -- N 2 -- 78.084%. Oxygen -- O 2 -- 20.9476%. Argon -- Ar -- 0.934%.

As for page, do you mean a printed page? I can't think of what else it would be (except for a congressional page, and I don't know how you get 3/4 of that). So, if it's a printed page, to imagine it, fold it in half, then in half again (folding from top to bottom). The second fold gives you four equal parts, and 3/4 would be three of those four. T J \u00c2\u00b7 8 years ago.\n[10] Percent solutions can take the form of weight/volume % (wt/vol % or w/v %), weight/weight % (wt/wt % or w/w %), or volume/volume % (vol/vol % or v/v %). In each case, the percentage concentration is calculated as the fraction of the weight or volume of the solute related to the total weight or volume of the solution.Because percent solutions can be expressed in three different ways, it is imperative that the type of percent solution be explicitly stated.If this information is not provided, the end user is left to guess whether w/v %, w/w %, or v/v % was used.or example, a 70 % (v/v) solution of ethanol can be prepared by dissolving 70 mL of 100% (i.e., 200 proof) ethanol in a total solution volume of 100 mL. Other factors may also be important when deciding on the type of percent solution to prepare.\n[11] Difference between the first quartile (25th percentile) and the third quartile (75th percentile) of an ordered range of data. It contains middle 50 percent of the distribution and is unaffected by extreme values. Half of this range (25 percent or the distribution) is called semi-interquartile range.\n[12] Best Answer: To convert a percent to a fraction: 1. Remove the percent sign. 2. Create a fraction by placing the number over 100. 3. If the numerator is a decimal, continue multiplying the numerator and denominator by 10 until the numerator becomes a whole number.4. Reduce the fraction to its simplest form. 66 2/3% = 66 2/3 / 100 66 2/3 / 100 = 2/3.Source(s):6 2/3% (66*3+2)/3 200/3% (200/3)*(1/100) 2/3 0.66667.\n[13] The 1-5% range places water vapor as the third most common gas (which alters the other percentages accordingly).

For the normal distribution, the values less than one standard deviation away from the mean account for 68.27% of the set; while two standard deviations from the mean account for 95.45%; and three standard deviations account for 99.73%.n the empirical sciences the so-called three-sigma rule of thumb expresses a conventional heuristic that nearly all values are taken to lie within three standard deviations of the mean, i.e. that it is empirically useful to treat 99.7% probability as near certainty.\n[15] 100%, then, represents the whole. When you are trying to figure out what percentage is of something, you simply divide the numerator by the denominator and multiply it by 100. So if the equation was 2/3=what percent...\n[16] One possible complication is the development of. increased pain in the distribution of the third occipital nerve (3ON). This has been documented to. range from 2% to 55% of patients following cervical RFA. Our study aims to identify the incidence of. increased pain as result of radiofrequency neurotomy of the 3ON.\n[17] Answers. Best Answer: Percent means divide by 100. So: 26% = 26/100 = 13/50 As a decimal, 26/100 = .26 .13 = 13/100 = 13% I'll let you do the third.\n[18] We were even more surprised when a reader wrote in telling us about a rule of three in statistics. According to Wikipedia: the rule of three states that if a certain event did not occur in a sample with n subjects \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the interval from 0 to 3/n is a 95% confidence interval for the rate of occurrences in the population.\n[19] Although 3CR12 is recognised as the World's most specified 12% Chromium utility steel, it is by no means universal and should not be substituted for higher grades of stainless steel unless detailed corrosion testing has been carried out.Columbus Stainless can be consulted for advice in this regard.ustenitic stainless steel filler metals such as AWS ER 309L, 308L, or 316L should be used. In order to ensure adequate corrosion resistance in weld zones, it is necessary to remove all heat tint by pickling or by some mechanical means and passivating with a cold 10% nitric acid solution after cleaning.\n[20] Most third parties are outshined by the two major parties, but some, like Ralph Nader's Green Party, get to have some coverage in the news and gain a good percentage of votes.

Quintiles are not that commonly used. Decile. Obviously, the fifth decile is the median, as it is the middle value in the data set. Also, the third decile splits the data set into the lower 30% of values and the upper 70% of values, and so on.There are 99 percentiles in the data set.uartiles, quintiles, deciles, and percentiles. Quartile. You should note that Q 1 effectively splits the data set into the lower 25% of values and the upper 75% of values, whereas Q 3 splits the data into the lower 75% of values and the upper 25% of values.\n[10] Not to be confused with Percentile function. A percentile (or a centile) is a measure used in statistics indicating the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations fall. For example, the 20th percentile is the value (or score) below which 20% of the observations may be found. The term percentile and the related term percentile rank are often used in the reporting of scores from norm-referenced tests.\n[11] Sometimes, a restaurant operator may ponder, Is it worth stirring the pot with a vendor over three dollars?. The answer is YES it is worth it. In this instance, the three dollars represents 3% percent of $100. If you apply the three dollars to $3,000,000 in gross sales you have $90,000 that you pick up in profit. Now let's talk operating expenses.\n[12] Some 18% of American adults own only one of the three devices. Among single-device owners, 60% say they have a desktop or laptop computer, compared with a third (34%) whose only device is a smartphone, while 7% report their sole device as a tablet.\n[13] A 3% margin of error means that if the same procedure is used a large number of times, 95% of the time the true population average will be within the 95% confidence interval of the sample estimate plus or minus 3%.\n[14] Three 4G.

Specifically the percentile represents the percentage of the sample that falls below this observation. For example, the median is also known as the. 50th percentile because half of the data or 50% of the observations lie below the median. Table 4.4 displays three percentiles that will be of interest to us. Figure 4.7 shows these percentiles (quartiles) graphically.

(click here to see why 70 is two standard deviations below the mean.) In terms of the Introductory Psychology test example, this means that a person scoring 70 would be in the 2.3rd percentile.This graph shows the distribution of scores on the test. The shaded area is 2.3% of the total area.f the mean and standard deviation of a normal distribution are known, it is relatively easy to figure out the percentile rank of a person obtaining a specific score.\n[19] Difference between the first quartile (25th percentile) and the third quartile (75th percentile) of an ordered range of data. It contains middle 50 percent of the distribution and is unaffected by extreme values. Half of this range (25 percent or the distribution) is called semi-interquartile range.\n[20] From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. For the normal distribution, the values less than one standard deviation away from the mean account for 68.27% of the set; while two standard deviations from the mean account for 95.45%; and three standard deviations account for 99.73%.n the empirical sciences the so-called three-sigma rule of thumb expresses a conventional heuristic that nearly all values are taken to lie within three standard deviations of the mean, i.e. that it is empirically useful to treat 99.7% probability as near certainty.\nSearch Query: what are the three percenters?.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

It could also be a symptom of infection, or a problem with the urinary tract, lower intestines, rectum, muscle or bone.\n[2] Causes. Usually, pelvic pain is not caused by a serious disorder. It is often related to the menstrual cycle. However, several disorders that cause pelvic pain can lead to peritonitis (inflammation and usually infection of the abdominal cavity), which is a serious disorder.sually, pelvic pain is not caused by a serious disorder. It is often related to the menstrual cycle. However, several disorders that cause pelvic pain can lead to peritonitis (inflammation and usually infection of the abdominal cavity), which is a serious disorder.\n[3] Adhesions and Chronic Pelvic Pain (CPP). ADHESIONS are believed to cause pelvic pain by tethering down organs and tissues, causing traction (pulling) of nerves. Nerve endings may become entrapped within a developing adhesion. If the bowel becomes obstructed, distention will cause pain. Some patients in whom chronic pelvic pain has lasted more than six months may develop Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome. In addition to the chronic pain, emotional and behavioral changes appear due to the duration of the pain and its associated stress.\n[4] Female pelvic pain is typically caused by a medical condition involving the reproductive organs, urinary tract, lower gastrointestinal tract, or muscles of the abdominal wall. Some causes are always short-term (acute), and others can become long-lasting (chronic) unless successfully treated.\n[5] Endometriosis may cause pelvic pain, especially during menstruation. Hormones of the menstrual cycle cause the endometriosis to bleed each month. This can be painful and result in the formation of pelvic adhesions, also known as scar tissue. Blood trapped in the ovary can build up into a cyst.\n[6] What Is Pelvic Pain? If you have pain below your belly button and above your legs, it counts as pelvic pain. It can be caused by a lot of things. It may be a harmless sign that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re fertile, a digestive disorder, or a red flag that you need to go to the hospital.\n[7] If caused by a disorder, pelvic pain may be accompanied by other symptoms, including vaginal bleeding (Vaginal Bleeding During Early Pregnancy ). In some disorders, such bleeding can be severe, sometimes leading to dangerously low blood pressure (shock).\n[8] The following conditions often cause lower right abdominal pain 1 : Appendicitis. 2 Cancer. 3 Cholecystitis (gallbladder inflammation). 4 Diverticulitis. 5 Problems with the cervix, such as a cervical infection, inflamed cervix or growths on the cervix. 6 Endometriosis. 7 Inguinal hernia. 8 Injury. 9 Intestinal obstruction.\n[9] Pain in the pelvic area can come from conditions affecting a variety of organs. These organs include the bladder and rectum in both men and women as well as the uterus, ovaries, and Fallopian tubes in women.\n[10] 8 Common Causes of Feminine Pelvic Pain. 2. Endometriosis. Approximately 5 million women suffer with endometriosis, a chronic condition in which cells grow and spread outside the uterus and painfully break down when the uterine lining is shed during your monthly menstrual period. The symptoms of endometriosis include painful abdominal cramps as well as pain in the lower back and legs.\n[11] Chronic pelvic pain is pain in the area below your bellybutton and between your hips that lasts six months or longer. Chronic pelvic pain can have multiple causes. It can be a symptom of another disease, or it can be a condition in its own right. If your chronic pelvic pain appears to be caused by another medical problem, treating that problem may be enough to eliminate your pain.\n[12] Endometriosis may cause pelvic pain, especially during menstruation. Hormones of the menstrual cycle cause the endometriosis to bleed each month. This can be painful and result in the formation of pelvic adhesions, also known as scar tissue.\n[13] Pelvic pain is pain in the lowest part of your abdomen and pelvis. In women, pelvic pain may refer to symptoms arising from the reproductive or urinary systems or from musculoskeletal sources. Depending on its source, pelvic pain may be dull or sharp; it may be constant or off and on (intermittent); and it may be mild, moderate or severe. Pelvic pain can sometimes radiate to your lower back, buttocks or thighs. Pelvic pain can occur suddenly, sharply and briefly (acute) or over the long term (chronic). Chronic pelvic pain refers to any constant or intermittent pelvic pain that has been present for more than a few months. Sometimes, you may notice pelvic pain only at certain times, such as when you urinate or during sexual activity. 1 Causes.\n[14] Organs in your pelvis include your bowel, bladder, womb (uterus) and ovaries. Pelvic pain usually means pain that starts from one of these organs. In some cases the pain comes from your pelvic bones that lie next to these organs, or from nearby muscles, nerves, blood vessels or joints. So, there are many causes of pelvic pain. Pelvic pain is more common in women than in men.\n[15] The following conditions often cause lower right abdominal pain 1 : Appendicitis. 2 Cancer. 3 Cholecystitis (gallbladder inflammation). 4 Diverticulitis. 5 Problems with the cervix, such as a cervical infection, inflamed cervix or growths on the cervix. 6 Endometriosis. 7 Inguinal hernia. 8 Injury.\n[16] Abdominal pain. Appendicitis usually involves a gradual onset of dull, cramping, or aching pain throughout the abdomen. As the appendix becomes more swollen and inflamed, it will irritate the lining of the abdominal wall, known as the peritoneum. This causes localized, sharp pain in the right lower part of the abdomen. The pain tends to be more constant and severe than the dull, aching pain that occurs when symptoms start. However, some people may have an appendix that lies behind the colon. Appendicitis that occurs in these people can cause lower back pain or pelvic pain. Mild fever. Appendicitis usually causes a fever between 99\u00c2\u00b0F (37.2\u00c2\u00b0C) and 100.5\u00c2\u00b0F (38\u00c2\u00b0C). You may also have the chills. If your appendix bursts, the resulting infection could cause your fever to rise.\n[17] Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection in the ovaries, uterus, or fallopian tubes. It is most often caused by sexually transmitted infections like gonorrhoea or chlamydia. It is one of the most common causes of pelvic pain in women.varian pain causes. Ovarian pain, affecting the area around the ovaries, may be caused by several different conditions affecting the lower abdomen below the tummy button. Pain in the ovaries can either be acute or chronic.\n[18] Occasionally, it is caused by a ruptured appendix, tuberculosis, or diverticulitis. It can involve the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes (which link the ovaries and uterus) (figure 1). Chronic changes following pelvic inflammatory disease occur in about one-third of women and causes chronic pelvic pain.\n[19] other potential causes of vaginal pain and lower pelvic pain can include vaginal dryness infections or other problems with the digestive system especially the bowels or the bladder strains sprains or weakness of the back fibromyalgia a chronic widespread pain syndrome\n[20] Many of these syndromes are caused by trauma (surgical, pregnancy or sports) and / or exercise-related injuries. The two most common nerve entrapment syndromes causing pelvic pain are piriformis syndrome and pudendal nerve entrapment. Lumbar plexus entrapment syndromes are not as common and thus will be briefly discussed.\nSearch Query: right pelvic pain causes.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Although pelvic pain often refers to pain in the region of women's internal reproductive organs, pelvic pain can be present in men, too, and can stem from multiple causes. Pelvic pain may be a symptom of infection or may arise from pain in the pelvic bone or in non-reproductive internal organs, such as the bladder or colon.\n[2] Thus, unexplained pelvic pain is often due to adhesions. These commonly form after a surgery, infection, endometriosis or trauma. Pelvic adhesions join structures with strong glue-like bonds that can last a lifetime and can cause chronic pelvic pain.\n[3] Chronic nonbacterial prostatitis, also known as chronic pelvic pain syndrome, is a common condition that affects men. It causes pain and inflammation in the prostate, pelvis, and the lower urinary tract. The prostate gland is located right below the bladder in men. It produces fluid that helps transport sperm.\n[4] Pelvic inflammatory disease is one of the most common causes of acute pelvic pain in women, and imaging findings vary with the stage of disease. Most cases result from ascending infection, usually caused by a mixture of anaerobic and aerobic organisms.\n[5] Some of the more common sources of acute pelvic pain, or pain that occurs very suddenly, may include: 1 ectopic pregnancy: a pregnancy that occurs outside the uterus. 2 pelvic inflammatory disease: an infection of the reproductive organs. 3 twisted or ruptured ovarian cyst. 4 miscarriage or threatened miscarriage.\n[6] Cause.

In some cases the pain comes from your pelvic bones that lie next to these organs, or from nearby muscles, nerves, blood vessels or joints. So, there are many causes of pelvic pain. Pelvic pain is more common in women than in men. This leaflet will deal with the most common causes of pelvic pain in women. Pelvic pain can be acute or chronic.\n[8] The following conditions often cause lower abdominal pain, sometimes described as pelvic pain: 1 Appendicitis. 2 Cystitis (bladder inflammation) 3 Diverticulitis. Problems with the cervix, such as a cervical infection, inflamed cervix or growths on the cervix.\n[9] Pelvic pain may be a symptom of infection or may arise from pain in the pelvic bone or in non-reproductive internal organs, such as the bladder or colon.\n[10] Pelvic pain (pain below the belly button in the anterior lower abdomen including the sex organs) may develop from many diseases and conditions. For example, pelvic pain may come from normal menstruation, appendicitis, bladder problems; and may be associated with both benign and emergency medical conditions.ressure and pain in the pelvic area, the urge to urinate, painful urination, and pain during intercourse also may occur. Although the cause of IC is unknown, there are medications to reduce the symptoms. Like uterine fibroids described previously, IC occurs mainly in women aged 30 to 40, and the cause is unknown.\n[11] The following conditions often cause lower right abdominal pain 1 : Appendicitis. 2 Cancer. 3 Cholecystitis (gallbladder inflammation). 4 Diverticulitis. 5 Problems with the cervix, such as a cervical infection, inflamed cervix or growths on the cervix. 6 Endometriosis. 7 Inguinal hernia. 8 Injury. 9 Intestinal obstruction.\n[12] The following conditions often cause lower right abdominal pain 1 : Appendicitis. 2 Cancer. 3 Cholecystitis (gallbladder inflammation). 4 Diverticulitis. 5 Problems with the cervix, such as a cervical infection, inflamed cervix or growths on the cervix. 6 Endometriosis. 7 Inguinal hernia. 8 Injury.\n[13] Pelvic pain can be a sign that there is a problem with one of the organs in your pelvic area, such as the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix or vagina. It could also be a symptom of infection, or a problem with the urinary tract, lower intestines, rectum, muscle or bone.\n[14] Female pelvic pain is typically caused by a medical condition involving the reproductive organs, urinary tract, lower gastrointestinal tract, or muscles of the abdominal wall.

Pelvic pain is more common in women than in men.\n[16] Pelvic pain is pain in the lowest part of your abdomen and pelvis. In women, pelvic pain may refer to symptoms arising from the reproductive or urinary systems or from musculoskeletal sources. Depending on its source, pelvic pain may be dull or sharp; it may be constant or off and on (intermittent); and it may be mild, moderate or severe. Pelvic pain can sometimes radiate to your lower back, buttocks or thighs. Pelvic pain can occur suddenly, sharply and briefly (acute) or over the long term (chronic). Chronic pelvic pain refers to any constant or intermittent pelvic pain that has been present for more than a few months. Sometimes, you may notice pelvic pain only at certain times, such as when you urinate or during sexual activity. 1 Causes.\n[17] Chronic pelvic pain is pain in the area below your bellybutton and between your hips that lasts six months or longer. Chronic pelvic pain can have multiple causes. It can be a symptom of another disease, or it can be a condition in its own right. If your chronic pelvic pain appears to be caused by another medical problem, treating that problem may be enough to eliminate your pain.\n[18] Adhesions and Chronic Pelvic Pain (CPP). ADHESIONS are believed to cause pelvic pain by tethering down organs and tissues, causing traction (pulling) of nerves. Nerve endings may become entrapped within a developing adhesion. If the bowel becomes obstructed, distention will cause pain. Some patients in whom chronic pelvic pain has lasted more than six months may develop Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome. In addition to the chronic pain, emotional and behavioral changes appear due to the duration of the pain and its associated stress.\n[19] Endometriosis may cause pelvic pain, especially during menstruation. Hormones of the menstrual cycle cause the endometriosis to bleed each month. This can be painful and result in the formation of pelvic adhesions, also known as scar tissue. Blood trapped in the ovary can build up into a cyst.\n[20] Endometriosis may cause pelvic pain, especially during menstruation.

Treating PID right away is important, because PID can cause scar tissue in the pelvic organs and lead to infertility. It can also cause other problems, such as pelvic pain and tubal (ectopic) pregnancy. PID is caused by bacteria entering the reproductive organs through the cervix. When the cervix is infected, bacteria from the vagina can more easily get into and infect the uterus and fallopian tubes. You're more likely to get PID if you: Have a sexually transmitted infection (STI).\n[3] Chronic pelvic pain has many possible causes, and the symptoms may vary with what's causing the pain. Endometriosis is a condition in which the lining of the uterus (endometrium) grows outside the uterus. The lining can attach to the ovaries, fallopian tubes, intestines or other structures in the pelvis. Adenomyosis occurs when tissue from the lining of the uterus grows in the muscle of the uterus. Endometriosis may cause pelvic pain, especially during menstruation. Hormones of the menstrual cycle cause the endometriosis to bleed each month. This can be painful and result in the formation of pelvic adhesions, also known as scar tissue. Blood trapped in the ovary can build up into a cyst.\n[4] Chronic pelvic pain can be intermittent or constant. Intermittent chronic pelvic pain usually has a specific cause, while constant pelvic pain may be the result of more than one problem. A common example of chronic pelvic pain is dysmenorrhea or menstrual cramps. Other causes of chronic pelvic pain include endometriosis, adenomyosis, and ovulation pain. Sometimes an illness starts with intermittent pelvic pain that becomes constant over time, this is often a signal that the problem has become worse.\n[5] Surgery is a major cause of pelvic pain, as the internal bonds which form after surgery bind delicate internal structures in powerful adhesive straight-jackets. Repeat surgery can help clear the adhesions, but the near-inevitable result is more adhesion formation as the body heals from the new surgery.\n[6] Any of these events can cause adhesions to form, which may later cause chronic pelvic pain. Infection and Inflammation. Bladder, vaginal and yeast infections, and inflammations from chlamydia, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or endometriosis may also cause chronic pelvic pain.

Often, doctors cannot identify a disorder.\n[20] Symptoms of pelvic pain can occur along with other symptoms, depending upon the exact cause. Associated symptoms can include low back pain, vaginal or urethral bleeding or discharge, fever, and pain during sex. Endometriosis is a common cause of pelvic pain in women that can cause heavy menstrual bleeding as well as pain during or after sex. The diagnosis of pelvic pain involves laboratory studies as well as imaging tests like ultrasound, CT, X-ray, or MRI.\nSearch Query: right pelvic pain causes.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Due to the close proximity of organs in the abdominal and pelvic cavity, it is not always possible to isolate a specific organ when pain occurs at a particular region. Therefore the most common conditions of the nearest organs to this area needs to be considered. Pain may arise from the hip joint itself or the pelvic bone but there are also other possible conditions as discussed below. Abdominal wall pain is one of the common but often neglected causes of right hip pain. The pain may arise with trauma to the abdominal wall or with muscle strain. The pain is typically superficial and aggravated with movement or touch.\n[3] Some of the possible common medical causes of Pelvic pain may include: 1 Pelvic abscess. 2 Ovarian cyst. 3 Ovarian cancer. 4 Endometriosis. 5 Sequelae of acute PID. 6 Chronis pancreatitis. 7 Renal calculi. 8 Inflammatory bowel disease. 9 Irritable bowel syndrome. 10 Microscopic colitis. 11 Left renal vein entrapment. 12 Muscular infection.\n[4] Causes of Pelvic pain.

With right lower back pain both the link between the Sacrum and the Pelvis is the most likely cause. The imbalances in the pelvis create tension on the Sacro-Iliac joint and hence pain occurs. To ease this pain and build strength ion the area you need to use technqiues that work well and quickly.\n[9] Other causes in women or men Examples of other possible causes of pelvic pain \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in women or men \u00e2\u0080\u0094 include: 1 Appendicitis. 2 Colon cancer. 3 Chronic constipation. 4 Crohn's disease. 5 Diverticulitis. 6 Fibromyalgia. 7 Inguinal hernia. 8 Interstitial cystitis (also called painful bladder syndrome).\n[10] Causes of Pelvic Pain.

The last part of the colon, which connects the descending colon to the rectum, is known as the sigmoid colon. All fecal matter is stored in this S-shaped part of the colon before it is expelled. When cancer cells are present in the lining of the sigmoid colon, it is termed as sigmoid colon cancer. Sigmoid colon cancer can be divided into three separate stages, depending on how far the cancer has spread.\n[19] Sigmoid volvulus is a condition that affects a person's bowel and causes intestinal obstruction. When someone has this condition, the ending part of the large bowel, called the sigmoid colon, twists abnormally and causes a blockage.\n[20] The sigmoid colon refers to the lower portion of the colon. In people who have diverticulitis, the sigmoid colon walls will develop pouches which trap food.

Usually, though, sigmoid is used in contexts relating to the sigmoid colon-the contracted and crooked part of the colon immediately above the rectum. Sigmoid comes from sigma, the name of the 18th letter of the Greek alphabet.

The shape sense of sigmoid is most often used in scientific contexts to describe an s-shaped curve on a graph. Usually, though, sigmoid is used in contexts relating to the sigmoid colon-the contracted and crooked part of the colon immediately above the rectum. Sigmoid comes from sigma, the name of the 18th letter of the Greek alphabet.\n[11] The header of the SIGMET message contains the type of the message, issuing country or territory, bulletin. number, creator of the message (generally the FIR where the observation/forecast is in) and the date/time. of the dissemination of the message.\n[12] The criteria for a non-convective SIGMET to be issued are severe or greater turbulence over a 3,000-square-mile (7,800 km2) area, or severe or greater icing over a 3,000-square-mile (7,800 km2) area or IMC conditions over a 3,000-square-mile (7,800 km2) area due to dust, sand, or volcanic ash [1].\n[13] Definition of AIRMET. plural.

Sigmoid colon, a terminal section of the large intestine that connects the descending colon to the rectum; its function is to store fecal wastes until they are ready to leave the body. The sigmoid colon derives its name from the fact that it is curved in the form of an S (Greek sigma: \u00cf\u0083).\n[18] The sigmoid colon is the part of the large intestine after the descending colon and before the rectum. The name sigmoid means S-shaped (see sigmoid; cf. sigmoid sinus). The walls of the sigmoid colon are muscular, and contract to increase the pressure inside the colon, causing the stool to move into the rectum.\n[19] See Article History. Sigmoid colon, a terminal section of the large intestine that connects the descending colon to the rectum; its function is to store fecal wastes until they are ready to leave the body. The sigmoid colon derives its name from the fact that it is curved in the form of an S (Greek sigma: \u00cf\u0083). Its size depends upon the amount of waste material in it, but when contracted its diameter is only about one inch (2.5 centimetres). The internal surface of the sigmoid colon is similar to that of the rest of the large intestine. The smooth mucous membrane lining secretes mucus and enzymes, and the lining\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surface cells can absorb fluids. Most of these activities occur, however, higher up in the intestinal tract.\n[20] The sigmoid colon (pelvic colon) is the part of the large intestine that is closest to the rectum and anus. It forms a loop that averages about 40 cm in length, and normally lies within the pelvis, but on account of its freedom of movement it is liable to be displaced into the abdominal cavity.\nSearch Query: definition of a sigmet.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Sharks have adapted to living in a wide range of aquatic habitats at various temperatures. While some species inhabit shallow, coastal regions, others live in deep waters, on the ocean floor and in the open ocean.\n[3] Tiger Shark Habits and Habitat. The tiger shark loves warm waters and is found in most tropical and temperate regions. Other than a ready supply of food, tiger sharks don't have a lot of other requirements for their abode.\n[4] Warm-blooded means that at rest, the animal keeps its body warm and above the temperature of its surroundings. Cold-blooded means that at rest, the animals body temperature \u00e2\u0080\u00a6is the same as that of its surroundings. Cold-blooded animals have to warm themselves up (usually by sunning them selves or by vibrating their muscles) before they become active while warmblooded animals are already warm and ready for action. Also warmblooded animals can operate at temperatures where cold-blooded animals can not (eg polar bears). -------------------------------------------------------------- Warm Blooded try to keep the inside of their bodies at a constant temperature.\n[5] Two examples are lizards basking in the sun to warm up, and fish in a lake moving up and down the water column to find a preferred temperature.. Davison said mammals and birds were endotherms (warm blooded), with a high, constant, core temperature fuelled by internal heat sources.\n[6] Warm blooded animals, like mammals and birds, need a lot of fuel and use that energy to their advantage, including faster movement and boosted brain power. In burning all that food they also maintain a high, stable body temperature. They've taken real, empirical data from living animals and come up with a model.\n[7] Being warm-blooded gives mammals a distinct advantage in may habitats, allowing them to be active when reptiles are hardly able to move. It also allows mammals to live in habitats where reptiles cannot live at all, such as the arctic, mountain tops, etc.\n[8] What are some warm-blooded animals? A: A list of warm-blooded animals would include all mammals and birds (with very few exceptions), such as apes, monkeys, whales, elephants, cheetahs, giraffes, dogs, cats, pigs and humans. All reptiles, amphibians, fish and insects are considered cold-blooded. Continue Reading.\n[9] Whale sharks live in warm waters and tropical oceans around the world. It is restricted to around +- 30 degrees of latitude.hale sharks live in warm waters and tropical oceans around the world. It is restricted to around +- 30 degrees of latitude.\n[10] This is because in warm-blooded animals, the heat they lose is proportional to the surface area of their bodies, while the heat they produce is proportional to their mass. This means that larger warm-blooded animals can generate more heat than they lose and they can keep their body temperatures stable more easily.\n[11] Reptiles and fish are cold-blooded animals, they get their heat from the environment. All mammals are warm-blooded, and humans are mammals. Warm-blooded species make their own body heat and can maintain a body temperature higher than their environment. Warm-blooded animals \u00e2\u0080\u0094 mammals and birds \u00e2\u0080\u0094 have body temperatures that usually stay roughly the same, even in cold temperatures.\n[12] Examples of shallow water sharks are the nurse, the hammerhead, the sandbar, the great white and the tiger shark. Pelagic sharks are shortfin makos and whale sharks. Deep water sharks, such as catsharks, goblin sharks and megamouth sharks, stay in cold water all year round.lthough large temperate sharks will travel into tropical waters, they will swim only at depths where the temperature is in their preferred range. Smaller sharks are much more affected by heat and cold and stay within their limits. Sandbar sharks like water temperature between about 15\u00c2\u00b0-30\u00c2\u00b0C (59&deg-86&degF).\n[13] Skin: Whales have smooth skin, while fish have scales. Body heat: Whales are warm-blooded (endothermic), while fish are cold-blooded (ectothermic). Whales have blubber, a layer of fat, that helps to keep them warm, and they also generate heat by swimming and by digesting food.\n[14] bottom-dweller - a fish that lives and feeds on the bottom of a body of water. bottom-feeder. fish - any of various mostly cold-blooded aquatic vertebrates usually having scales and breathing through gills; the shark is a large fish; in the living room there was a tank of colorful fish. mullet - bottom dwelling marine warm water fishes with two barbels on the chin.\n[15] There are over 470 species of shark swimming in Earth's oceans, but we tend to focus most of our attention on about five of them. Here's some of the coolest, lesser known sjarks we've heard of. 1. Megamouth shark. Image caption: Megamouth shark by OpenCage via Wikimedia Commons. Licensed by CC.\n[16] Sharks: Body Parts. If you look at a shark, you will see it has a number of special adaptations that allow it to fit into an ocean environment. A shark has fins and a streamlined body that help it swim through water.It has gills, which take in oxygen directly out of the water.Because of its gills, sharks can stay underwater and not have to come to the surface to breathe. shark has fins and a streamlined body that help it swim through water.

Because of its gills, sharks can stay underwater and not have to come to the surface to breathe.\n[17] Many hammerhead sharks live in warm waters fairly close to shore, although most of them are not considered of much danger to humans. Here you can learn about the 10 species of hammerhead sharks, which range in size from about 3 feet to 20 feet in length.\n[18] 1/6. 1 In Gansbaai, the largest white shark ever caught was at Danger Point and measured up to 5.9m. 2 If you see a white shark in the water don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t panic. 3 White sharks have a unique system called a \u00e2\u0080\u009ccounter current heat exchange\u00e2\u0080\u009d, which keeps their body tempreture +/- 7C above the surrounding water temperature.\n[19] What eats a shark? What do sharks eat? There are many species of sharks, from tiny, two-foot (.75 meter) sand sharks to great white sharks that can reach a length of 20 feet (6.5 meters) or more. Most sharks eat fish, octopi, squid, turtles, and other cold-blooded sea creatures, along with the occasional sea bird caught napping on the water.\n[20] Mammals and birds are warm-blooded, which means that they can make their own body heat even when it is cold outside. Whether it is sunny and hot outside or there is a snowstorm and it is very cold, warm-blooded animals have body temperatures that usually stay the same.\nSearch Query: how are some sharks warm blooded.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

It also allows mammals to live in habitats where reptiles cannot live at all, such as the arctic, mountain tops, etc.\n[8] In hot conditions, many warm-blooded animals increase heat loss by panting, which cools the animal by increasing water evaporation in the breath, and/or flushing, increasing the blood flow to the skin so the heat will radiate into the environment.\n[9] The bull shark, also known as the Zambezi shark in Africa, and Lake Nicaragua shark in Nicaragua, is a requiem shark commonly found worldwide in warm, shallow waters along coasts and in rivers. The bull shark is known for its aggressive nature, predilection for warm shallow water, and presence in brackish and freshwater systems including estuaries and rivers. Bull sharks can thrive in both salt and fresh water and can travel far up rivers. They have been known to travel up the Mississippi River as far as Alton, Illinois, although few freshwater human-shark interactions have been recorded.\n[10] In this way, a fish is something like a blimp or hot air balloon that uses the upward lift of atmospheric buoyancy to change altitude. A shark is more like an airplane. It doesn't have a swim bladder, so it uses its forward movement to control vertical position. The tail is like the shark's propeller -- the shark swings it back and forth to move forward. In an airplane, this forward movement pushes air around the wings.\n[11] Warm-blooded means that at rest, the animal keeps its body warm and above the temperature of its surroundings.

This is a tropical and subtropical fish.\n[8] The Dall's Porpoise \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a chunky, hyperactive speed demon of the North Pacific \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is believed to be even faster (speeds up to 34.5 mph have been reported), but since it does not fare well in captivity, it has not been trained or its speed measured. Most large sharks are cold-blooded and cruise at a leisurely 1.5 mph.\n[9] Shark. member of a group of almost exclusively marine and predaceous fishes. There are about 250 species of sharks, ranging from the 2-ft (60-cm) pygmy shark to 50-ft (15-m) giants.

Two of the exceptions are the tuna and the Pacific salmon shark, which can raise their body temperature to some degree. Some fish have scales.\n[5] Although large temperate sharks will travel into tropical waters, they will swim only at depths where the temperature is in their preferred range. Smaller sharks are much more affected by heat and cold and stay within their limits. Sandbar sharks like water temperature between about 15\u00c2\u00b0-30\u00c2\u00b0C (59&deg-86&degF).\n[6] The Great White Shark, mostly lives in warm water known as tropical water but also the Hammerhead shark lives in those kinds of water too ^_^ hope this helped.\n[7] Basking Shark. The Basking Shark is the second largest or biggest shark. It is found in temperate and warm oceans of the world. The behavior of Basking shark toward human divers is friendly and they never attack on human divers. It feeds on zoo plankton and on small fishes.\n[8] The whale shark inhabits all tropical and warm-temperate seas. The fish is primarily pelagic, living in the open sea but not in the greater depths of the ocean, although it is known to occasionally dive to depths of as much as 1,800 metres (5,900 ft).\n[9] 1 Fish live in water. 2 Fish have a backbone. 3 They are vertebrates. 4 Fish breathe using gills. 5 They absorb oxygen through the gills. 6 Almost all fish are cold-blooded. 7 Two of the exceptions are the tuna and the Pacific salmon shark, which can raise their body temperature to some degree.

Warm-blooded creatures, like mammals and birds, try to keep the inside of their bodies at a constant temperature. They do this by generating their own heat when they are in a cooler environment, and by cooling themselves when they are in a hotter environment.\n[11] According to an article in the journal Science, the opah is a rarity: A warm-blooded fish that can swim fast by flapping its fins like water wings as it speeds through the water.

The other is ocean depth temperature, which is categorized as shallow, deep or open ocean waters. Sharks can be classified as polar, temperate, or tropical, depending on the surface temperature of the ocean region they inhabit.These temperature regions can be imagined as wide bands drawn over the ocean's surface, showing the range of water temperature within them.lthough large temperate sharks will travel into tropical waters, they will swim only at depths where the temperature is in their preferred range. Smaller sharks are much more affected by heat and cold and stay within their limits.

Seals find a nice beach and give birth to their pups there.ut whales, dolphins and otters (I'm supposing it's sea otters you're talking about) give birth in water. Although their babies are born in water and can swim, they need adults to help them to the surface to breathe. As for sharks, most lay eggs, but some do give live birth.\n[2] Confidence votes 30. It depends on the type of shark, most sharks like living in warm or tropical waters,such as Hawaii and Australia.Some sharks though can live in colder waters,such as the Greenland shark and the Great White shark.The Great White Shark has even been seen in the cold waters of Sanfransisco.\n[3] Blubber helps these marine mammals from getting too cold. (Cold-blooded marine animals, such as fish, sharks or crabs, do not need to stay warm and can let their body temperatures get closer to that of the water. Thus, they do not need to have this extra insulation.) Blubber is a thick layer of fat (adipose) tissue.Animals store extra digested food in the form of adipose tissue, which contains molecules called lipids.hus, they do not need to have this extra insulation.)

These are small pores filled with a gel that transmits the electrical currents in the water to the shark\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brain so that it can assess its environment.\n[7] \u00e2\u0080\u009cwarm-blooded\u00e2\u0080\u009d describes a mammal, or animal that generates its own body heat internally. For example birds and mammals (including humans) are warm-blooded animals. Reptiles and fish are cold-blooded animals, they get their heat from the environment. All mammals are warm-blooded, and humans are mammals. Warm-blooded species make their own body heat and can maintain a body temperature higher than their environment. Warm-blooded animals \u00e2\u0080\u0094 mammals and birds \u00e2\u0080\u0094 have body temperatures that usually stay roughly the same, even in cold temperatures.\n[8] Tropical Region: Hot tropical waters range from approximately 21\u00c2\u00b0 C (69.8&deg F) on up. The largest numbers of species and the largest populations of sharks live in the tropical region where the water temperature stays consistently warm.\n[9] Whale sharks are found in all tropical and warm-temperate seas around the world, preferring water temperatures of 20-25\u00c2\u00b0C. Whale sharks eat mostly small organisms like plankton, schooling fish, and squid, which they strain from the water as they swim with their meter-long mouths and specialized teeth.\n[10] But the advantages of endothermy are costly. To maintain a warm body in cold water, a mackerel shark must burn fuel like a blast furnace. A warm-bodied shark may need more than ten times as much food as a cold-bodied shark of the same size.\n[11] According to an article in the journal Science, the opah is a rarity: A warm-blooded fish that can swim fast by flapping its fins like water wings as it speeds through the water. The movement speeds the opah's metabolism and heats its blood, leading to better reaction times, according to researchers.\n[12] Large sharks that living in temperate waters include the great white shark, the shortfin mako shark, and the basking shark. These large temperate sharks can generate their own body heat and are therefore able to travel farther than smaller temperate sharks, which cannot.lthough large temperate sharks will travel into tropical waters, they will swim only at depths where the temperature is in their preferred range. Smaller sharks are much more affected by heat and cold and stay within their limits. Sandbar sharks like water temperature between about 15\u00c2\u00b0-30\u00c2\u00b0C (59&deg-86&degF).\n[13] That makes them a favorite of great whites. A high fat diet is mandatory for the great white to maintain its body temperature and keep its brain warm in cold water. Still, sharks do attack people along U.S. coasts and around the world, even if the nature and number of encounters belie expectations.\n[14] Whale sharks are found in all tropical and warm-temperate seas around the world, preferring water temperatures of. . Whale sharks eat mostly small organisms like plankton, schooling fish, and squid, which they strain from the water as they swim with their meter-long mouths and specialized teeth.\n[15] Skin: Whales have smooth skin, while fish have scales. Body heat: Whales are warm-blooded (endothermic), while fish are cold-blooded (ectothermic). Whales have blubber, a layer of fat, that helps to keep them warm, and they also generate heat by swimming and by digesting food.\n[16] Different species of sharks are found all around the world but mainly in warmer water.

Some species live mainly in cold waters, while some others prefer warmer waters. SHARK MIGRATION. One thing is for sure; sharks migrate to find new sources of food and they can travel up to hundreds of miles to do that. Most species of sharks live in the oceans. However, some of them are known to dwell in bodies of freshwater, like the bull shark which travels up to 4,000 Km up the Amazon River. Sometimes, sharks reach freshwater bodies; this could be the result of the destruction of their habitat by human activities.\n[2] A question came across SHARK-L concerning makos being considered warm-blooded and various replies touch upon aspects of the topic. There are currently two species of mako recognized, the Longfin (Isurus paucus) and the Shortfin (I. oxyrinchus).\n[3] Certain lamnid sharks, tuna and billfishes are also endothermic. In common parlance, endotherms are characterized as warm-blooded .. The opposite of endothermy is ectothermy, although there is no absolute or clear separation between the nature of endotherms and ectotherms in general.\n[4] White sharks are part of the fish family, so they must be 'cold-blooded', right? Actually, white sharks are much more complex than you may think. An animal that is 'cold-blooded' means their inside body temperature is dependent on the environment they are in. For example, a snake is cold blooded, so its body temperature fluctuates with the day or even whether or not they are in the sun.\n[5] These sharks are unique in their ability to elevate and maintain body temperatures as much as 13 C above the ambient water temperature. One striking feature of these warm-bodied sharks is that their flanks and viscera are warm, while the heart and gills are at environmental temperatures.\n[6] The Salmon Shark is one of the warmest of the warm-bodied sharks. Measurements of its epaxial (upper back) muscles indicate that this species is able to maintain a body temperature 14 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit (8 to 11 degrees Celsius) above the ambient water temperature.\n[7] The Largest Great White Sharks. Great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) are huge and powerful warm-blooded fish that have been around for at least 11 million years. Also known as white pointers, their ancestors existed on Earth 400 million years ago, which is 200 million years before the first dinosaur appeared.\n[8] Meet the Comical Opah, the Only Truly Warm-Blooded Fish.

Tuna, sharks, and swordfish are fast-moving predators and accordingly, their bodies look like streamlined torpedoes. By contrast, the opah looks like a big startled frisbee, with thin red fins stuck on as an afterthought.\n[9] Most large sharks are cold-blooded and cruise at a leisurely 1.5 mph. Because most species fare poorly in captivity, the maximum swimming speed of a shark has seldom been measured. The Blue Shark is an open ocean glider, planing on wing-like pectoral fins and flattened belly.\n[10] They could be either predators (e.g. Killer whale) or filter feeders.

Several species of shark and tuna have something special going on inside their bodies. For a long time, scientists have known that some fish species appear warm-blooded. Salmon sharks can elevate their body temperatures by up to 20 degrees compared to the surrounding water, for example.\n[2] Most sharks are cold-blooded. Some, like the Mako and the Great white shark, are partially warmblooded (they are endotherms). Cold blooded although if you've ever seen a Great White Shark hunt sea lions you'd be thinking they would have to be hotblooded. Actually the Salmon Shark is a warm blooded shark.\n[3] Most sharks are cold-blooded. Some, like the Mako and the Great white shark, are partially warmblooded (they are endotherms).

Sharks are by no means evil, vicious killers like that quote suggests. Nonetheless, sharks are, for the most part anyways, efficient ectothermic predators. Endo vs Ecto.\n[10] For many people, sharks are the epitome of the 'cold-blooded killer'. The warm-bodied mackerel sharks are spectacular reminders that many of our stereotypes are inaccurate. As apex predators, sharks are absolutely essential to the health and vigor of marine ecosystems.\n[11] These sharks are unique in their ability to elevate and maintain body temperatures as much as 13 C above the ambient water temperature.

The mid segment theorem states that a segment that connects the mid points of any two sides is parallel to the third side and also its measure is half the measure of the third side. That is, DE ll AB and DE = $\\frac{1}{2}$ AB. Therefore, CA = CD + DA = 2 CD.\n[2] The formula for the area of a trapezoid is A = (1/2)(h)(a + b), where: 1 h = height (This is the perpendicular height, not the length of the legs.) 2 a = the short base. 3 b = the long base.\n[3] To calculate the area of trapezoids, take the average of bases and multiply by its height. The area of a trapezoid is given by: A = (a + b) \u00e2\u0088\u0099 h /2 a: the length of the top b: the length of the base h: the height When a = 0 the shape becomes a triangle. Example 1: What is the area of a trapezoid having bases 5cm and 8cm and a height of 6cm? Solution:\n[4] trapezoid, closed plane figure bounded by four line segments, or sides, two of which are parallel and two of which are nonparallel. The parallel sides of a trapezoid are called bases and the nonparallel sides legs; in an isosceles trapezoid the legs are of equal length. The median of a trapezoid is the line segment connecting the midpoints of the legs; it is parallel to the bases and equal to half the sum of their lengths.\n[5] For various classes of functions that are not twice-differentiable, the trapezoidal rule has sharper bounds than Simpson's rule. Applicability and alternatives. The trapezoidal rule is one of a family of formulas for numerical integration called Newton\u00e2\u0080\u0093Cotes formulas, of which the midpoint rule is similar to the trapezoid rule. Simpson's rule is another member of the same family, and in general has faster convergence than the trapezoidal rule for functions which are twice continuously differentiable, though not in all specific cases.\n[6] The median of a trapezoid is a segment parallel to the bases that connects the midpoints of the non-parallel sides. This line is special because we can determine its length directly from the length of the two bases. No joke.\n[7] Add the four sides of the trapezoid together. Following the equation, you need to add the four sides of the trapezoid together in order to find the perimeter. This will give you your final answer. 1 Example: A trapezoid has a 3-cm base, 2-cm top, and two 1-cm slanted sides.\n[8] To find the area of a trapezoid: Multiply half the sum of the two parallel sides by the distance between them. Getting Gold J. C. F. Johnson The second trapezoid is composed of pieces which can be placed in the rectangle, filling it completely.\n[9] In order to find the area of an isoceles trapezoid, you must average the bases and multiply by the height. The average of the bases is straight forward: In order to find the height, you must draw an altitude. This creates a right triangle in which one of the legs is also the height of the trapezoid.here is the length of the side opposite the. Beginning with the side, if we were to create a triangle, the length of the base is, and the height is. Creating another triangle on the left, we find the height is, the length of the base is, and the side is.

A trapezoid is a quadrilateral -- a four sided shape -- with two parallel sides, called bases, of unequal length. You can find the area of a trapezoid using the lengths of these two sides, and the distance between the two sides, called the height.If you don't know a trapezoid's height, solve for it using the Pythagorean Theorem and length of the trapezoid's diagonals, the two sides that connect its bases.rea, A, is given by the lengths of the two bases, b1 and b2, divided by 2 and multiplied by the trapezoid's height, h, as follows: A = (b1 + b2) / 2 x h. Take a trapezoid whose bases are 4 and 6 inches long and which is 2 inches high.\n[9] The formula for the area of a trapezoid is: Area = (1/2) * (a + b) * h, where a =base 1, b = base 2, and h = vertical height.

It is parallel to the bases. Its length m is equal to the average of the lengths of the bases a and b of the trapezoid,n obtuse trapezoid with two pairs of parallel sides is a parallelogram. A parallelogram has central 2-fold rotational symmetry (or point reflection symmetry). There is some disagreement whether parallelograms, which have two pairs of parallel sides, should be regarded as trapezoids.\n[2] Extended Conjecture: (Trapezoid Midsegment Conjecture): The midsegment of a trapezoid is parallel to the bases and is equal in length to the average of the lengths of the two bases. Explanation: A midsegment of a trapezoid is a segment that connects the midpoints of the two non-parallel sides of a trapezoid. This segment has two special properties. It is parallel to the bases of the trapezoid. The length of the midsegment is the average of the lengths of the two bases. Remember that the bases of a trapezoid are parallel. Key Curriculum Press can provide demo versions of Geometer's Sketch Pad.\n[3] The midsegment of a trapezoid has two special properties: 1 The midsegment of a trapezoid is parallel to each base. 2 The length of the midsegment of a trapezoid is equal to half the sum of the lengths of its bases.\n[4] The side of the triangle that the midsegment does not intersect is the base of the triangle. The midsegment of a trapezoid is the segment formed by connecting the midpoints of the two legs of a trapezoid. Although the midsegment of a trapezoid is also useful in mathematics, we will not discuss it here.\n[5] The segment that connects the midpoints of the legs of a trapezoid is called the midsegment. This segment's length is always equal to one-half the sum of the trapezoid's bases, or. Consider trapezoid ABCD shown below.\n[6] The top and bottom sides of the trapezoid run parallel to each other, so they are the trapezoid's bases. The other sides of the trapezoid will intersect if extended, so they are the trapezoid's legs. The segment that connects the midpoints of the legs of a trapezoid is called the midsegment.\n[7] According to this theorem mid segment of a trapezoid is equal to half of sum of its two parallel sides. In triangle ABC M is mid point of AB and P is midpoint of AC. so MP is mid segment of triangle ABC. similarly just apply this rule in triangle ACD the PN is midsegment of triangle ACD.\n[8] This segment's length is always equal to one-half the sum of the trapezoid's bases, or. Consider trapezoid ABCD shown below. The midsegment, EF, which is shown in red, has a length of. The measurement of the midsegment is only dependent on the length of the trapezoid's bases.\n[9] The opposite sides of a trapezoid that are parallel to each other are called bases. The remaining sides of the trapezoid, which intersect at some point if extended, are called the legs of the trapezoid. The top and bottom sides of the trapezoid run parallel to each other, so they are the trapezoid's bases. The other sides of the trapezoid will intersect if extended, so they are the trapezoid's legs. The segment that connects the midpoints of the legs of a trapezoid is called the midsegment.\n[10] In a regular n-gon, the sum of the measures of the exterior angles is ___. The sum of the measures of the exterior angles of a 39-gon is ___. If the midsegment of a trapezoid has length 8 m, and one of the bases has length 6 cm, then the other base has length ___cm.\n[11] A line segment which joins mid points of two leg of trapezoid is called midline or mid segment. Theorem: According to this theorem mid segment of a trapezoid is equal to half of sum of its two parallel sides. Proof of theorem: Proof: let P is middle point of line segment AC. In triangle ABC M is mid point of AB and P is midpoint of AC. so MP is mid segment of triangle ABC.\n[12] The midsegment of a triangle is defined as the segment formed by connecting the midpoints of any two sides of a triangle. 2) It is parallel to the base. 3) It forms a smaller triangle that has all the same angle measures as the original triangle.\n[13] Midsegment Theorem Proof. The mid segment theorem states that a segment that connects the mid points of any two sides is parallel to the third side and also its measure is half the measure of the third side. That is, DE ll AB and DE = $\\frac{1}{2}$ AB. Therefore, CA = CD + DA = 2 CD.\n[14] The segment EF, joining midpoints E and F of the lateral sides, is called a midline of a trapezoid. A midline of a trapezoid is equal to a half-sum of bases: and parallel to them: EF || AD and EF || BC. A trapezoid with equal lateral sides ( AB = CD ) is called an isoscelestrapezoid. In an isosceles trapezoid angles by each base, are equal ( A = D, B = C ). A parallelogram can be considered as a particular case of trapezoid. Midline of a triangle is a segment, joining midpoints of lateral sides of a triangle.\n[15] The median of a trapezoid is a segment parallel to the bases that connects the midpoints of the non-parallel sides.

The length of the midsegment is the sum of the two bases divided by 2. Remember that the bases of a trapezoid are the two parallel sides. To find angles within a trapezoid, remember that since there are two sides are parallel, the other sides can be seen as transversals, forming corresponding angles and same side interior angles.\n[4] The midsegment of a trapezoid is referred to as the median or the midline. The length of the midsegment is calculated by finding the average length of each of the parallel sides. The formula for this length is the sum of the length of side A plus the length of side B, divided by two. The midsegment is also used to calculate the area of a trapezoid. Learn more about Shapes.\n[5] The midpoint of the red segment pictured on the left is the point (A, 2b). The most important thing to remember is that a midpoint bisects a line (cuts a line into two equal halves). The midsegment of a trapezoid is the segment that joins the midpoints of the nonparallel sides of a trapezoid. In the trapezoid below, the midpoints of the non-parallel sides are points S and V.

It is parallel to the bases. Its length m is equal to the average of the lengths of the bases a and b of the trapezoid, The midsegment of a trapezoid is one of the two bimedians (the other bimedian divides the trapezoid into equal areas). The height (or altitude) is the perpendicular distance between the bases.\n[9] The midsegment (also called the median or midline) of a trapezoid is the segment that joins the midpoints of the legs. It is parallel to the bases. Its length m is equal to the average of the lengths of the bases a and b of the trapezoid,\n[10] Median of a Trapezoid The median (also called a midline or midsegment) is a line segment half-way between the two bases. The median's length is the average of the two base lengths: m = a+b2\n[11] Extended Conjecture: (Trapezoid Midsegment Conjecture): The midsegment of a trapezoid is parallel to the bases and is equal in length to the average of the lengths of the two bases. Explanation: A midsegment of a trapezoid is a segment that connects the midpoints of the two non-parallel sides of a trapezoid. This segment has two special properties. It is parallel to the bases of the trapezoid. The length of the midsegment is the average of the lengths of the two bases. Remember that the bases of a trapezoid are parallel. Key Curriculum Press can provide demo versions of Geometer's Sketch Pad.\n[12] The midsegment of a trapezoid has two special properties: 1 The midsegment of a trapezoid is parallel to each base. 2 The length of the midsegment of a trapezoid is equal to half the sum of the lengths of its bases.\n[13] The segment that connects the midpoints of the legs of a trapezoid is called the midsegment. This segment's length is always equal to one-half the sum of the trapezoid's bases, or. Consider trapezoid ABCD shown below.\n[14] The top and bottom sides of the trapezoid run parallel to each other, so they are the trapezoid's bases. The other sides of the trapezoid will intersect if extended, so they are the trapezoid's legs. The segment that connects the midpoints of the legs of a trapezoid is called the midsegment.\n[15] The opposite sides of a trapezoid that are parallel to each other are called bases. The remaining sides of the trapezoid, which intersect at some point if extended, are called the legs of the trapezoid. The top and bottom sides of the trapezoid run parallel to each other, so they are the trapezoid's bases. The other sides of the trapezoid will intersect if extended, so they are the trapezoid's legs. The segment that connects the midpoints of the legs of a trapezoid is called the midsegment.\n[16] A line segment which joins mid points of two leg of trapezoid is called midline or mid segment. Theorem: According to this theorem mid segment of a trapezoid is equal to half of sum of its two parallel sides. Proof of theorem: Proof: let P is middle point of line segment AC. In triangle ABC M is mid point of AB and P is midpoint of AC. so MP is mid segment of triangle ABC.\n[17] The midsegment of a triangle is defined as the segment formed by connecting the midpoints of any two sides of a triangle. 2) It is parallel to the base. 3) It forms a smaller triangle that has all the same angle measures as the original triangle.\n[18] Midsegment Theorem Proof. The mid segment theorem states that a segment that connects the mid points of any two sides is parallel to the third side and also its measure is half the measure of the third side. That is, DE ll AB and DE = $\\frac{1}{2}$ AB. Therefore, CA = CD + DA = 2 CD.\n[19] The segment EF, joining midpoints E and F of the lateral sides, is called a midline of a trapezoid. A midline of a trapezoid is equal to a half-sum of bases: and parallel to them: EF || AD and EF || BC. A trapezoid with equal lateral sides ( AB = CD ) is called an isoscelestrapezoid. In an isosceles trapezoid angles by each base, are equal ( A = D, B = C ). A parallelogram can be considered as a particular case of trapezoid. Midline of a triangle is a segment, joining midpoints of lateral sides of a triangle.\n[20] The median of a trapezoid is a segment parallel to the bases that connects the midpoints of the non-parallel sides. This line is special because we can determine its length directly from the length of the two bases.

Getting your BSN isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just something you do for yourself, though. It also benefits your patients. Studies have shown that BSNs have lower patient mortality rates and lower failure to rescue rates.\n[12] Traditional vs. Accelerated BSN. A bachelor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in nursing (BSN) is typically favored and sometimes required for practice as an RN in the areas of case management, military, K-12 schools, certain clinical specialties and travel nursing or working abroad.\n[13] To recap, a traditional BSN program takes four years to complete, while an RN-to-BSN program may be more accelerated at 12-18 months. Graduates can become registered nurses after passing the national exam, and they can expect positive job growth in the field.\n[14] BSN degree nurses are better prepared to meet patient needs. The main difference in study between an ADN and BSN is the emphasis on additional education in leadership and management, wellness, and community nursing.\n[15] A Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) is a 4-year, undergraduate degree program that offers students a comprehensive nursing education and prepares them to take the RN certifying exam. Courses are offered on a number of specialized topics, including pediatric nursing and ethics in professional nursing.\n[16] A BSN, which stands for Bachelor of Science in Nursing, is a 4-year degree for students who usually don't have any prior nursing experience. Registered nurses (RNs) or licensed practical nurses (LPNs) wanting to earn a bachelor's degree may enroll in an RN-to-BSN degree completion program or an LPN-to-BSN degree completion program, respectively.\n[17] RN to BSN Majors Guide. The RN (Registered Nurse) to BSN (Bachelor of Science in Nursing) degree is designed for registered nurses who wish to obtain a bachelor's degree in nursing. The typical student in an RN to BSN program is a registered nurse employed full or part-time.\n[18] The advantage of the BSN is that more job opportunities in the future are available, just as in reasearch, teaching, management, public health, etc. But the ASN and the BSN RNs start off pretty much doing the same thing. Many people like myself get the ASN and then do a RN to BSN bridge.\n[19] Both ADN-prepared and BSN-prepared nurses can care for patients and perform traditional duties such as assessments, completion of procedures within the scope of practice, and medical charting. But an RN without a bachelor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s degree may not qualify for some nursing jobs that require additional education.\n[20] About a bachelor's degree in nursing.

Both degrees lead to getting your RN but there are some differences between the two.The main difference is the length of time and the amount of credits required to complete the program.enerally speaking, the starting rate is the same for an ADN or a BSN prepared nurse, but because many advanced positions require a BSN, the BSN prepared nurse does have the potential to earn more money. In 2006 the state of California conducted a survey of registered nurses.\n[20] About a bachelor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s degree in nursing. A bachelor of science in nursing (BSN) degree prepares you for a job as a registered nurse.

A registered nurse (RN) is a nurse who has passed the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX-RN) after completing an accredited training program. These programs come in the form of an Associate of Science in Nursing (ASN) or a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN).\n[2] Difference Between Rn and Bsn. RN vs BSN. RN is a Registered Nurse, and is a health care specialist who uses her learned nursing practices and processes to take care of an ailing person. A Registered Nurse is trained and qualified to treat patients. The Associate degree is two years, but on the other hand, the Bachelors degree takes four years.\n[3] Cancel. The difference between an RN and a BSN is that an RN is a title for a registered nurse, while a BSN stands for a Bachelor of Science in nursing. Learn about the differences between degrees and licenses with help from a licensed RN in this free video on nursing jobs and health care.\n[4] RN vs BSN. RN is a Registered Nurse, and is a health care specialist who uses her learned nursing practices and processes to take care of an ailing person. A Registered Nurse is trained and qualified to treat patients. The Associate degree is two years, but on the other hand, the Bachelors degree takes four years.\n[5] The BSN trains nurses for a professional role, along with the coursework in nursing science, leadership, research and nursing informatics. Summary: RN is a Registered Nurse, while BSN is a graduate program in nursing.\n[6] So first of all, you should know RN stands for Registered Nurse. And BSN stands for Bachelors of Science and Nursing. So right off the by, you see there's a difference. The BSN is a degree that you get in a university. It's usually a four year degree. And from there, you can take a state regulated test or the NCLEX.\n[7] No, RN is a professional license. BSN and ADN are college degrees. An ADN is an ASN or AAS degree obtained from a community college after two to three years of school (including prerequisites). A BSN is obtained from a four year university after four to six years of school (including prerequisites).\n[8] RN vs BSN: Whats the Difference? The RN vs BSN is a common debate. Both allow you to work as a registered nurse, but what is the benefit and difference of getting a BSN versus RN. RN (registered nurse) is a qualification or a job title. You become an RN by taking and passing the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX-RN). That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only way to become a registered nurse in the US.\n[9] Short version: All BSNs are RNs, but not all RNs are BSNs. RN is registered nurse. You can get there via a diploma program, an associates degree (ADN) program or a bachelors degree (BSN) program. A BSN RN is just an RN with a bachelor's degree--basically, they have the most schooling and it (usually) takes the longest to achieve.\n[10] BSN (Bachelor of Science Degree in Nursing) A BSN is not technically a different nursing position, but rather a higher-level degree leading to a position as an RN. While you can become a licensed RN after successfully passing NCLEX, you can only earn a BSN at an accredited college or university.\n[11] BSN stands for Bachelor of Science in nursing whereas RN stands for registered nurse. There are currently two types of registered nursing degrees being offered by colleges and universities in the US. You can gain an associate's degree in nursing or a bachelors of science in nursing.: There are a number of online and on-campus institutes offering RN to BSN of nursing. For online nursing programs, you can look through our website. If you want to enroll in a bachelor of RN to BSN, you will need a diploma or an associate's degree in nursing.\n[12] On the other hand, BSN is a Bachelors of Science degree in Nursing, for which you need to qualify for the NCLEX-RN exam with either a BSN or ADN. The Bachelor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s degree provides you with more options for progress, and is required if you want to continue as a nursing specialist.\n[13] First of all, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s establish what each one stands for. A BSN is a Bachelor of Science in Nursing, while an ADN is an Associates Degree in Nursing. Both degrees lead to getting your RN but there are some differences between the two. The main difference is the length of time and the amount of credits required to complete the program.\n[14] The big difference is that a BSN is a degree and an RN is a license. Getting a degree doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean you have a license, and vice-versa. Related resource: 10 Reasons to Get Your Bachelor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Degree in Nursing. What is an RN?

RNs are very different from LPNs. The amount of schooling and education is longer for an RN. RNs usually go through two to four year programs at community colleges and universities. They graduate with a BSN (Bachelor's of Science In Nursing) or an ADN (Associate's Degree In Nursing).\n[17] You are considered a RN if you have a ASN (Associate of Science in Nursing) or a BSN (Bachelor of Science in Nursing). The difference with ASN and BSN is ASN is a 2 year degree and BSN is a 4 year degree. You will get paid more with a BSN. And I think hospitals are looking more for BSN students.If I were 18, I would go straight thru the 4 years.ut, you're still an RN either way. The best jobs will require the master's degree and have titles like Family Nurse Practitioner or Nurse Anesthetist with salaries nearing $100K per year. They are still an RN-they just have more training than most RNs.\n[18] NursingLink. First of all, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s establish what each one stands for.

People have stiff muscles and awkward movements. Forms of spastic cerebral palsy include: 1 Spastic hemiplegia/hemiparesis typically affects the arm and hand on one side of the body, but it can also include the leg.\n[2] Cerebral palsy types. Cerebral palsy is a word that we often hear but many fail to understand. People think cerebral palsy or CP as it is often called is a mental disorder or a birth injury and it is understandable why they think that way. Perhaps we should look at the name for clues. cerebral which means \u00e2\u0080\u0098of the brain\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and palsy which means \u00e2\u0080\u0098paralysis'. Cerebral palsy is a condition brought about following an injury to the brain and that covers the time a baby is in the womb as a neonate, during birth and the following two years, although experts cannot agree exactly how long this period extends.\n[3] Spastic Cerebral Palsy. Spastic cerebral palsy is the most common type of cerebral palsy. The muscles of people with spastic cerebral palsy appear stiff and their movements may look stiff and jerky. Spasticity is a form of hypertonia, or increased muscle tone.When people without cerebral palsy perform a movement, some groups of muscles turn on and some groups of muscles turn off. In people with spastic cerebral palsy, both groups of muscles may become turned on at the same time.pastic cerebral palsy is the most common type of cerebral palsy. The muscles of people with spastic cerebral palsy appear stiff and their movements may look stiff and jerky.\n[4] In about 25% of cases, ALS begins with brainstem symptoms (dysarthria, difficulty swallowing) followed by extremity weakness. This variant is called progressive bulbar palsy and has a worse prognosis. Some ALS patients have only lower motor neuron involvement (progressive muscular atrophy).egeneration may also infrequently involve sensory tracts. Spinal Spinal Muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetic disorder that causes degeneration and loss of spinal and brain stem motor neurons (lower motor neurons) resulting in progressive muscle weakness.\n[5] Spastic cerebral palsy, or cerebral palsy where spasticity (muscle tightness) is the exclusive or almost exclusive impairment present, is by far the most common type of overall cerebral palsy, occurring in upwards of 70% of all cases.\n[6] There are four types of spastic CP, grouped according to how many limbs are affected. Hemiplegia or diplegia: One arm and one leg on the same side of the body (hemiplegia) or both legs (diplegia or paraplegia) are affected. These are the most common types of spastic cerebral palsy.\n[7] Cerebral palsy is a general term describing conditions that cause movement problems. The most common type is spastic cerebral palsy where the muscles are stiff and rigid in one or more limbs. The underlying problem is damage to, or faulty development of, part of the brain.This usually occurs sometime before birth.or example, severe prolonged lack of oxygen during birth may be a cause in a small number of cases. Problems can occur after birth. For example, meningitis or other brain infections that occur in young babies can cause brain damage resulting in cerebral palsy.\n[8] The term dysarthria does not include speech disorders from structural abnormalities, such as cleft palate, and must not be confused with apraxia of speech, which refers to problems in the planning and programming aspect of the motor-speech system.ysarthria may affect a single system; however, it is more commonly reflected in multiple motor-speech systems. The etiology, degree of neuropathy, existence of co-morbidities, and the individual's response all play a role in the effect the disorder has on the individual's quality of life.\n[9] Four types of brain injury or malformation that cause Cerebral Palsy. Cerebral Palsy is caused by brain injury or brain malformation that occurs before, during, or immediately after birth while the infant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brain is under development.\n[10] What is cerebral palsy (CP)?

In addition to this children suffering from this have other disabilities as well such as issues with muscles that help in the function of the tongue and mouth, mental retardation and problems in speaking.\n[16] Dysarthria is a condition in which you have difficulty saying words because of problems with the muscles that help you talk. In a person with dysarthria, a nerve, brain, or muscle disorder makes it difficult to use or control the muscles of the mouth, tongue, larynx, or vocal cords. The muscles may be weak or completely paralyzed. Or, it may be hard for the muscles to work together. Dysarthria may be the result of brain damage due to:\n[17] Dysarthria in children is usually developmental, while dysarthria in adults is often acquired, although both types can affect people of any age. Whether dysarthria will improve with speech and language therapy depends on the cause and the extent of the brain damage or dysfunction.\n[18] Signs and Symptoms of Cerebral Palsy. All types of cerebral palsy are characterized by abnormal muscle tone (i.e. slouching over while sitting), reflexes, or motor development and coordination. There can be joint and bone deformities and contractures (permanently fixed, tight muscles and joints).\n[19] Cerebral palsy is caused by traumatic injury to a developing brain, including the parts of the brain responsible for motor control, coordination and balance. Damage to different parts of the brain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s motor control centers causes different types of cerebral palsy.ll of these components relay the impulses from the brain to the nerves and muscles that control movement.

Dysarthria often is characterized by slurred or slow speech that can be difficult to understand. Common causes of dysarthria include nervous system (neurological) disorders such as stroke, brain injury, brain tumors, and conditions that cause facial paralysis or tongue or throat muscle weakness.\n[2] There are seven different types of neuromuscular disease \u00e2\u0080\u0094 muscular dystrophies, cerebral palsy, motor neuron diseases, disorders of the neuromuscular junction, metabolic diseases of the muscle, peripheral nerve conditions, and various myopathies.\n[3] The motor disorders of cerebral palsy are often accompanied by disturbances of sensation, perception, cognition, communication and behavior, epilepsy, and by secondary musculoskeletal problems. The specific motor types present in CP are determined by the extent, type, and location of a child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abnormalities.

As the most common form of cerebral palsy (CP), hypertonic CP accounts for 80% of all cases in the United States. Hypertonic CP is considered spastic, marked by extremely stiff muscles. On the other hand, hypotonic CP, marked by extremely loose and floppy muscle tone, accounts for less than half of all CP cases.\n[9] Dysarthria In dysarthria, errors are consistent and predictable. There are no islands of clear speech; no matter what the speaking task or materials used, the patient will exhibit the same amount and types of errors. Errors are mainly distortions and omissions. Distortions are the most common type of error in dysarthria. Apraxia In apraxia, errors are inconsistent and unpredictable. Different error patterns occur in spontaneous speech versus repetition. Patients' spontaneous speech contains fewer errors than does his/her speech in repetition tasks.\n[10] The term dysarthria encompasses a group of motor speech disorders caused by a disturbance in the neuromuscular control of speech.

For example, a child with mixed CP may have some muscles that are too tight and others that are too relaxed, creating a mix of stiffness and floppiness.\n[10] Cerebral palsy (CP) refers to a group of chronic, nonprogressive disorders of movement, posture, and tone due to central nervous system damage before cerebral development is complete. The prevalence of CP is approximately 2 per 1,000 live births. The different types of CP vary from series to series, with the spastic type being the most frequent, while periventricular leukomalacia and/or cortical/cerebral atrophy represents the main neuropathological correlates [1].\n[11] Dysarthria is a condition in which the muscles you use for speech are weak or you have difficulty controlling them. Dysarthria often is characterized by slurred or slow speech that can be difficult to understand. Common causes of dysarthria include nervous system (neurological) disorders such as stroke, brain injury, brain tumors, and conditions that cause facial paralysis or tongue or throat muscle weakness.\n[12] There are seven different types of neuromuscular disease \u00e2\u0080\u0094 muscular dystrophies, cerebral palsy, motor neuron diseases, disorders of the neuromuscular junction, metabolic diseases of the muscle, peripheral nerve conditions, and various myopathies.\n[13] The motor disorders of cerebral palsy are often accompanied by disturbances of sensation, perception, cognition, communication and behavior, epilepsy, and by secondary musculoskeletal problems. The specific motor types present in CP are determined by the extent, type, and location of a child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abnormalities. (Fig. 1) SPASTIC CEREBRAL PALSY Spastic CP is the most common type. People will experience increased muscle tone and their movements may appear stiff or awkward.

Tremors or an unsteady gait are also common.\n[16] 1 Hemiplegia or diplegia: One arm and one leg on the same side of the body (hemiplegia) or both legs (diplegia or paraplegia) are affected. 2 These are the most common types of spastic cerebral palsy. 3 Monoplegia: Only one arm or leg is affected.\n[17] Hypertonic and Hypotonic Cerebral Palsy. As the most common form of cerebral palsy (CP), hypertonic CP accounts for 80% of all cases in the United States. Hypertonic CP is considered spastic, marked by extremely stiff muscles. On the other hand, hypotonic CP, marked by extremely loose and floppy muscle tone, accounts for less than half of all CP cases.\n[18] The term dysarthria encompasses a group of motor speech disorders caused by a disturbance in the neuromuscular control of speech. These disorders result from central or peripheral nervous system damage and are manifested as weakness, slowness, or incoordination of speech.\n[19] The key point is that dysarthria is a symptom, and diagnosis of the cause is essential. It may be due to a disorder of the brain (such as following a stroke) or nerve supply to the muscles of speech, which involve the face, the tongue, or the muscles of the throat. There are several types of dysarthria.\n[20] Dysarthria is a condition in which you have difficulty saying words because of problems with the muscles that help you talk. In a person with dysarthria, a nerve, brain, or muscle disorder makes it difficult to use or control the muscles of the mouth, tongue, larynx, or vocal cords. The muscles may be weak or completely paralyzed. Or, it may be hard for the muscles to work together.

Several cerebral palsy classification systems exist today to define the type and form of cerebral palsy an individual has. The classification is complicated by the wide range of clinical presentations and degrees of activity limitation that exist.\n[14] Cerebral palsy is one of the most common congenital (existing at or before birth) disorders of childhood. About 500,000 children in the United States have the condition. The three types of CP are: spastic cerebral palsy \u00e2\u0080\u0094 causes stiffness and movement difficulties.\n[15] Cerebral Palsy (CP) is an umbrella term to describe a group of disabilities that affect the motor control of individuals. The three classifications are Spastic, Ataxic and Athetoid. Spastic Cerebral Palsy affects people about 80% of the time and is characterized by muscle tension (known as \u00e2\u0080\u009chypertonic\u00e2\u0080\u009d) in the muscle stemming from a lesion in the motor cortex and brain. Ataxic Cerebral Palsy is reported in 10% of cases and the main brain damage is centered on the cerebellum.\n[16] [edit on Wikidata] Dysarthria is a motor speech disorder resulting from neurological injury of the motor component of the motor-speech system and is characterized by poor articulation of phonemes (cf. aphasia: a disorder of the content of language).\n[17] Motor disability types of CP. Spastic: Spastic cerebral palsy causes movements to be stiff or difficult to execute. In these types of cerebral palsy the muscles may not be able to relax properly.

Typically diagnosed between the ages of 9 months and 3 years old, cerebral palsy is an irreversible neurological disorder that causes significant musculoskeletal impairments, along with difficulty thinking, speaking and coordinating movement.\n[2] There are three types of cerebral palsy. Spastic CP is the most common form and affects the body s ability to relax muscles, causing tightness and difficulties in movement. Athetoid cerebral palsy affects the ability to control muscles, leading to involuntary and uncontrolled movements in the affected muscles.Children with Ataxic CP have a disturbed sense of balance and depth perception, characterized by tremors or shaky movements.thetoid cerebral palsy affects the ability to control muscles, leading to involuntary and uncontrolled movements in the affected muscles. Children with Ataxic CP have a disturbed sense of balance and depth perception, characterized by tremors or shaky movements.\n[3] The three types of Cerebral Palsy classified by the type of permanent disability caused by the permanent brain damage suffered during delivery, the permanent brain damage suffered at birth, or the permanent brain damage suffered shortly after birth are the following:Spastic Cerebral Palsy.or more information about spastic cerebral palsy, Click Here. Athetoid Cerebral Palsy. Children with athetoid cerebral palsy suffer an ever changing level of muscle tone. As a result, children with athetoid cerebral palsy suffer a constant succession of slow, writhing, involuntary movements.\n[4] Some of the types of speech impairments include: 1 Dysarthria, a physical weakness or paralysis of the speech muscles caused by nerve or brain damage. 2 Dysprosody, characterized by changes in the intensity of volume, timing of words, and rhythm and intonation of words while speaking.\n[5] 1 These are the most common types of spastic cerebral palsy. 2 Monoplegia: Only one arm or leg is affected. Quadriplegia : Both arms and both legs are affected. Usually the trunk and muscles that control the mouth, tongue, and windpipe are affected too. This makes eating and talking difficult.\n[6] 1 These are the most common types of spastic cerebral palsy. 2 Monoplegia: Only one arm or leg is affected. 3 Quadriplegia: Both arms and both legs are affected. 4 Usually the trunk and muscles that control the mouth, tongue, and windpipe are affected too. 5 This makes eating and talking difficult.\n[7] There are four different types of cerebral palsy. Spastic cerebral palsy is the most common form, affecting approximately 70 percent of all individuals with cerebral palsy. Spasticity can be either a mild or severe impairment of motor functions.\n[8] Traumatic brain injury and brain tumors are also causes of dysarthria. Slurred speech is the result of weakened or uncoordinated muscles within the throat or mouth. All of the aforementioned ailments can cause these types of speech impairment and muscular issues, states Mayo Clinic. Neuromuscular diseases, which affect the nervous system and the muscles, are often causes of dysarthria.\n[9] Dysarthria is a term used for a group of speech disorders caused by weakness, paralysis, rigidity, spasticity, sensory loss, or incoordination of muscle groups responsible for speech. All of the following Speech Disorders are caused by a pathology affecting the nervous system. Most neurogenic speech disorders fit into one of the dysarthria types.\n[10] There are several types of cerebral palsy, classified by the kind of movement affected, the body parts affected, and how severe the symptoms are. Some types involve intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs) as well as movement problems. Spastic cerebral palsy. This type is the most common form of the disorder.\n[11] Dysarthria is a motor speech disorder. It results from impaired movement of the muscles used for speech production, including the lips, tongue, vocal folds, and/or diaphragm. The type and severity of dysarthria depend on which area of the nervous system is affected. person with dysarthria may demonstrate the following speech characteristics: 1 Slurred, choppy, or mumbled speech that may be difficult to understand. 2 Slow rate of speech. 3 Rapid rate of speech with a mumbling quality. 4 Limited tongue, lip, and jaw movement.\n[12] Dysarthria is a motor speech disorder. It results from impaired movement of the muscles used for speech production, including the lips, tongue, vocal folds, and/or diaphragm. The type and severity of dysarthria depend on which area of the nervous system is affected.\n[13] Mixed dysarthria \u00e2\u0080\u0093 This is a difficult to define speech pattern caused by damage to several regions of the nervous system, such as the upper or lower motor neurons. Diagnosis of Dysarthria. Dysarthria and its more severe form, anarthria, are diagnosed by a medical professional.\n[14] Dysarthria does not include speech disorders from structural abnormalities, such as cleft palate, and must not be confused with apraxia of speech, which refers to problems in the planning and programming aspect of the motor-speech system.\n[15] Cerebral Palsy (CP) disorder of movement and posture caused by damage to the motor control centers of the developing brain and can occur during pregnancy about (75%) or after birth up to about age 3. Most common permanent disorder of childhood involving four motor dysfunctions: spastic, dyskinetic, ataxic, and mixed. Coma.\n[16] Spastic (pyramidal) cerebral palsy. Spastic cerebral palsy is the most common type. A person with spastic CP develops tight muscles in some parts of the body that are unable to relax. Affected joints become stiff and hard to move.Usually, a person has problems controlling movements, poor coordination and balance, and difficulty talking and eating. These are the most common types of spastic cerebral palsy. 2 Monoplegia: Only one arm or leg is affected. 3 Quadriplegia: Both arms and both legs are affected. 4 Usually the trunk and muscles that control the mouth, tongue, and windpipe are affected too. 5 This makes eating and talking difficult.\n[17] Athetosis is another characteristic of dyskinetic cerebral palsy, marked by slow twitching and wriggling movements. The symptoms can surface while resting and generally become worse when the child moves. Other common symptoms of athetosis include: Repetitive, jerky movements.\n[18] Spastic cerebral palsy is the most common type. A person with spastic CP develops tight muscles in some parts of the body that are unable to relax. Affected joints become stiff and hard to move.

Additionally, face or neck trauma or surgery affecting the tongue or voice box may also cause slurred speech, according to MedlinePlus.\n[4] The ability to speak may be impaired as a result of physical, not intellectual, impairment. Non-spastic cerebral palsy is divided into two groups, ataxic and dyskinetic. Together they make up 20% of cerebral palsy cases. Broken down, dyskinetic makes up 15% of all cerebral palsy cases, and ataxic comprises 5%.\n[5] Dyskinetic Athetoid Cerebral Palsy.

Of course, the text in the article may need some clarification and better citation.hough, authors sometimes use the the terms public key and secret key for the two keys in a key pair of a public key cryptosystem, for example when they also use symbols such as to refer to the two keys. 62.203.40.35 (talk) 21:41, 14 March 2009 (UTC).\n[13] Like a restricted stock award (RSA), a restricted stock unit (RSU) is a grant valued in terms of company stock. Unlike an RSA, no company stock is issued at the time of an RSU grant, and therefore no Special Tax 83(b) elections can be made at grant.\n[14] Your signature key and your encryption key are the same (of type RSA). You have one certificate for your one public key. (That's the most common case.) You have two distinct keys for signatures and for encryption; each public key is distributed in its own certificate. You have a key for signatures, and the public key is in a certificate signed by a regular CA.\n[15] Security is a prerequisite for e-services, and we are pleased to be working with RSA because they are the leaders in public-key cryptography, says Roberto Medrano, general manager of HP's Internet Security Div.\n[16] Medical dictionary definition of RS as a medical term including diseases, symptoms, treatments, and other medical and health issues. About Us Bookmark this page\n[17] This is sometimes referred to as certificate authentication, but certificates are just one of many ways to use public key technology. One of the core decisions in this field is the key size. Most people have heard that 1024 bit RSA keys have been cracked and are not used any more for web sites or PGP. The next most fashionable number after 1024 appears to be 2048, but a lot of people have also been skipping that and moving to 4096 bit keys.\n[18] Computer and Network Security by Avi Kak Lecture12. based on 512-bit blocks. [While, in principle, RSA can certainly be used as a. block cipher, in practice, on account of its excessive computational overhead, it is more. likely to be used just for server authentication and for exchanging a secret session key.\n[19] The formula for RSA for example, is designed for using numbers as input. Whether or not a vendor translates this into part of what determines a pseudo random number, for example, I dunno. The reason I only think it's a label for the key (so you can keep track of it).\n[20] This key has the ability to encrypt and decrypt the data. With asymmetric encryption such as Diffie-Hellman and RSA, a pair of keys is created and assigned: a private key and a public key. The public key can be known by anyone and used to encrypt data that will be sent to the owner. Once the message is encrypted, it can only be decrypted by the owner of the private key. Asymmetric encryption is said to be somewhat more secure than symmetric encryption as the private key is not to be shared.\nSearch Query: rsa definition key.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Asymmetric encryption is said to be somewhat more secure than symmetric encryption as the private key is not to be shared.\n[14] 1 Because RSA encryption is a deterministic encryption algorithm (i.e., has no random component) an attacker can successfully launch a chosen plaintext attack against the cryptosystem, by encrypting likely plaintexts under the public key and test if they are equal to the ciphertext.\n[15] When Alice receives Bob\u00e2\u0080\u0099s message she decrypts it by using her RSA private key (d, n) as follows: C d mod n = 48 103 mod 143 = 9 = M.

Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: medicare's definition of mechanical ventilation.\n\n[1] Mechanics of Ventilation. Ventilation, or breathing, is the movement of air through the conducting passages between the atmosphere and the lungs. The air moves through the passages because of pressure gradients that are produced by contraction of the diaphragm and thoracic muscles.\n[2] High frequency ventilation is a type of mechanical ventilation which utilizes a respiratory rate greater than 4 times the normal value. (>150 (Vf) breaths per minute) and very small tidal volumes.\n[3] Natural ventilation is the ventilation of a building without the aid of fans or other mechanical systems. Historically all buildings were ventilated naturally with the help of windows and skylights. Natural ventilation use the pressure difference or temperature difference to allow the flow of air through the building.t is the movement of air from one space to other as well as supply of fresh air into the air conditioned space. Mechanical ventilation assists in controlling the humidity, contaminants, air borne particles, and general air quality.\n[4] There are two main modes of mechanical ventilation within the two divisions: positive pressure ventilation, where air (or another gas mix) is pushed into the trachea, and negative pressure ventilation, where air is, in essence, sucked into the lungs.his may involve a machine called a ventilator or the breathing may be assisted by a registered nurse, physician, physician assistant, respiratory therapist, paramedic, or other suitable person compressing a bag or set of bellows.\n[5] - Ventilation is completely provided by the mechanical ventilator with a. preset tidal volume, respiratory rate and oxygen concentration prescribed. by the physician. -Ventilator totally controls the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ventilation i.e. the ventilator initiates. and controls both the volume delivered and the frequency of breath.\n[6] A ventilator delivers gas to the lungs with either negative or positive pressure. It must be understood that no mode of mechanical ventilation can or will cure a disease process but merely supports the patient until resolution of his/ her symptoms is accomplished.\n[7] Pressure-cycled ventilation. This form of mechanical ventilation includes pressure control ventilation (PCV), pressure support ventilation (PSV), and several noninvasive modalities applied via a tight-fitting face mask. In all of these modalities, the ventilator delivers a set inspiratory pressure.\n[8] negative pressure ventilation mechanical ventilation in which negative pressure is generated on the outside of the patient's chest and transmitted to the interior to expand the lungs and allow air to flow in; used with weak or paralyzed patients.ressure support ventilation positive pressure ventilation in which the patient breathes spontaneously and breathing is augmented with air at a preset amount of pressure, with tidal volume not being fixed.\n[9] Mechanical ventilation can be noninvasive, involving various types of face masks, or invasive, involving endotracheal intubation (see Airway Establishment and Control : Endotracheal tubes). Selection and use of appropriate techniques require an understanding of respiratory mechanics.\n[10] Mechanical ventilation can be noninvasive, involving various types of face masks, or invasive, involving endotracheal intubation (see Tracheal Intubation).

If chronic respiratory failure doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t improve with other treatments, your doctor may put you on a ventilator, or breathing machine. This machine pumps oxygen through a tube that is placed into your mouth or nose and down into your windpipe.\n[15] Common indications for mechanical ventilation include the following: 1 Bradypnea or apnea with respiratory arrest. 2 Acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome. 3 Tachypnea (respiratory rate >30 breaths per minute) Vital capacity less than 15 mL/ 1 kg. Minute ventilation greater than 10 L/ min.\n[16] CMS updated one of the documents on the Inpatient Hospital Reviews website recently to clarify that they consider newly initiated mechanical ventilation support to be similar to inpatient-only procedures and therefore an exception to the 2-Midnight Benchmark.\n[17] NIPPV (see also Overview of Mechanical Ventilation : Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV)) delivers positive pressure ventilation using nasal prongs or nasal masks. It can be synchronized (ie, triggered by the infant's inspiratory effort) or nonsynchronized.\n[18] the mechanical ventilator assists the patient s breathing depending on the needs of the patient for patients who need the greatest amount of assistance the ventilator fully controls the volume and duration of breath throughout the respiration cycle for non invasive patients how a ventilator works\n[19] ICU patients often require mechanical ventilation if they have lost the ability to breathe normally. An intensive care unit (ICU), also known as an intensive therapy unit or intensive treatment unit (ITU) or critical care unit (CCU), is a special department of a hospital or health care facility that provides intensive treatment medicine.\n[20] Advance Directives (Mechanical ventilation enables the client to breathe and prolongs survival, but it will not alter progression of the disease.

Mechanical ventilation is a method of forced or induced ventilation by using mechanical air handling systems, commonly called HVAC systems. Mechanical ventilation is more controllable than natural ventilation. In Mechanical Ventilation blowers, fans, filters, and ducts are used for transporting and removing air from a space.There are two types of fans used for the transmission of air. When the air enters the impellers axially and is discharged radially from the impeller, it is called a centrifugal or radial flow fan.t is the movement of air from one space to other as well as supply of fresh air into the air conditioned space.

Mechanical ventilation: Use of a machine called a ventilator or respirator to improve the exchange of air between the lungs and the atmosphere. Last Editorial Review: 5/13/2016.\n[2] Mechanical ventilation is the medical term for artificial ventilation where mechanical means is used to assist or replace spontaneous breathing.\n[3] Mechanical ventilation. For the use in architecture and climate control, see Ventilation (architecture). Mechanical ventilation is the medical term for artificial ventilation where mechanical means is used to assist or replace spontaneous breathing.\n[4] Mechanical ventilation is a life support treatment. A mechanical. ventilator is a machine that helps people breathe when they are not. able to breathe enough on their own. The mechanical ventilator is. also called a ventilator, respirator, or breathing machine. Most. patients who need support from a ventilator because of a severe. illness are cared for in a hospital\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intensive care unit (ICU).\n[5] Mechanical ventilation is the use of a mechanical device (machine) to inflate and deflate the lungs. Mechanical ventilation provides the force needed to deliver air to the lungs in a patient whose own ventilatory abilities are diminished or lost. Breathing requires the movement of air into and out of the lungs. This is normally accomplished by the diaphragm and chest muscles. A variety of medical conditions can impair the ability of these muscles to accomplish this task, including: muscular dystrophies.\n[6] Mechanical ventilation. Assisted ventilation could be defined as the movement of gas into and out of lungs by an external source connected directly to the patient. The external source could be the resuscitation bag, continuous distending pressure device or a mechanical ventilator.\n[7] Nasotracheal intubation In medicine, mechanical ventilation is a method to mechanically assist or replace spontaneous breathing. Mechanical ventilation is typically used after an invasive intubation, a procedure wherein an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube is inserted into the airway.\n[8] What Is Mechanical Ventilation? Mechanical ventilation, in the healthcare setting or home, helps patients breathe by assisting the inhalation of oxygen into the lungs and the exhalation of carbon dioxide. Depending on the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s condition, mechanical ventilation can help support or completely control breathing.\n[9] 1. Continuous mandatory ventilation. 2. A mode of mechanical respiration in which all breaths are mandatory and are either patient or machine triggered, and machine cycled; a minimum breathing rate is set but the patient can trigger breaths at a faster pace.\n[10] Ventilators are medical devices that provide mechanical ventilation to assist with or replace patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 spontaneous breathing. Mechanical ventilation is often categorized based on the interface used, such as a tracheostomy tube for invasive ventilation, or a mask for non-invasive ventilation.\n[11] Mechanical ventilation may be defined as the use of a mechanical device to provide. ventilator support for patients.

It is monotonically increasing if $x(1)=0.5$ instead, for example.\n[2] There are sequences which are convergent without being monotonic. For example, the sequences (-1 , 1/2 , -1/3 , 1/4 , ... ) and (1/2 , 1/22 , 1/3 , 1/32 , ... ) both converge to 0. For sequences given by recurrence relations it is sometimes easy to see what their limits are.\n[3] A function f (x) is concave over a convex set if and only if the function \u00e2\u0088\u0092 f (x) is a convex function over the set. A differentiable function f is concave on an interval if its derivative function f \u00e2\u0080\u00b2 is monotonically decreasing on that interval: a concave function has a decreasing slope. Any affine function is both (non-strictly) concave and convex. 2 The sine function is concave on the interval. 3 The function, where is the determinant of a nonnegative-definite matrix B, is concave. 4 Practical example: rays bending in computation of radiowave attenuation in the atmosphere.\n[4] Every survival function S (t) is monotonically decreasing, i.e. for all. The time, t = 0, represents some origin, typically the beginning of a study or the start of operation of some system. S (0) is commonly unity but can be less to represent the probability that the system fails immediately upon operation.\n[5] Definition of MONOTONIC. 1. : characterized by the use of or uttered in a monotone. 2. : having the property either of never increasing or of never decreasing as the values of the independent variable or the subscripts of the terms increase. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 mono\u00c2\u00b7ton\u00c2\u00b7i\u00c2\u00b7cal\u00c2\u00b7ly \\-ni-k(\u00c9\u0099-)l\u00c4\u0093\\ adverb.\n[6] And, a function is known as decreasing if y-value decreases when x is increases and denoted as if x 1 2 $\\Rightarrow$ f(x 1 2). A function that either increases or decreases everywhere in an Interval is called monotonic on the Interval.hen the function is increasing, the graph of the function rises from left to right.

First, let's establish some definitions: f is said to be increasing on an interval I if for all x in I, whenever. f is said to be decreasing on an interval I if for all x in I, whenever. A function is monotonic on an interval I if it is only increasing or only decreasing on I. The derivative can help us determine whether a function is increasing or decreasing on an interval. This knowledge will later allow us to sketch rough graphs of functions. Let f be continuous on [a, b] and differentiable on (a, b) . If for all x on (a, b) , then f is increasing on [a, b] . If for all x on (a, b) , then f is decreasing on [a, b] . This should make intuitive sense. In the graph below, wherever the slope of the tangent is positive, the function seems to be increasing.\n[8] A number of these properties can be combined. For example one can get monotonic reads combined with session level consistency. From a practical point of view these two properties (monotonic reads and read-your-writes) are most desirable in an eventually consistent system, but not always required.\n[9] The first derivative test examines a function's monotonic properties (where the function is increasing or decreasing) focusing on a particular point in its domain. If the function switches from increasing to decreasing at the point, then the function will achieve a highest value at that point.\n[10] On the negative numbers, numbers with greater absolute value have greater squares, so squaring is a monotonically decreasing function on (\u00e2\u0088\u0092\u00e2\u0088\u009e,0] .

Monotonic functions are the functions which maintained the order of functions value. As we all know that the variation in independent value also make the variation in functions value. A suitable example for this is monotonic functions or linear polynomials. The monotonic functions maintains the straight line in linear programming graph. This is also called the monotonic nature over the domain and real numbers. A monotonic function increases and decreases over the interval.\n[2] Montonic Function. When a function is increasing on its entire domain or decreasing on its entire domain, we say that the function is strictly monotonic, and we call it a monotonic function. For example, consider the function g(x) equals x 3: Notice the graph of g is increasing everywhere. Therefore, this is a monotonic function.\n[3] To solidify our understanding of what a monotonic function is, let's consider what a non-monotonic function is. A non-monotonic function is a function that is increasing and decreasing on different intervals of its domain. For example, consider our initial example f(x) equals x 2.\n[4] Monotonic Function. A monotonic function is a function which is either entirely nonincreasing or nondecreasing.

Somewhat inaccurately, a monotonic function can be defined as a function that always varies in the same direction.\n[6] In mathematics, a monotonic function (or monotone function) is a function between ordered sets that preserves or reverses the given order. This concept first arose in calculus, and was later generalized to the more abstract setting of order theory. 1 Monotonicity in calculus and analysis.\n[7] The MONOTONIC function is an undocumented SAS function. It needs no input parameters and if any input parameters are provided, these are ingnored. The function counts the number of times it is called and returns an ascending sequence of integers, starting at 1.\n[8] The MONOTONIC function is often presented as a means of adding sequence numbers to table rows. Several papers present it as a solution to this programming problem. If the MONOTONIC function is used in an SQL procedure that aggregates data then the function may return non-sequential or missing results.\n[9] The MONOTONIC function is often presented as a means of adding sequence numbers to table rows.

If the order in the definition of monotonicity is replaced by the strict order, then one obtains a stronger requirement.\n[19] Two facts about these functions are: 1 if is a monotonic function defined on an interval, then is differentiable almost everywhere on, i.e. the set of numbers in such that is not differentiable in has Lebesgue measure zero.2 In addition, this result cannot be improved to countable: see Cantor function.f the order in the definition of monotonicity is replaced by the strict order, then one obtains a stronger requirement. A function with this property is called strictly increasing. Again, by inverting the order symbol, one finds a corresponding concept called strictly decreasing.\n[20] Quite similarly, a function is termed as monotonically decreasing or a decreasing function if Y axis values do decrease as the X axis values are decreasing. The nature of increasing or decreasing function is to either increase or decrease throughout the function.\nSearch Query: example of monotonic function.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Common causes of suicide include: depression, drug abuse, financial problems, as well as difficulties with relationships. Although there are crisis hotlines that have been developed to help people feeling suicidal, the jury is out as to whether they even help.\n[2] \u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Problem of Suicide. Suicide is the second leading cause of death in young people. Each year in the U.S., approximately five thousand individuals between the ages of 15 and 24 take their own life. A major cause of suicide is mental illness, very commonly depression.\n[3] Suicide is the act of taking one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own life. It is one of the top causes of death in America. According to the latest statistics published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), suicide was the tenth leading cause of death in 2009 (CDC, 2009). Depression is not the only risk factor for suicide. Several risk factors contribute to thoughts of suicide, attempted suicide, and actual suicide. They include: 1 previous suicide attempts. 2 depression. 3 substance abuse (often accompanying an underlying mental disorder). 4 mental disorders. 5 incarceration.\n[4] RESULTS During the 22-year surveillance period, there were 29,213 deaths of U.S. military members while on active duty (Table 1) . Th e mean number of deaths per year was 1,328; the range was 795 (in 1997) to 1,941 (in 2007).\n[5] However, the success of the Army Suicide Prevention Program (ASPP) rests upon proactive, caring and courageous soldiers, family members and Army civilians who recognize the imminent danger and then take immediate action to save a life.\n[6] Epididymitis is most common in men aged 19 to 35 and is a frequent cause of military hospitalizations. Epididymitis is caused by an infection, usually a bacterial or a sexually transmitted infection. The condition usually improves with antibiotics.\n[7] What leads to suicide? There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no single cause for suicide. Suicide most often occurs when stressors exceed current coping abilities of someone suffering from a mental health condition. Depression is the most common condition associated with suicide, and it is often undiagnosed or untreated.\n[8] Teen suicide is a leading cause of death for people ages 15 to 24. Suicidal distress can be caused by psychological, environmental and social factors such as mental illness and substance abuse.\n[9] These numbers usually include both the deaths of military personnel which are the direct results of battle or other military wartime actions, as well as the wartime/war-related deaths of civilians, which are the results of war-induced epidemics, diseases, famines, atrocities, genocide, etc. Contents.\n[10] The Army Suicide Prevention Program (ASPP), a proponent of Deputy Chief of Staff, G-1 (DCS, G-1), has an Armywide commitment to provide resources for suicide intervention skills, prevention, and follow-up in an effort to reduce the occurrence of suicidal behavior across the Army enterprise.\n[11] But the military will have to change the way it handles soldiers with mental illness if we expect to see the number of suicides decline, according to the author of a related editorial published in the journal. VA boss: 'No veteran should have to wait for claims'.\n[12] Suicide is also one of the leading causes of death among this age group; the 2nd leading cause of death of males (112 deaths) and 6th for females (23 deaths). Suicide (including injury/poisoning of undetermined intent) was the leading cause of death for 20-34 year olds (24% of men and 12% of women). Factors that could lead to these deaths include: traumatic experiences, lifestyle choices such as drug or alcohol misuse, job insecurity and relationship problems.\n[13] Country with the most military deaths: Germany (2.1 million). Country with highest total death toll: Russia (3.8 million). Highest Percentage of population killed: Serbia (16.11%). 250,000 British Soldiers were suffered a partial or full amputation as a result of fighting in the First World War.\n[14] The Iraq War caused over a hundred thousand civilian deaths and tens of thousands of military deaths (see estimates below). The majority of deaths occurred as a result of the insurgency and civil conflicts between 2004 and 2007.\n[15] The rest were either unknown (21 percent), criminals (11 percent) or Iraqi forces (one percent). Heart conditions were the most common cause of non-violent death from 2003-2011 -- indicating a key role of stress in war-related deaths -- followed by chronic illness and cancer.\n[16] Deaths among Veterans serving during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars between 2001\u00e2\u0080\u00932007 (Veterans were followed through the end of 2009): 1 Deployed: 317,581 total Veterans, 1,650 total deaths. 21.3% death by suicide. 78.7% death by other causes.

Thoughts about harming yourself or suicide are just thoughts and do not mean you have to actually harm yourself.\n[19] Depression and desperation over debt have been the cause of many suicides over the course of history, especially during times of economic upheaval. Any of the aforementioned negative emotional responses to debt may be serious enough to require medical or psychological intervention.\n[20] 1 Suicide is the SECOND leading cause of death for ages 10-24. 2 Suicide is the SECOND leading cause of death for college-age youth and ages 12-18.

Many are dealing with difficult life situations or trauma and long separations from loved ones. 8 And they have access to the most common means for suicide: drugs and firearms.\n[5] One of the main causes of suicide in the socio-cultural category is the feeling of being isolated or not being accepted by others. Feelings of isolation can be caused by sexual orientation, religious beliefs, and gender identity.

Understanding and knowledge of these conditions is vital for developing appropriate public policies and responses to protect the public.DELAIDE: Suicide bombing attacks have become a weapon of choice among terrorist groups because of their lethality and ability to cause mayhem and fear. Though depressing, the almost daily news reports of deaths caused by suicide attacks rarely explain what motivates the attackers.\n[8] Over 6,800 US service members and over 6,900 contractors have died in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. An unusually high percentage of young veterans have died since returning home, many as a result of drug overdoses, vehicle crashes, or suicide. Coalition partners have died in large numbers: approximately 43,000 uniformed Afghans, Iraqis and other allies have died as of May 2014.\n[9] But on the whole, suicide rates for veterans in their first few years out of the military were lower than in the general population, according to research. The elevated rate today could reflect differences in who served, the study's authors speculate.\n[10] * Altruistic suicide occurs when the individual feels compelled to commit suicide for the good of the group.

The new study was based on data collected from 21 states in which military status is reported on the death certificate.\n[7] What was the main cause of death in the Civil War? The main cause of death in the Civil War was disease because of the unsanitary conditions in hospitals used to care for wounded soldiers.

Some population groups have a combination of risk factors that make them especially vulnerable: Military personnel, for example, are predominately young, male, and white. Many are dealing with difficult life situations or trauma and long separations from loved ones. 8 And they have access to the most common means for suicide: drugs and firearms.\n[16] One of the main causes of suicide in the socio-cultural category is the feeling of being isolated or not being accepted by others. Feelings of isolation can be caused by sexual orientation, religious beliefs, and gender identity. Other possible suicide catalysts from this category include: 1 difficulty seeking help.\n[17] * Altruistic suicide occurs when the individual feels compelled to commit suicide for the good of the group.

Many of these suicides involve older veterans; 69 percent of the suicides recorded were by veterans age 50 and older. But another way to look at this is that 31 percent of these suicides were by veterans 49 and younger. In other words,by men in the prime of life. And then there are the shockingly common active duty suicides. Just two weeks ago, the military released data showing that suicides among those on active duty hit a record high in 2012. There were 349 suicides among active duty personnel \u00e2\u0080\u0093 almost one a day. That means there are now more suicides among active duty soldiers than there are combat deaths.\n[7] A misunderstood statistic: 22 military veteran suicides a day.

The number of suicides among America's troops, averaging nearly one a day this year, has become the second leading cause of death among the military at the fastest pace in the nation's decade of war.\n[2] Military and civilian fatalities According to WHO World health report 2004, deaths from intentional injuries (including war, violence, and suicide) were estimated to be 2.8% of all deaths. In the same report, unintentional injury was estimated to be responsible for 6.2% of all deaths.\n[3] We suggest that moral injury is likely one of the most important factors in military suicide rates. Moral injury is not PTSD. The latter is a dysfunction of brain areas that suppress fear and integrate feeling with coherent memory; symptoms include flashbacks, nightmares, dissociative episodes and hyper-vigilance.

According to the January 2014 Veterans Health Administration report (PDF | 855 KB), the suicide rate among male and female veterans and military service members exceeds the national rate for the general population. Veterans comprise 20% of national suicides, with approximately 22 veterans dying by suicide every day.\n[15] Among full-time soldiers, the suicide rate soared to 29.7 deaths per 100,000 in 2012, well above a 25.1-per-100,000 rate for civilians of a similar age group during 2010, the latest year available, according to a Pentagon report. Among male soldiers, the rate was 31.8-per-100,000.\n[16] The suicide rate for men in the Army National Guard was 34.2-per-100,000,Pentagon data shows. For full-time troops across the U.S. military, the suicide rate peaked at 22.7-per-100,000 in 2012 and fell to 19.1-per-100,000 last year, according to the Pentagon.\n[17] Figures on the third quarters of 2015 and 2014 showed suicides in the active duty Navy increased to 11 from seven; in the active duty Air Force to 16 from 13; and in the active duty Army to 32 from 31.

Suicide Is Now the Leading Cause of Death Amongst Active-Duty Soldiers. In 2010, for the second year in a row, more American soldiers killed themselves than died in combat. Military officials knew they had an epidemic on their hands, but they didn't know how to mitigate the hyper-complex problem.\n[8] Suicide rates in the military were traditionally lower than among civilians in the same age range, but in 2004 the suicide rate in the U.S. Army began to climb, surpassing the civilian rate in 2008. Substance use is involved in many of these suicides. The 2010 report of the Army Suicide Prevention Task Force found that 29 percent of active duty Army suicides from fiscal year (FY) 2005 to FY 2009 involved alcohol or drug use; and in 2009, prescription drugs were involved in almost one third of them.\n[9] List Notes: Data is top 5 causes of death in the United States military for the year 2012-2013.

According to WHO World health report 2004, deaths from intentional injuries (including war, violence, and suicide) were estimated to be 2.8% of all deaths. In the same report, unintentional injury was estimated to be responsible for 6.2% of all deaths. See also.

They grow rapidly during the first year, but the growth rate varies a lot even for fish from the same spawn, so the size of year old goldfish varies widely. Almost all of the goldfish you see in the big box pet stores are well under a year in age.\n[7] Goldfish have a great need for oxygen content and thrive in tanks with a large surface area, so a long, wide tank is better than a deep one. A large surface area allows the oxygen from the atmosphere to migrate into the water. Also important is the water quality of the tank.\n[8] Goldfish bowls really shouldn't exist, to be honest. Goldfish can grow very large and some have lived up to 30 years! The recommendation is that you give a goldfish 10 gallons for every inch it is. So if your goldfish is 2 inches long, ideally it would have 20 gallons. While that seems a little excessive for most people, a ten gallon tank with a filter would be a great place to start. As other people have mentioned, goldfish are considered dirty fish.\n[9] In terms of a minimum temperature, goldfish can survive in water that is close to freezing, however, you should really keep your tank temperature several degrees above this in order to encourage strong growth.The most important thing is that your tank temperature does not change suddenly.herefore, to encourage your goldfish to lay eggs, you should lower the temperature of your tank in the winter months to between 10\u00c2\u00b0C/50\u00c2\u00b0F and 12\u00c2\u00b0C/54\u00c2\u00b0F.\n[10] Goldfish Size and Life Expectancy.

They will grow faster, but not necessarily ultimately larger, in large ponds than in aquaria. People who say they get to be three feet long probably have goldfish confused with koi or other carp.\n[12] Goldfish can live for many years if properly cared for, a bowl is not large enough. My goldfish lived 10 years in a 27 gallon tank but may have lived longer in a pond. 1 liter won't be enough - goldfish can grow to 10 inches long or even larger than that. Thanks guys I was so worried but not anymore.\n[13] Fry are too small to eat the same food as adult goldfish. After 48 hours, you can start to feed them liquid food, especially designed for them. The protein in cooked yolk of hard-boiled eggs will help them grow. At two months, they will be able to manage larger food.\n[14] In the wild, goldfish can be found in slow-moving, freshwater bodies of water. As with their close relative the carp, they thrive in slightly murky water. In captivity, an aquarium with live plants and a dirt bottom is ideal. Bi-weekly water changes are a good idea as a goldfish tank is hard to keep clean.\n[15] If that isn't obvious enough, consider the whiskers. Koi have barbels around their mouths and chins, feelers that resemble whiskers, while goldfish have no barbels. The body shapes and sizes of the two fish differ, too. Fully matured goldfish are typically 8 to 12 inches, growing to 16 inches at their largest.\n[16] Of course the betta will fight back, male OR female, and will probably kill the gold-fish. When asking this question it is important to use common sense: a goldfish can grow over 12 inches long, bettas typically don't grow over 3 inches (even less for the females).t depends. If you get a goldfish that is the same size or larger than your betta fish, I would not recommend putting it in with your betta. I have a 10 gallon fish tank with 3 fish in it.

A tank temperature of approximately 23\u00c2\u00b0C/74\u00c2\u00b0F will be high enough to encourage a good rate of growth in your goldfish, without being so high that your goldfish become stressed.\n[18] In terms of a minimum temperature, goldfish can survive in water that is close to freezing, however, you should really keep your tank temperature several degrees above this in order to encourage strong growth.The most important thing is that your tank temperature does not change suddenly.ir supply.

It's best to provide at least one gallon of water per full grown fish. This gives goldfish room to swim and explore their home. Plan the aquarium space according to how big the fish can become, not how big he is at the time of purchase.\n[2] Goldfish ponds need to provide clean, well oxygenated water for its inhabitants to grow up happy and healthy. A goldfish can grow up to 12 inches(30cm) plus. The minimum size pond is 8 feet X 6 feet and 3 feet deep(2.5m X 2m X 1m).\n[3] Fancy Goldfish (Ryukins, orandas, fan tail, bubble eyes) - Grow about 6 inches. Ranchus, Lion heads, Pearl Scales-grow about 3 - 4 inches. Common Goldfish (comets) - They can reach lengths of 2 feet or more. Koi-grow about 12 - 24 inches, sometimes more.\n[4] Koi and other goldfish can grow very large, sometimes reaching lengths of over 3 feet (0.9 m)! They're best housed in large ponds with a TON of filtration and weekly water changes. With the right size pond, filter and other equipment, caring for koi and goldfish can be lots of fun.\n[5] They vary in their fin configuration, coloration and in their body size, which is directly influenced by their environment. When they are kept as pets in small fish tanks and aquariums, goldfish tend to stay about 1-2 inches long and never grow larger than 6 inches (15 centimeters), according to the DEC. However, in the wild, goldfish often reach 12 to 14 inches (30 to 35 cm) in length.\n[6] No, a fish bowl is just too small for a fish that has the potential to grow over 12 inches in length. A goldfish needs an aquarium of at least 30 gallons (with proper filtrati \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 on and aeration) to thrive. Only a betta can live in a fish bowl. Goldfish generally don't get as big as they say but they do get large.\n[7] How fast do goldfish grow is really a tough question to answer really. As mentioned above these factors will influence the growth potential of your goldfish. For example the how clean your water is impacts how fast they will grow. If the water is too clear then lacks algae and food to feed on.\n[8] So to really answer the question, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow Fast Do Goldfish Grow\u00e2\u0080\u009d really has too many factors to really answer. Also genetics plays a part in this as well. If you look at some people today some are skinny, some are large, medium, petite, tall and short. Everyone grows differently and the same goes for goldfish.\n[9] The goldfish food that you feed them plays a part in their growth as well. If you want your goldfish to grow fast consider feeding them a wide variety of food. Also high growth food will help as well maximizing the growth of your goldfish.\n[10] Goldfish are a specially-bred ornamental variety of carp and thus would eat naturally-occurring carp food in the wild, such as insects, tadpoles and so forth. Fairground goldfish can live for years and grow to astounding proportions, and like all carp can learn to feed from a human hand. (Watch out for the teeth.) They can also be released into the wild and will happily interbreed with local carp, losing their conspicuous colouring after a few generations.\n[11] Goldfish may grow to a maximum length of 23 inches (59 cm) and a maximum weight of 9.9 pounds (4.5 kg), although this is rare; most individual goldfish grow to under half this size.

Nerve Ending (Presynaptic Terminals) Synapses are the junctions formed with other nerve cells where the presynaptic terminal of one cell comes into 'contact' with the postsynaptic membrane of another. It is at these junctions that neurons are excited, inhibited, or modulated. There are two types of synapse, electrical and chemical.\n[9] The junction between the axon terminals of a neuron and the receiving cell is called a synapse.

All somatic motorneurons release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) from their synaptic knobs. ACh isalways excitatory at synapses with skeletal muscle fibers; a synapse between a motor neuron anda muscle fiber is called a neuromuscular junction.\n[11] 1 INTRODUCTION A neuromuscular junction is a synapse between a motoneuron and a muscle cell it innvervates. The prejunctional nerve terminal is a transducer that converts an electrical signal (an action potential in the prejunctional motoneuron) into a chemical signal (transmitter release).t the neuromuscular junction (figure to the right) the terminal branch of the motor axon lies in a shallow groove, or synaptic trough, on the muscle cell. The muscle plasma membrane that forms the synaptic trough is pleated to form postjunctional folds.\n[12] What is the structure at the end of an axon that produces neurotransmitters? The axon is a single process extending from the axon hillock,sometimes covered by a fatty layer called a myelin sheath thatconducts nerve impulses away from the cell body of t \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 he neuron. Distal tips of axons are telodendria, each of which terminates in a synaptic knob.\n[13] At the neuromuscular junction (figure to the right) the terminal branch of the motor axon lies in a shallow groove, or synaptic trough, on the muscle cell. The muscle plasma membrane that forms the synaptic trough is pleated to form postjunctional folds.\n[14] It is composed of neurons, or nerve cells, which receive and transmit impulses, and neuroglia, also known as glial cells or more commonly as just glia (from the Greek, meaning glue), which assist the propagation of the nerve impulse as well as providing nutrients to the neuron.he bulb-like end of the axon, called the axon terminal, is separated from the dendrite of the following neuron by a small gap called a synapse. When the action potential travels to the axon terminal, neurotransmitters are released across the synapse and bind to the post-synaptic receptors, continuing the nerve impulse.\n[15] The synaptic knob contains vesicles filled with neurotransmitters. Therefore, Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter that stimulates skeletal muscle to contract. It is rele \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 ased into the synaptic clefts between motor neuron axons and motor end plates.\n[16] If the myelinating cell is wrapped around a nerve cell in the PNS, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a Schwann cell. Between the myelinating cells are these gaps called Nodes of Ranvier.

When an action potential is generated, it travels (propagates) the length an axon to the synapatic knobs, where it signals the synaptic vesicles to release some of the stored neurotransmitters.\n[2] Synapse. As an electrical impulse travels down the tail of the cell, called the axon and arrives at its terminal, it triggers vesicles containing a neurotransmitter to move toward the terminal membrane. The vesicles fuse with the terminal membrane to release their contents.

Nerve impulses are transmitted across this cleft by means of a neurotransmitter. Also called synaptic gap.\n[5] A single axon, with all its branches taken together, can innervate multiple parts of the brain and generate thousands of synaptic terminals. A bundle of axons make a nerve tract in the central nervous system, and a fascicle in the peripheral nervous system. The largest white matter tract in the brain is the corpus callosum formed of some 20 million axons.\n[6] The sequence of events at a synapse is as follows : 1) A nerve impulse reaches the axon terminal of a presynaptic neuron; the membrane is depolarised by an action potential. 2) Depolarisation of the axon terminal during the action potential causes voltage sensitive calcium ion channels to open in the terminal knob.he sequence of events at a synapse is as follows : 1) A nerve impulse reaches the axon terminal of a presynaptic neuron; the membrane is depolarised by an action potential. 2) Depolarisation of the axon terminal during the action potential causes voltage sensitive calcium ion channels to open in the terminal knob.\n[7] Neurotransmission, also called synaptic transmission, is the process by which signaling molecules called neurotransmitters are released by the axon terminal of a neuron, and bind to and activate the receptors on the dendrites of another neuron. A similar process occurs in retrograde neurotransmission, where the dendrites of the postsynaptic neuron release retrograde neurotransmitters that signal through receptors that are located on the axon terminal of the presynaptic neuron, mainly at GABAergi\n[8] Synapse.

There are three main types of neurons: (1) sensory neuron, (2) interneuron, and (3) motor neuron. The nerve cells of the central nervous system are all interneurons. In human brain, there are about 100 billion interneurons. Example is the Golgi cell found in the cerebellum. The interneurons receive impulses from the sensory neurons.\n[10] The junction between the axon terminals of a neuron and the receiving cell is called a synapse.

The chemical message then interacts with the recipient neuron or effector. This process is called synaptic transmission. Continue Reading.\n[3] The synapse is located at the end of each axonal end branch. Here the end branch forms a small button-like knob, referred to as the synaptic knob. This knob is adjacent to a tiny cleft or synapse. When a nerve impulse reaches this knob, a drug called a neurotransmitter is released from vesicles into the synapse. The neurotransmitter diffuses across the gap and binds to receptors on the membrane of the adjacent neuron or muscle cell.\n[4] Presynaptic Knob Definition of Presynaptic Knob :An area at the end of an axon that contains neurotransmitters in synaptic vesicles.

The first step is rapid opening of calcium ion channels in the membrane of the axon, allowing calcium ions to flow inward across the membrane.\n[6] The axon is wrapped in myelin, which ensheathes some sections but leaves sections of the axon bare between the sheathed portions. At its far end, the axon splits up into many axon terminal. Each forms a synapse with a dendrite or cell body of another neuron. The cell to which the axon terminal belongs (sending cell) is called the presynaptic cell, while the cell to which the dendrite or cell body belongs (receiving cell) is called the postsynaptic cell. There is a space between the two cells, across which they communicate.\n[7] Axons and dendrites differ in terms of structure. The term dendrite is derived from the Greek dendron, which means tree. Microscopically, dendrites have a treelike appearance, are heavily branched, and have multiple boutons, terminal knobs, or synaptic knobs. These knobs give dendrites a rough appearance.\n[8] The axon terminals of all neurons end at another structure that they stimulate (or inhibit). The connection between the two is called a synapse. Depending on the neuron, the synapse may be with another neuron (for sensory and interneurons) or a muscle fiber or a gland cell (for motor neurons).\n[9] Answered by The Community.

Continue Reading.\n[13] The synapse is located at the end of each axonal end branch. Here the end branch forms a small button-like knob, referred to as the synaptic knob. This knob is adjacent to a tiny cleft or synapse. When a nerve impulse reaches this knob, a drug called a neurotransmitter is released from vesicles into the synapse. The neurotransmitter diffuses across the gap and binds to receptors on the membrane of the adjacent neuron or muscle cell.\n[14] Presynaptic Knob Definition of Presynaptic Knob :An area at the end of an axon that contains neurotransmitters in synaptic vesicles. Presynaptic Knob is part of the Chemical Synapse Component group.\n[15] An axon (from Greek \u00e1\u00bc\u0084\u00ce\u00be\u00cf\u0089\u00ce\u00bd ax\u00c5\u008dn, \u00c3\u00a1x\u00c5\u008dn), axis is a, long slender projection of a nerve, cell or, neuron that typically conducts electrical impulses away from the'neuron s cell.

The first step is rapid opening of calcium ion channels in the membrane of the axon, allowing calcium ions to flow inward across the membrane.\n[16] The axon is wrapped in myelin, which ensheathes some sections but leaves sections of the axon bare between the sheathed portions. At its far end, the axon splits up into many axon terminal. Each forms a synapse with a dendrite or cell body of another neuron. The cell to which the axon terminal belongs (sending cell) is called the presynaptic cell, while the cell to which the dendrite or cell body belongs (receiving cell) is called the postsynaptic cell. There is a space between the two cells, across which they communicate.\n[17] Axons and dendrites differ in terms of structure. The term dendrite is derived from the Greek dendron, which means tree. Microscopically, dendrites have a treelike appearance, are heavily branched, and have multiple boutons, terminal knobs, or synaptic knobs. These knobs give dendrites a rough appearance.\n[18] The axon terminals of all neurons end at another structure that they stimulate (or inhibit). The connection between the two is called a synapse. Depending on the neuron, the synapse may be with another neuron (for sensory and interneurons) or a muscle fiber or a gland cell (for motor neurons).\n[19] Answered by The Community. Making the world better, one answer at a time.

Eubacteria are the only species in which introns have not been found.\n[6] Introns and exons are parts of genes. Exons code for proteins, whereas introns do not. A great way to remember this is by considering introns as intervening sequences and exons as expressed sequences. According to researchers, there are an average of 8.8 exons and 7.8 introns per human gene.\n[7] genome. exons. genetic code.

Quick Answer. An intron is a nucleotide sequence found within the genes and is removed via RNA splicing when a mature RNA molecule is being generated; on the other hand, an exon is a nucleic acid sequence present in a mature messenger RNA molecule.\n[13] Introns and exons are parts of genes. Exons code for proteins, whereas introns do not. A great way to remember this is by considering introns as intervening sequences and exons as expressed sequences. (1) According to researchers, there are an average of 8.8 exons and 7.8 introns per human gene.\n[14] Representation of intron and exons within a simple gene containing a single intron. An intron is any nucleotide sequence within a gene that is removed by RNA splicing during maturation of the final RNA product. The term intron refers to both the DNA sequence within a gene and the corresponding sequence in RNA transcripts. Sequences that are joined together in the final mature RNA after RNA splicing are exons.\n[15] Gene Distributions and Chromosome size. The average number of exons in human genes is about 8-10 and the mean value of 8.8 exons per gene. Exon lengths are distributed much more tightly (S.D.=192.23 - 396.79) than introns on each chromosome (see below).The average exon length is about 170bp.tarting with 26,564 genes, we filtered out 233,785 exons and 207,344 introns from the human genome. The results of exon (exons in the coding region) and intron (introns between the coding exons) distributions were tabulated for further analysis.\n[16] Human genes are made of small parts, called exons, which are separated by long non-coding DNA sequences, called introns. When a gene is transcribed, the intervening introns are cut or \u00e2\u0080\u009cspliced\u00e2\u0080\u009d out, and the exons are strung back together to form the sequence that is then translated into protein.\n[17] 1 The base sequences that appear in eukaryotic DNA and are used to make mRNA for a specific protein are the exons of a gene.\n[18] Priya Rani Verma, 6-Years teaching experience of Biology/Biotechnology Answered Apr 5, 2016 \u00c2\u00b7 Author has 126 answers and 220.6k answer views Introns and exons were discovered independently by American molecular biologists Richard Roberts and Phillip Sharp in 1977.\n[19] Functional cysts.

Exons and introns are related to genes. An exon is termed as a nucleic acid sequence which is represented in the RNA molecule. Introns, on the other hand, are termed as nucleotide sequences seen within the genes which are removed through RNA splicing for generating a mature RNA molecule.\n[16] Introns and exons are parts of genes. exons code for proteins, whereas introns do not. Exons are parts of DNA that are converted into mature messenger RNA . The process by which DNA is used as a template to create mRNA is called transcription.\n[17] Eukaryotic genes are split up into parts that are expressed as RNA products and parts that are not. The parts that are expressed are called exons. They appear in short sequences scattered throughout the gene. Exons are the parts of a eukaryotic gene that are expressed through transcription and translation.\n[18] The human genome consists of 3 billion nucleotides or \u00e2\u0080\u009cletters\u00e2\u0080\u009d of DNA.

The list of causes includes hypertension, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, hemochromatosis, and pulmonary blood clots, to name a few.\n[2] An increase or enlargement in the size of the right ventricle of the heart is called right ventricular hypertrophy. Edema in the ankles, legs, and feet may be a manifestation of right ventricular hypertrophy. Severe enlargement of the right venticule can cause shortness of breath and chest pain. Along with discovering an enlarged heart, a chest x-ray can expose other conditions that may have lead to the enlargement.\n[3] However, there are other conditions in which elevated T-waves can present such as myocardial infarction (heart attack), or a condition known as left ventricular hypertrophy in which the chamber of the heart responsible for pumping your blood to the rest of your body becomes enlarged (probably due to being overworked).\n[4] Hypertensive heart disease is the No. 1 cause of death associated with high blood pressure. It refers to a group of disorders that includes heart failure, ischemic heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, and left ventricular hypertrophy (excessive thickening of the heart muscle). Heart failure does not mean the heart has stopped working.\n[5] Hypertensive heart disease is the No. 1 cause of death associated with high blood pressure. It refers to a group of disorders that includes heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and left ventricular hypertrophy (excessive thickening of the heart muscle). What Is Heart Failure? Heart failure does not mean the heart has stopped working\n[6] Untreated, RVH can lead to a weakened heart or even heart failure. When the muscle thickens around one of the hearts lower chambers, it is a condition known as ventricular hypertrophy. The thicker heart muscle loses elasticity over time, causing the heart to work harder to effectively pump blood to the lungs, brain and the rest of the body.\n[7] Ventricular hypertrophy. Ventricular hypertrophy (VH) is thickening of the walls of a ventricle (lower chamber) of the heart.[1][2] Although left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is more common, right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), as well as concurrent hypertrophy of both ventricles can also occur.\n[8] Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can cause obstruction of blood as it exits the heart (left ventricle). This does not occur in all patients. A pressure gradient is generated between the heart and the aorta (the large blood vessel that the heart pumps blood into as it.\n[9] As enlargement progresses, though, the heart's pumping ability declines. Dilated cardiomyopathy is the main type of cardiomegaly. In dilated cardiomyopathy, the walls of both the left and right side of the heart (ventricles) become thin and stretched. The result is an enlarged heart. In the other types of enlarged heart, the heart's muscular left ventricle becomes abnormally thick. High blood pressure usually causes left ventricular enlargement (hypertrophy), while hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is an inherited condition.\n[10] Hypertensive heart disease is the No. 1 cause of death associated with high blood pressure. It refers to a group of disorders that includes heart failure, ischemic heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, and left ventricular hypertrophy (excessive thickening of the heart muscle).\n[11] Right ventricular hypertrophy is a form of ventricular hypertrophy affecting the right ventricle. Blood travels through the right ventricle to the lungs via the pulmonary arteries. If conditions occur which decrease pulmonary circulation, meaning blood does not flow well from the heart to the lungs, extra stress can be placed on the right ventricle. This can lead to right ventricular hypertrophy. It can affect electrocardiography findings. An ECG with right ventricular hypertrophy may or may not\n[12] Cardiomegaly is not a disease but rather a condition that can result from a host of other diseases such as obesity or coronary artery disease. Recent studies suggest that cardiomegaly is associated with a higher risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD).n this condition, the walls of both the left and right side of the heart (ventricles) become thin and stretched. The result is an enlarged heart. In the other types of cardiomegaly, the heart's large muscular left ventricle becomes abnormally thick. Hypertrophy is the usually what causes left ventricular enlargement.\n[13] Inherited (passed on from family) conditions present at birth of the. heart muscle: Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy \u00e2\u0080\u0093. hypertrophy (thickening) of the left. ventricle; the most common cause of. sudden cardiac arrest in athletes in. the U.S. Cardiomyopathy \u00e2\u0080\u0093. part of the right ventricle by fat and. scar; the most common cause of. sudden cardiac arrest in Italy. Marfan Syndrome \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a disorder of the. them prone to rupture; often. associated with very long arms and. unusually flexible joints.\n[14] Lifestyle changes can help lower your blood pressure and improve left ventricular hypertrophy signs. Consider: Weight loss. Left ventricular hypertrophy is often found in obese people regardless of blood pressure. Losing weight has been shown to reverse left ventricular hypertrophy. Limiting salt in your diet.\n[15] While ventricular hypertrophy occurs naturally as a reaction to aerobic exercise and strength training, it is most frequently referred to as a pathological reaction to cardiovascular disease, or high blood pressure. It is one aspect of ventricular remodeling.\n[16] High blood pressure and heart disease. Hypertensive heart disease is the number one cause of death associated with high blood pressure. It is actually a group of disorders that include heart failure, ischaemic heart disease and left ventricular hypertrophy (excessive thickening of the heart muscle).\n[17] While ventricular hypertrophy occurs naturally as a reaction to aerobic exercise and strength training, it is most frequently referred to as a pathological reaction to cardiovascular disease, or high blood pressure. It is one aspect of ventricular remodeling. While LVH itself is not a disease, it is usually a marker for disease involving the heart.\n[18] Hypertensive heart disease is the No. 1 cause of death associated with high blood pressure. It refers to a group of disorders that includes heart failure, ischemic heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, and left ventricular hypertrophy (excessive thickening of the heart muscle).igh blood pressure can also cause ischemic heart disease. This means that the heart muscle isn't getting enough blood. Ischemic heart disease is usually the result of atherosclerosis or hardening of the arteries (coronary artery disease), which impedes blood flow to the heart.\n[19] The underlying commonality in these disease states is an increase in pressures that the ventricles experience. For example, in tetralogy of Fallot, the right ventricle is exposed to the high pressures of the left heart due to a defect in the septum; as a result the right ventricle undergoes hypertrophy to compensate for these increased pressures.\n[20] The diagram shows a healthy heart (left) and one suffering from ventricular hypertrophy (right). The ventricles are the chambers in the heart responsible for pumping blood either to the lungs (right ventricle) or to the rest of the body (left ventricle).\nSearch Query: causes of left ventricular hypertrophy.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Although left ventricular hypertrophy is more common, enlargement can also occur in the right ventricle, or both ventricles. 1 Physiology.\n[2] In particular, an enlarged heart is a common cause of heart failure. The right and left sides of your heart do different jobs. The right side takes in blood that has travelled round the body and pumps it to the lungs. From here, the blood enters the left side of the heart from where it is pumped all round your body. Because the left side of the heart has to work harder to get blood round your body, it is usually this side that becomes enlarged when your blood pressure is too high. This is sometimes called left ventricular hypertrophy or LVH for short. In other words, it is another name for an enlarged heart.\n[3] Group 2: Pulmonary hypertension caused by left-sided heart disease. Left-sided valvular heart disease, such as mitral valve or aortic valve disease; Failure of the lower left heart chamber (left ventricle) Group 3: Pulmonary hypertension caused by lung disease. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, such as emphysema\n[4] Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a primary disease of the heart muscle (myocardium) characterised by hypertrophy (an increase in the thickness) of the left ventricle, associated with an overactive left ventricle and a small left ventricular chamber.ypertrophic Cardiomyopathy. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a disease of the heart muscle. It can cause sudden death, particularly in young, active men. Medicines can prevent a fatal outcome. Further research is being carried out in the search for better treatments.\n[5] There are a few types of thickened left ventricle that can show up as LVH. Athletic hypertrophy occurs in highly trained athletes, such as marathon runners, as a natural result of their intense, sustained heart rate. However, LVH in athletes generally regresses when they return to normal activity levels.\n[6] Dilated cardiomyopathy, which is the main type of cardiomegaly. In this condition, the walls of both the left and right side of the heart (ventricles) become thin and stretched. The result is an enlarged heart.In the other types of cardiomegaly, the heart's large muscular left ventricle becomes abnormally thick.Hypertrophy is the usually what causes left ventricular enlargement. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is typically an inherited condition.n this condition, the walls of both the left and right side of the heart (ventricles) become thin and stretched. The result is an enlarged heart. In the other types of cardiomegaly, the heart's large muscular left ventricle becomes abnormally thick. Hypertrophy is the usually what causes left ventricular enlargement.\n[7] In all three cases, the thickening of the muscle walls cause the heart chamber to be stiffer and smaller, making it difficult for blood to flow into and out of the heart effectively. This hypertrophy or thickening can progress to severe problems with obstruction of blood flow and relaxation of the left ventricle.\n[8] Left Ventricular Hypertrophy Symptoms. A person with a mildly enlarged heart may not have symptoms. Symptoms of an enlarged heart may include: Chest pain. Loss of appetite. Mild fatigue: Fatigue during exercise.\n[9] What Is Mild Cardiomegaly? This condition is marked by a minor increase in size of the heart. Mild cases of this disorder generally arise due to diseases like. General Hypertrophy. Hypertrophy is a condition that arises when an organ of the body suffers enlargement. Left Ventricular Hypertrophy. Hypertrophy affects only the left lower cardiac chamber.\n[10] What is Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)? Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a thickening (hypertrophy) of the muscles of the wall of the left ventricle of the heart causing the heart to be less able to relax between contractions. In some cases, this can lead to an increase in pressure in the left atrium which then enlarges.\n[11] Hypertensive heart disease is the No. 1 cause of death associated with high blood pressure.

It refers to a group of disorders that includes heart failure, ischemic heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, and left ventricular hypertrophy (excessive thickening of the heart muscle).igh blood pressure can also cause ischemic heart disease. This means that the heart muscle isn't getting enough blood. Ischemic heart disease is usually the result of atherosclerosis or hardening of the arteries (coronary artery disease), which impedes blood flow to the heart.\n[16] Treatment of Right Ventricular Hypertrophy The doctors of the patients with right ventricular hypertrophy addresses all the underlying causes of the disease to eventually treat it. The list of causes includes hypertension, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, hemochromatosis, and pulmonary blood clots, to name a few.\n[17] An increase or enlargement in the size of the right ventricle of the heart is called right ventricular hypertrophy. Edema in the ankles, legs, and feet may be a manifestation of right ventricular hypertrophy. Severe enlargement of the right venticule can cause shortness of breath and chest pain. Along with discovering an enlarged heart, a chest x-ray can expose other conditions that may have lead to the enlargement.\n[18] Untreated, RVH can lead to a weakened heart or even heart failure. When the muscle thickens around one of the hearts lower chambers, it is a condition known as ventricular hypertrophy. The thicker heart muscle loses elasticity over time, causing the heart to work harder to effectively pump blood to the lungs, brain and the rest of the body.\n[19] Ventricular hypertrophy. Ventricular hypertrophy (VH) is thickening of the walls of a ventricle (lower chamber) of the heart.[1][2] Although left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is more common, right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), as well as concurrent hypertrophy of both ventricles can also occur.\n[20] Right ventricular hypertrophy is a form of ventricular hypertrophy affecting the right ventricle. Blood travels through the right ventricle to the lungs via the pulmonary arteries. If conditions occur which decrease pulmonary circulation, meaning blood does not flow well from the heart to the lungs, extra stress can be placed on the right ventricle. This can lead to right ventricular hypertrophy. It can affect electrocardiography findings.

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) means that the muscle of the left pumping chamber of the heart (left ventricle) is thickened. The left ventricle's job is to pump blood to the body, and conditions that increase the work the left ventricle has to do can lead to thickening of the muscle.\n[17] The chronic exposure to fluid overload and hypertension may lead to cardiac stiffness and left ventricular hypertrophy; some studies have reported an increased risk of death due to inadequate total body fluid removal. Therefore, fluid management should be based on accurate estimation of patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 dialysis needs.\n[18] From here, the blood enters the left side of the heart from where it is pumped all round your body. Because the left side of the heart has to work harder to get blood round your body, it is usually this side that becomes enlarged when your blood pressure is too high. This is sometimes called left ventricular hypertrophy or LVH for short. In other words, it is another name for an enlarged heart.\n[19] Heart-Healthy Living.

Ventricular hypertrophy can be part of various syndromes caused by any of various underlying diseases.\n[12] In the other types, the muscular left ventricle becomes very thick. High blood pressure may cause your left ventricle to enlarge (a type known as hypertrophy). The thickening (which doctors call hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) can also be inherited. An enlarged heart keeps more of its pumping ability when it's thick rather than thin. Causes\n[13] What is left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)? The right and left sides of your heart do different jobs. The right side takes in blood that has travelled round the body and pumps it to the lungs. From here, the blood enters the left side of the heart from where it is pumped all round your body. Because the left side of the heart has to work harder to get blood round your body, it is usually this side that becomes enlarged when your blood pressure is too high. This is sometimes called left ventricular hypertrophy or LVH for short. In other words, it is another name for an enlarged heart. People with high blood pressure and an enlarged left side of the heart have four times the risk of a heart attack than someone with the same blood pressure but a normal-sized heart.\n[14] What is Left Ventricular Hypertrophy? Left ventricular hypertrophy is a disorder of the heart involving the enlargement or thickening of the wall of cardiac muscle situated in the chamber of the heart known as the left ventricle.\n[15] Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a condition in which the muscle wall of heart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s left pumping chamber (ventricle) becomes thickened (hypertrophy).

Hypertension is the most common cause, setting the stage for left ventricular hypertrophy once a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blood pressure exceeds the normal level of 140/90 mm Hg. Aside from hypertension, the condition known as aortic valve stenosis is also a common cause of the hypertrophic changes in the heart.\n[2] Over time, this can cause the heart muscle to thicken. As the heart pumps against elevated pressure in the blood vessels, the left ventricle becomes enlarged and the amount of blood pumped by the heart each minute (cardiac output) goes down, a condition called left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Without treatment, this can lead to heart failure.\n[3] Left ventricular hypertrophy can occur as an inborn disease in infants and children, due to an underlying condition known as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or HCM is a hereditary disease that involves an inborn abnormality of the cardiac muscles.\n[4] Factors that can cause your heart to work harder include: 1 High blood pressure (hypertension). This is the most common cause of left ventricular hypertrophy. More than one-third of people show evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy at the time of their diagnosis with hypertension. Aortic valve stenosis.\n[5] Left Ventricular Hypertrophy. Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH) causes a similar pattern of repolarization abnormalities as LBBB, with ST elevation in the leads with deep S-waves (usually V1-3) and ST depression/T-wave inversion in the leads with tall R waves (I, aVL, V5-6).\n[6] Patients who present with a thickened left ventricle are likely suffering from left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). There are a few different causes of LVH. It is a strong indicator of potential coronary complications, and there is a strong correlation between certain types of LVH and morbidity and mortality.\n[7] High blood pressure may also bring on heart failure by causing left ventricular hypertrophy, a thickening of the heart muscle that results in less effective muscle relaxation between heart beats. This makes it difficult for the heart to fill with enough blood to supply the body\u00e2\u0080\u0099s organs, especially during exercise, leading your body to hold onto fluids and your heart rate to increase.\n[8] Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is serious when the muscle is very thick (max thickness >3 cm), or if the increased muscle mass is impeding blood flow through the heart (defined as increased outflow pressure gradient).\n[9] Left ventricular hypertrophy that is caused by aortic valve stenosis might require surgery to repair the narrow valve or to replace it with an artificial or tissue valve. 1 Tests and diagnosis. 2 Lifestyle and home remedies.\n[10] Left ventricular hypertrophy that is caused by aortic valve stenosis might require surgery to repair the narrow valve or to replace it with an artificial or tissue valve.

Aortic valve stenosis.\n[3] Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) occurs when the muscle tissue in the heart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main pumping chamber becomes enlarged. LVH is often caused by high blood pressure or other heart problems and can lead to serious complications, such as heart disease, heart attack and heart failure.\n[4] Left ventricular hypertrophy is a thickening of the wall of the heart's main pumping chamber. This thickening may result in elevation of pressure within the heart and sometimes poor pumping action. The most common cause is high blood pressure.\n[5] Left ventricular hypertrophy may cause or facilitate many cardiac complications of hypertension, including congestive heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and sudden death. Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, which may present with all of the symptoms and signs of congestive heart failure, is common in patients with long-standing hypertension.\n[6] Left ventricular hypertrophy is enlargement and thickening (hypertrophy) of the walls of your heart's main pumping chamber (left ventricle). Left ventricular hypertrophy can develop in response to some factor \u00e2\u0080\u0094 such as high blood pressure or a heart condition \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that causes the left ventricle to work harder.

This is most commonly the result of longstanding high blood pressure which has caused secondary damage to the wall of the main pumping chamber of the heart, the left ventricle.\n[9] Chamber Hypertrophy and Enlargment. In hypertrophy the heart muscle becomes thicker. This can have different causes. Left ventricular hypertrophy results from an increase in left ventricular workload, e.g., during hypertension or aortic valve stenosis. Right ventricular hypertrophy results from an increase in right ventricular workload, e.g., emphysema or pulmonary embolization. These causes are fundamentally different from hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HCM), which is a congenital misalignment of cardiomyocytes, resulting in hypertrophy.\n[10] See the Mayo Clinic webpage Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the thickening of the muscle of the left ventricle, usually because pumping against a higher resistance (hypertension, aortic valve defects) or as part of a hereditary heart muscle disease (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy).

Clinical surveillance \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or syndromic surveillance \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is the surveillance (collection and analysis) of health data about a clinical syndrome that has a significant impact on public health, which is then used to drive decisions about health policy and health education.\n[7] Analysis Services provides three data providers for server and data access. All applications connecting to Analysis Services do so using one of these providers. Two of the providers, ADOMD.NET and Analysis Services Management Objects (AMO), are managed data providers.\n[8] (e) management of the BSA/AML program by a qualified compliance officer, who is supported by adequate staffing levels and resources, and who is responsible for. overseeing and monitoring compliance by the New York Branch with all applicable BSA/AML. requirements and the institution\u00e2\u0080\u0099s internal policies and procedures.\n[9] 1 Adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes abnormal myeloblasts (a type of white blood cell), red blood cells, or platelets.2 Leukemia may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. 3 There are different subtypes of AML.he extent or spread of cancer is usually described as stages. In adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the subtype of AML and whether the leukemia has spread outside the blood and bone marrow are used instead of the stage to plan treatment.\n[10] 1 Surveillance (or production) engineering, i.e. monitoring of existing fields and optimization of production and injection rates. 2 Surveillance engineers typically use analytical and empirical techniques to perform their work, including decline curve analysis, material balance modeling, and inflow/outflow analysis.\n[11] Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is also called acute myelogenous leukemia. It is a fast-growing cancer of the bone marrow and blood cells. Cells that should become white blood cells (WBCs) do not fully grow. These cells are called myeloblasts and monoblasts.\n[12] acute myelogenous leukemia (AML): a type of leukemia, or cancer of the blood and blood-forming tissue, where many abnormal granulocytes (a type of white blood cell) are produced by the body. allogeneic transplantation: a procedure where cells, tissue, or organs are transplanted to a person from a compatible donor.\n[13] AML results from the clonal expansion of myeloid blasts in the peripheral blood, bone marrow or other tissue. It is caused when either the myeloid stem cells produce abnormal myeloblasts which do not become healthy white blood cells or too many myeloid stem cells become abnormal red blood cells or platelets.\n[14] AM is amplitude modulation. AM detection is the process of demodulation or recovering the information encoded in the signal through amplitude modulation. AM detection can be d\u00e2\u0080\u00a6one through a simple diode detector which rectifies the AM signal. 1 person found this useful.\n[15] Under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), MSBs must establish an AML program which sets forth at a minimum: internal policies, procedures, and controls; designates a compliance officer; provides for ongoing employee training; and provides for an independent audit function to test programs. 31 U.S.C. Section 5318(h).\n[16] Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults, 45% of all leukemias and 80-90% of acute leukemias. The seven major types of acute nonlymphoid or myeloid leukemia are: Acute nonlymphocytic (ANLL.\n[17] Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one of the most common types of leukemia among adults.

This course will provide you with the information you need to detect adversarial surveillance and to report it.\n[20] In immunohistochemistry tests, cells from the blood or bone marrow samples are also treated with special antibodies. But instead of using a laser and computer, the sample is treated so that certain types of cells change color when seen under a microscope. lumbar puncture is not often used to test for AML, unless the patient is having symptoms that could be caused by leukemia cells spreading into the brain and spinal cord. For this test, the patient may lie on his side or sit up. The doctor first numbs an area of skin on the lower part of the back over the spine.\nSearch Query: what is an aml surveillance analyst.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

An integral part of the human airway, the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli together make up the lower respiratory tract [2, 3].\n[6] Trachea and esophagus are two different organs present in almost every animal. The basic difference between esophagus and trachea is that the former forms part of the digestive system of a living organism whereas the latter is a part of the respiratory system.Being parts of different systems, both trachea and esophagus perform different functions.nother important difference between trachea and esophagus can be seen in their blood supplies. The former gets its blood supply from the lower thyroid arteries while the arteries in the thorax and abdominal region supply blood to the latter.\n[7] Cricoid Cartilage.

It is longer than a vessel element and has no perforation plates. Tracheids are elongated cells in the xylem of vascular plants that serve in the transport of water and mineral salts.Tracheids are one of two types of tracheary elements, vessel elements being the other. Tracheids, unlike vessel elements, do not have perforation plates.racheids provide most of the structural support in softwoods, where they are the major cell type. Because tracheids have a much higher surface to volume ratio compared to vessel elements, they serve to hold water against gravity (by adhesion) when transpiration is not occurring.\n[5] Its major components include xylem parenchyma, xylem fibers, tracheids, and xylem vessels. Tracheids are one of the two types of tracheary elements of vascular plants. (The other being the vessel elements). A tracheid cell loses its protoplast at maturity.

It is a measure of the revenue generated by one customer phone, pager, etc., per unit time, typically per year or month. related measure is ARPDAU (Average Revenue Per Daily Active User) and a less used measure of AMPU, or average margin per user. ARPU is widely used by Internet Protocol television (IPTV) service providers.\n[5] Definition of margin for English Language Learners. : 1 the part of a page that is above, below, or to the side of the printed part. : 2 the place where something (such as a piece of land) stops : the edge of something. : 3 an extra amount of something (such as time or space) that can be used if it is needed.\n[6] This region is also where the active Hellenic margin is located, which joins the Ionian Islands to Western Anatolia (Innocenti et al., 2010). The central part of the plate is characterized by the Plio-Quaternary volcanic arc and the Pindos ophiolites (Innocenti et al., 2010).The northern extensional basins form the boundary between the Aegean microplate and the Eurasian plate (Innocenti et al., 2010).his region is also where the active Hellenic margin is located, which joins the Ionian Islands to Western Anatolia (Innocenti et al., 2010).

Active management is the use of a human element, such as a single manager, co-managers or a team of managers, to actively manage a fund's portfolio. Active managers rely on analytical research, forecasts, and their own judgment and experience in making investment decisions on what securities to buy, hold and sell. The opposite of active management is passive management, better known as indexing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n[8] The once quiet, Appalachian passive margin changed to a very active plate boundary when a neighboring oceanic plate, the Iapetus, collided with and began sinking beneath the North American craton. With the birth of this new subduction zone, the early Appalachians were born.\n[9] Definition of margin. 1 1 : the part of a page or sheet outside the main body of printed or written matter. 2 2 : the outside limit and adjoining surface of something : edge at the margin of the woods continental margin.\n[10] First meaning: Margins in business commerce. As a general term in business and commerce, margin refers to the difference between selling price and the seller's costs for the goods or services being sold, expressed as a percentage of selling price.\n[11] is an actual plate boundary, where oceanic crust and continental crust crash into each other. Active plate margins are often the site of earthquakes and volcanoes. Oceanic crust created by seafloor spreading in the East Pacific Rise, for instance, may become part of the Ring of Fire, the horseshoe-shaped pattern of volcanoes and earthquake\n[12] 1 An oceanic trench forms offshore, and a chain of volcanic mountains forms just inland of the coast. 2 This type of boundary between oceanic crust and continental crust is called an active continental margin since it is a plate boundary. 3 At other convergent boundaries, oceanic plate meets other oceanic plate.\n[13] This type of passive margin develops where rifting is oblique to the coastline, as is now occurring in the Gulf of California. Nature of transitional crust Transitional crust, separating true oceanic and continental crusts, is the foundation of any passive margin.\n[14] Mantle plumes and hotspots. Not all volcanic activity can be related to present day active plate margins. The Pacific Ocean shows a number of sub-parallel chains of volcanic islands which run diagonally across the Pacific plate (see map below).\n[15] What is a 'Margin Account'. A margin account is a brokerage account in which the broker lends the customer cash to purchase securities. The loan in the account is collateralized by the securities and cash. Because the customer is investing with a broker's money rather than his own, the customer is using leverage to magnify both gains and losses.\n[16] DEFINITION of 'Margin Account'. A brokerage account in which the broker lends the customer cash to purchase securities. The loan in the account is collateralized by the securities and cash.\n[17] A Margin is a procedure allowing investors to borrow against their existing holdings to buy more securities. Usually the loan value is 100% of the account value. Thus the margin requirement, the amount needed in the account to keep it open is 50% of the value. In other words one can buy $20,000 worth of stock for $10,000.\n[18] To margin, also called buying on margin, refers to the practice of buying an asset where the buyer pays only a percentage of the asset's value and borrows the rest from the bank or broker. The broker acts as a lender, and he uses the funds in the securities account as collateral on the loan's balance.\n[19] Third meaning: Margins in investing. As an investment term, margin refers to buying shares of stock or other securities with a combination of the investor's own funds and borrowed funds. If the stock price changes between its purchase and sale, the result for the investor is leverage.\n[20] Margin in business. As a general term in business and commerce, the term margin refers to the difference between selling price and the seller's costs for the goods or services being sold, expressed as a percentage of selling price.\nSearch Query: what is a active margin.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

An active continental margin is found on the leading edge of the continent where it is crashing into an oceanic plate. An excellent example is the west coast of South America. Active margins are commonly the sites of tectonic activity: earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain building, and the formation of new igneous rock.\n[2] Active continental margins, i.e., when an oceanic plate subducts beneath a continent, represent about two-thirds of the modern convergent margins. Their cumulated length has been estimated to 45,000 km (Lallemand et al.,\n[3] Two types of continental margins exist: active margins and passive margins. Active margins form primarily along the boundaries of plates that are actively converging. Passive margins currently exist in the middle of plates, not at plate boundaries.\n[4] Active continental margins form primarily along the boundaries of plates that are actively converging and where one plate is sinking beneath the other.

As you probably know the theory of plate tectonics posits the outer layer of the Earth consist of plates which move relative to each other driven by convection in the Mantle.\n[2] Active continental margin: A continental margin that has a very narrow, or even nonexistent, continental shelf and a narrow and steep continental slope that ends in a deep trench instead of a continental rise; it is marked by earthquake and volcanic activity.\n[3] An active continental margin refers to the submerged edge of a continent overriding an oceanic lithosphere at a convergent plate boundary by opposition with a passive continental margin which is the remaining scar at the edge of a continent following continental break-up.\n[4] Active Margins. occur where oceanic lithosphere is being subducted beneath the edge of the continent. the result is a relatively narrow margin that consists of highly deformed sediment that was scraped from the decending lithospheric slab and plastered against the margin of the overriding continent.\n[5] An active plate margin is an actual plate boundary, where oceanic crust and continental crust crash into each other. Active plate margins are often the site of earthquakes and volcanoes. Oceanic crust created by seafloor spreading in the East Pacific Rise, for instance, may become part of the Ring of Fire, the horseshoe-shaped pattern of volcanoes and earthquake zones around the Pacific ocean basin.\n[6] Passive margin. A passive margin is the transition between oceanic and continental lithosphere that is not an active plate margin. A passive margin forms by sedimentation above an ancient rift, now marked by transitional lithosphere. Continental rifting creates new ocean basins.\n[7] An active continental margin is found on the leading edge of the continent where it is crashing into an oceanic plate. An excellent example is the west coast of South America. Active margins are commonly the sites of tectonic activity: earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain building, and the formation of new igneous rock.\n[8] The continental margins along India and Antarctica are other examples of passive margins. A continental margin that has a very narrow, or even nonexistent, continental shelf and a narrow and steep continental slope is known as an active continental margin. Instead of ending in a continental rise, the continental slope of this type of margin often plunges into a deep-ocean trench, which may be filled with sediment.\n[9] Active Margins. occur where oceanic lithosphere is being subducted beneath the edge of the continent. the result is a relatively narrow margin that consists of highly deformed sediment that was scraped from the decending lithospheric slab and plastered against the margin of the overriding continent.ame thing as oceanic ridge. Long well developed divergent plate boundary, sea floor is elevated forming a broad line swell called the ocean ridge. knowledge of the ridge comes from soundings of the ocean floor and floor samples from deep sea drilling, visual inspections from deep submersibles.\n[10] Making the world better, one answer at a time. Passive continental margins are not areas of convergence. There is little volcanic and earthquake activity on passive margins. Active margins are areas of convergence where one plate is descending beneath another. They are associated with volcanic and earthquake activity.\n[11] The overall rate may be extremely slow (one to ten centimeters per year), but the long term effect is a continual re-shaping of the surface of our planet. An active continental margin is found on the leading edge of the continent where it is crashing into an oceanic plate. An excellent example is the west coast of South America. Active margins are commonly the sites of tectonic activity: earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain building, and the formation of new igneous rock.\n[12] Active continental margins, i.e., when an oceanic plate subducts beneath a continent, represent about two-thirds of the modern convergent margins. Their cumulated length has been estimated to 45,000 km (Lallemand et al.,\n[13] Two types of continental margins exist: active margins and passive margins. Active margins form primarily along the boundaries of plates that are actively converging. Passive margins currently exist in the middle of plates, not at plate boundaries.\n[14] Active continental margins form primarily along the boundaries of plates that are actively converging and where one plate is sinking beneath the other. Active margins mark the continents that border the Pacific Ocean where oceanic plates are subducting beneath continental plates.assive continental margin: A continental margin that has a broad continental shelf, a gentle continental slope, and a pronounced continental rise; it is marked by a lack of earthquake and volcanic activity. Plates: Large sections of Earth's lithosphere separated by deep fault zones.\n[15] best answer an active continental margin is found on the leading edge of the continent where it is crashing into an oceanic platean excellent example is the west coast of south americaactive margins are commonly the sites of tectonic activity earthquakes volcanoes mountain building and the formation of new igneous rockn excellent example is the west coast of south america active margins are commonly the sites of tectonic activity earthquakes volcanoes mountain building and the formation of new igneous rock\n[16] A continental margin that has a broad continental shelf, a gentle continental slope, and a pronounced continental rise is known as a passive continental margin. This type of margin experiences little, if any, volcanic or earthquake activity. The build-up of sediment is the primary activity affecting a passive margin.\n[17] Passive plate margins endure very little constructive or destructive movement. Active plate margins describe subduction zones and other boundaries where movement is regular and common. Cause of earthquakes.\n[18] Both passive and active continental margins are located near coastlines. The main difference is that active margins are the main sites where tectonic activity takes place (lik \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 e earthquakes). This is because the continental shelf of active continental margins collide with an oceanic plate, creating subduction.\n[19] rating newest oldest best answer an active continental margin is found on the leading edge of the continent where it is crashing into an oceanic plate an excellent example is the west coast of south americaactive margins are commonly the sites of tectonic activity earthquakes volcanoes mountain building and the formation of new igneous rockn excellent example is the west coast of south america active margins are commonly the sites of tectonic activity earthquakes volcanoes mountain building and the formation of new igneous rock\n[20] Passive continental margin: A continental margin that has a broad continental shelf, a gentle continental slope, and a pronounced continental rise; it is marked by a lack of earthquake and volcanic activity.

FDA-cleared, non-invasive and clinically proven to reduce fat through patented cooling technology, Pittsburgh CoolSculpting has revolutionized the body sculpting industry. Body sculpting with CoolSculpting requires no surgery, little-to-no downtime and undeniable results.\n[6] With conventional tillage (complete turning over of the soil), the bare soil is exposed to the erosive action of water, which, in many areas is the major route of soil loss. Under conservation tillage, the crop residue buffers the raindrops' energy, so water has less erosive force when it reaches the soil.onservation tillage is basically any system of cultivating that reduces soil or water loss when compared to conventional moldboard plowing, which turns over the soil completely.\n[7] contour length measurements to be 17.8, 17.4, and 13.9 kb, respectively. repeats comprising 41 to 91% of the mass of plasmids. repeats were joined at one end and separated at the other by a unique sequence (US,). annealed molecules of the recombinant plasmid pDB201.\n[8] Reducer fittings, bronze threaded (left) and copper sweat (right) A reducer is the component in a pipeline that reduces the pipe size from a larger to a smaller bore (inner diameter).

This happens naturally over longer periods of time. By plowing you are in effect mining the soil of its nutrients. The organic matter that breaks down the easiest is the first to be mined/oxidized. Think of it like a fire. Plowing adds oxygen to the soil making the fire burn hotter releasing most of the nitrogen to the air and some to the plants. IT DOES NOT ADD NITROGEN TO THE SOIL. That nitrogen was already there in a stable state to be used later. Now you lost much of it to denitrification (the air).\n[3] Botox\u00c2\u00ae Jaw line Contouring / Face Slimming. Botox\u00c2\u00ae injection can improve an individual's appearance in many ways, like reducing wrinkles and creases in the skin, but what many people do not know is that it can also be used for facial contouring.\n[4] Persistent herbicides present in this concentrated zone may affect shallow-planted susceptible crops. If a potential herbicide carryover problem exists and soil erosion is not a concern, moldboard plowing, in particular, can help dilute the pesticide.\n[5] In general, the key to minimizing soil erosion is to avoid leaving the soil surface devoid of vegetation. The time that the soil is typically bare, and thus most susceptible to erosion, is after plowing to prepare a seedbed.\n[6] Measurement of limb occlusion pressure can help to minimize tourniquet pressure levels and pressure gradients for individual patients and individual surgical procedures. Selective use of pneumatic, wider, and contoured tourniquet cuffs reduces tourniquet pressure levels and the applied pressure gradients.\n[7] Body contouring without surgery, needles, or any pain.

The proper combination of such farming methods can be determined by various climatic and soil conditions of that given area.\n[12] 2. Use terrace farming. This type of farming uses the topography of the land to slow water flow through a series of terraces. This manipulation of the water flow prevents it from gathering speed and washing soil away from farmlands. 3. Practice contour farming. Contour farming replicates the effects of terrace farming, but on a smaller scale.\n[13] In general, the key to minimizing soil erosion is to avoid leaving the soil surface devoid of vegetation. The time that the soil is typically bare, and thus most susceptible to erosion, is after plowing to prepare a seedbed.\n[14] With conventional tillage (complete turning over of the soil), the bare soil is exposed to the erosive action of water, which, in many areas is the major route of soil loss. Under conservation tillage, the crop residue buffers the raindrops' energy, so water has less erosive force when it reaches the soil.onservation tillage is basically any system of cultivating that reduces soil or water loss when compared to conventional moldboard plowing, which turns over the soil completely.\n[15] Ploughing the soil only releases nitrogen that was already present in an unavailable form. This happens naturally over longer periods of time. By plowing you are in effect mining the soil of its nutrients. The organic matter that breaks down the easiest is the first to be mined/oxidized.

Contour plowing (or contour ploughing) or contour farming is the farming practice of plowing across a slope following its elevation contour lines. The rows form slow water run-off during rainstorms to prevent soil erosion and allow the water time to settle into the soil.\n[3] 1. They plant shelter belts of trees to break the force of the wind 2. In dry areas, instead of plowing under the natural vegetation to plant crops, farmers graze animals on the vegetation 3. On gentle slopes, plowing along the natural contours of the land or planting crops in strips helps reduce water erosion 4.\n[4] Definition of contour plowing in US English - plowing along the contours of the land in order to minimize soil erosion. Definition of contour plowing in US English - plowing along the contours of the land in order to minimize soil erosion.\n[5] One of the earliest methods of conservation tillage came to be known as contour plowing, or plowing on the contour. Tilling the soil along the gentle slopes of a piece of cropland, instead of up and down the gradient, prevents fertile topsoil from being carried downhill by flowing rainwater.\n[6] Farmers can reduce soil erosion by___. A. increasing irrigation.. . B. contour plowing.. . C. grazing cattle on the land.. . D. plowing up roots. - 1851268\n[7] In contour ploughing, the ruts made by the plow run perpendicular rather than parallel to slopes, generally resulting in furrows that curve around the land and are level. This method is also known for preventing tillage erosion. Tillage erosion is the soil movement and erosion by tilling a given plot of land. A similar practice is contour bunding where stones are placed around the contours of slopes.\n[8] Contour plowing is also promoted in countries with similar rainfall patterns to the United States such as western Canada and Australia. The practice is effective only on slopes with between 2% and 10% gradient and when rainfall does not exceed a certain amount within a certain period.\n[9] Definitions for Contour plowing. Contour plowing. Contour ploughing or contour farming is the farming practice of ploughing and/or planting across a slope following its elevation contour lines.\n[10] Safeopedia explains Contour Plowing. Contour farming is done in hilly and sloped areas. Farmers who practice contour farming start by cutting levels into the hill or contoured area. This creates a series of steps on the hill on which crops are grown.\n[11] Contour Plowing & Terraces The Soil Erosion Service was one of the federal programs started in the 1930s to save the land that had been destroyed by years of wind erosion, over plowing, and over grazing.

For prevention of rain-driven erosion, it is important to anchor the dirt down, such as with grass, or prevent water from collecting and picking up dirt as it flows down slope. A common way to prevent this is contour ploughing. What is... Making slopes into steps so that rain cannot run down a hill carrying soil off. When building terraces, it is important to stabilize the slope. -The easiest way to do this is to plant grass. If there is enough rock around it may be possible to construct a wall out of them. Contour Ploughing- Similar to terracing, except that it follows the contours of a hill more closely than terracing, possibly even encircling a hill top The contours are not wide like terraces.\n[20] Plowing and planting across the changing slope of land, rather than in straight lines, to help retain water and reduce soil erosion. Method for reducing soil erosion; plant stalks are left in the field after harvesting and the next year's crop is planted within the stalks without plowing.\nSearch Query: what can contour plowing reduce.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

This will also reduce soil erosion and make rainwater infiltrate into the soil more than on land plowed along the slope. Terraces are more effective than contour plowing alone in minimizing soil erosion and facilitating infiltration f rainfall into the soil.\n[2] 2016-09-28T08:13:26-04:00. Farmers can reduce soil erosion by contour plowing. The correct option among all the options that are given in the question is the second option or option B. The other choices given in the question are incorrect and can be neglected. I hope that this is the answer that has actually come to your desired help.\n[3] Contour plowing is the act of farming on a hill or a contoured area. The plow follows the contours of the land horizontally helping to reduce runoff of water. This practice helps to prevent soil erosion in hilly and contoured areas by capturing the water runoff using water breaks to keep water contained. Contour plowing is also known as contour farming, and is a sustainable form of agriculture.\n[4] Both contour plowing and terrace farming are suitable for cultivating lands on sloping hills. Both are used to reduce soil erosion from tilled fields on slopes. In terrace farming, physical barriers (trenches, stone bunds, live hedges, or natural strips) are created along the contours to retain rain water and make it infiltrate into the soil and to minimize soil erosion.\n[5] A: Contour plowing conserves soil by following the lay of the land and creating ridges that form a water break to prevent soil erosion. Furrows that do not follow the lay of the land cause rapid runoff during rainfall by forming a convenient channel for the water to flow downhill.\n[6] Contour plowing Contour ploughing or contour farming is the farming practice of ploughing and/or planting across a slope following its elevation contour lines. These contour lines create a water break which reduces the formation of rills and gullies during times of heavy water run-off; which is a major cause of top soil loss and soil erosion.\n[7] Contour plowing.

These contour lines create a water break which reduces the formation of rills and gullies during times of heavy water run-off; which is a major cause of soil erosion.\n[9] Contour plowing was a method of plowing furrows that follow the curves of the land rather than straight up and down slopes. Furrows that run up and down a slope form a channel that can quickly carry away seeds and topsoil. Contour plowing forms ridges, slows the water flow and helps save precious topsoil. LeRoy Hoffman rented farmland for his entire farming career and remembers when the government urged farmers to change their plowing methods.\n[10] Tilling the field at right angles to the natural slope after drawing up the elevation contour lines is called contour ploughing in soil, prevents and reduces soil erosion. Terrace Farming In terracing, wide steps are cut around the slopes of hills to prevent soil erosion.\n[11] Tilling the field at right angles to the natural slope after drawing up the elevation contour lines is called contour ploughing in soil, prevents and reduces soil erosion. Terrace Farming In terracing, wide steps are cut around the slopes of hills to prevent soil erosion. Contour ploughing follows the \u00e2\u0080\u009cnatural shape\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the slope without altering it. Terrace farming alters the shape of the slope to produce flat areas that provide a catchment for water.\n[12] Contour bunding, Catalonia, 2007. Contour plowing (or contour ploughing) or contour farming is the farming practice of plowing across a slope following its elevation contour lines. The rows form slow water run-off during rainstorms to prevent soil erosion and allow the water time to settle into the soil.\n[13] One of the earliest methods of conservation tillage came to be known as contour plowing, or plowing on the contour. Tilling the soil along the gentle slopes of a piece of cropland, instead of up and down the gradient, prevents fertile topsoil from being carried downhill by flowing rainwater.\n[14] In contour ploughing, the ruts made by the plow run perpendicular rather than parallel to slopes, generally resulting in furrows that curve around the land and are level. This method is also known for preventing tillage erosion. Tillage erosion is the soil movement and erosion by tilling a given plot of land. A similar practice is contour bunding where stones are placed around the contours of slopes.\n[15] Contour plowing is also promoted in countries with similar rainfall patterns to the United States such as western Canada and Australia. The practice is effective only on slopes with between 2% and 10% gradient and when rainfall does not exceed a certain amount within a certain period.\n[16] Definitions for Contour plowing.

Bangkok has a population of official 8.3 million inhabitants (2010 census), an estimated 10 million people live in Bangkok's metropolitan sprawling area.Bangkok is the cultural and political center of the coumtry and the seat of the Kingdom of Thailand. Official language is Thai; English in use but proficiency is low.n the north-eastern corner of the complex there is Wat Phra Keo, the Chapel Royal of the Emerald Buddha, the most sacred Buddhist temple (wat) in Thailand. The Map shows a city map of Bangkok with expressways, main roads and streets.\n[4] The population of Thailand is about 69,122,234 (2010 estimate). This represents an overall population density of about 114 persons per sq km (about 294 per sq mi).

The oldest known mention of their existence in the region by the exonym Siamese is in a 12th-century inscription at the Khmer temple complex of Angkor Wat in Cambodia, which refers to syam, or dark brown, people.

That is, food often becomes the social occasion in itself, or reason to celebrate. This is partly due to the friendly, social nature of Thai people, but also because of the way in which food is ordered and eaten in Thailand.he formal presentation of food is another important aspect of Thai culture. Developed primarily in the palace to please the King of Siam, Thai food presentation is among the most exquisite in the world.\n[15] Thai cuisine is essentially a marriage of centuries-old Eastern and Western influences harmoniously combined into something uniquely Thai.

It was the American entry into the war that ended up proving to be decisive and would end up defining victory for the Allies.\n[20] So, what did all this have to do with America and why did we enter World War One? Most Americans favored staying out of the conflict and President Wilson publicly and formally stated that the United States would follow a policy of neutrality. In three short years, however, the United States would find itself in the middle of what later became known as the first World War.

Since the Russians decided to quit the war, the Germans were able to move many of their troops from the eastern front to the stalemate in the West.\n[7] The US did not enter the war when the German blitzkrieg took most of Western Europe. It did not enter the war when Germany started to bomb England.

Since this was done by a U.S. Government funded and supervised organization, these carried the weight of official pronouncements.\n[11] The United States did not enter the conflict until April 1917, but its entry was the decisive event of the war, enabling the Allies (Great Britain, France, Italy, and Russia) to defeat the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Turkey, and Bulgaria).he western front was in France, where Germany was opposed by France, Great Britain, and eventually the United States.

It is caused by compression in and around the organs, or by stretching of the abdominal cavity.
