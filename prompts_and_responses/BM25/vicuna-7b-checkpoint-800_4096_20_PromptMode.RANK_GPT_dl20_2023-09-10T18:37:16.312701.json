Acetyl-L-Carnitine is an amino acid the body uses to turn fat into energy. It is not normally considered an essential nutrient because the body can manufacture all it needs. However, supplemental Carnitine may improve the ability of certain tissues to produce energy.\n[2] Acetyl-L-carnitine is an amino acid (a building block for proteins) that is naturally produced in the body. It helps the body produce energy.Acetyl-L-carnitine is used for a variety of mental disorders including Alzheimer's disease, age-related memory loss, late-life depression, thinking problems related to alcoholism, and thinking problems related to Lyme disease.cetyl-L-carnitine is an amino acid (a building block for proteins) that is naturally produced in the body. It helps the body produce energy.\n[3] But before I get into the details of this flawed study, let's first take a closer look at carnitine and what it does in your body. The Transporter. L-carnitine, or just carnitine (the L refers to the configuration of the carnitine molecule that is biologically active) is often referred to as an amino acid, but it is not a true amino acid. Carnitine is an amino acid-like compound that is made in the body from the amino acids lysine and methionine. Its name is derived from the Greek word for flesh or meat, carnus. Not so coincidentally, it's abundant in red meat and dairy products, but it can also be found in various nuts, grains, and green vegetables.\n[4] Acetyl L Carnitine is one of the more common formulations of L-Carnitine, which is itself an amino acid that is produced from two other amino acids (Lysine and Methionine). This version, or form, of L-Carnitine is significant more active than it parent compound due to a higher degree of bioavailability.\n[5] L-carnitine is synthesized in the body from the amino acids lysine and methionine. Learn how your chances of success can increase with this in your arsenal. L-carnitine is synthesized in the body from the amino acids lysine and methionine.Regardless of what your bodybuilding and fitness goals are, losing fat or gaining muscle, your chances of success will increase greatly if you have l-carnitine in your supplement arsenal.-carnitine is synthesized in the body from the amino acids lysine and methionine. Learn how your chances of success can increase with this in your arsenal. L-carnitine is synthesized in the body from the amino acids lysine and methionine.\n[6] Carnitine: What is it? Carnitine, derived from an amino acid, is found in nearly all cells of the body. Its name is derived from the Latin carnus or flesh, as the compound was isolated from meat. Carnitine is the generic term for a number of compounds that include L-carnitine, acetyl-L-carnitine, and propionyl-L-carnitine [1,2].\n[7] Some of the foods that can produce bad odor in both kids and adults are: 1 Red meat has an amino acid derivative called carnitine. Too much of carnitine can create a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfishy\u00e2\u0080\u009d body odor (1). 2 Pasteurized and packaged milk is usually contaminated by hormones in the cow. It also contains carnitine.\n[8] Nutrients for L-carnitine Production. Niacin, vitamin B-6 and iron increase metabolism by assisting with the production of L-carnitine, an amino acid that promotes fat burning, notes Vanderbilt University.Your body synthesizes L-carnitine from the essential amino acids lysine and methionine in the liver.utrients for L-carnitine Production. Niacin, vitamin B-6 and iron increase metabolism by assisting with the production of L-carnitine, an amino acid that promotes fat burning, notes Vanderbilt University.\n[9] Where it comes from: Carnitine (and L-carnitine) is a nutrient that helps the body break down fat and turn it into energy. It also increases the activity of certain nerve cells in the central nervous system. Carnitine is an amino acid naturally produced by the body in the liver and kidneys and stored in the skeletal muscles, heart, brain and sperm. The nutrient also occurs in fish, poultry, red meat and some types of dairy.\n[10] Carnitine, derived from an amino acid, is found in nearly all cells of the body. Its name is derived from the Latin carnus or flesh, as the compound was isolated from meat.Carnitine is the generic term for a number of compounds that include L-carnitine, acetyl-L-carnitine, and propionyl-L-carnitine [ 1-2 ].arnitine plays a critical role in energy production.

It is considered a vitamin-like and amino acid-like compound that is related to the B vitamins. When it was first studied back in the 1950s, L-carnitine was referred to as vitamin BT. L-carnitine is formed in the liver and kidneys from the amino acids lysine and methionine. However, it is stored elsewhere in the body, primarily in muscle (including the heart), the brain, and even in sperm. In the diet, it mainly comes from meat and other animal products.\n[13] Background. Carnitine is a naturally occurring hydrophilic amino acid derivative, produced endogenously in the kidneys and liver and derived from meat and dairy products in the diet.It plays an essential role in the transfer of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation.arnitine deficiency is a metabolic state in which carnitine concentrations in plasma and tissues are less than the levels required for normal function of the organism. Biologic effects of low carnitine levels may not be clinically significant until they reach less than 10-20% of normal.\n[14] Carnitine biosynthesis and metabolism. Carnitine, a branched non-essential amino acid, is synthesized from the essential amino acids lysine and methionine. Ascorbic acid, ferrous iron, pyroxidine and niacin are also necessary cofactors [1] and deficiencies of any of these can lead to carnitine deficiency.\n[15] Nutrients for L-carnitine Production. Niacin, vitamin B-6 and iron increase metabolism by assisting with the production of L-carnitine, an amino acid that promotes fat burning, notes Vanderbilt University. Your body synthesizes L-carnitine from the essential amino acids lysine and methionine in the liver.\n[16] The body can convert L-carnitine to other amino acids called acetyl-L-carnitine and propionyl-L-carnitine. But, no one knows whether the benefits of carnitines are interchangeable. Until more is known, don't substitute one form of carnitine for another.\n[17] Carnitine is primarily used for heart-related conditions.

Cuboidal epithelia are found inside the kidneys, in parts of the eye and the thyroid, in the ovaries and testes, in parts of the brain and lungs, and in the ducts of exocrine glands.Cuboidal epithelium is only one type of epithelial tissue in the body.imple cuboidal epithelia are found in the bronchioles of the lungs. The simple cuboidal epithelium are cube-shaped cells that line various surfaces and cavities throughout the body, including the thyroid gland. Simple cuboidal epithelia line the nephron, or the basic structural unit of the kidney.\n[14] Muscle tissue, one of the four major tissue types, plays the vital role of providing movement and heat generation to the organs of the body. Within muscle tissue are three distinct groups of tissues: skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and smooth muscle.isceral muscle cells are found in the organs, blood vessels, and bronchioles of the body to move substances throughout the body. Visceral muscles are also commonly known as smooth muscle due to their lack of striations.\n[15] A pulmonary lobule is the portion of the lung ventilated by one bronchiole. Bronchioles are approximately 1mm or less in diameter and their walls consist of ciliated cuboidal epithelium and a layer of smooth muscle. Bronchioles divide into even smaller bronchioles, called terminal, which are 0.5mm or less in diameter.he diameter of the bronchioles is often said to be less than 1 mm, though this value can actually range from 5 mm to 0.3 mm. As stated, these bronchioles do not have hyaline cartilage to maintain their patency. Instead, they rely on elastic fibers attached to the surrounding lung tissue for support.\n[16] Quick Answer. Tissues that make up the lungs include bronchioles, epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells and alveoli, according to Centre of the Cell.

Visceral muscles are also commonly known as smooth muscle due to their lack of striations.\n[19] The main function of the bronchi and bronchioles is to carry air from the trachea into the lungs. Smooth muscle tissue in their walls helps to regulate airflow into the lungs. When greater volumes of air are required by the body, such as during exercise, the smooth muscle relaxes to dilate the bronchi and bronchioles.he main function of the bronchi and bronchioles is to carry air from the trachea into the lungs. Smooth muscle tissue in their walls helps to regulate airflow into the lungs. When greater volumes of air are required by the body, such as during exercise, the smooth muscle relaxes to dilate the bronchi and bronchioles.\n[20] Bronchospasm, a potentially life-threatening situation, occurs when the smooth muscular tissue of the bronchioles constricts, severely narrowing their diameter. The most common cause of this is asthma. Bronchospasm is commonly treated by oxygen therapy and bronchodilators.he diameter of the bronchioles is often said to be less than 1 mm, though this value can actually range from 5 mm to 0.3 mm.

Hip replacement devices break into a few big categories: Metal on Metal (MOM) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 These are what they sound like. Both the socket and the ball are made of stainless steel, titanium, chromium, cobalt or some combination of these.\n[2] Hip replacements are among the most common orthopedic procedures. When a hip replacement is performed, the arthritic, damaged hip joint is removed. The ball-and-socket hip joint is then replaced with an artificial implant. Hare are brief descriptions of some of the most commonly used hip replacement implants. Not all implants are options for all patients. A prosthetic made of metal and plastic are the most commonly used hip replacement implants. Both the ball and the socket of the hip joint are replaced with a metal implant, and a plastic spacer is placed in between. The most commonly used metals used include titanium and stainless steel.\n[3] A.

A metal and plastic hinge joins the implants together. The procedure is similar to hip and knee replacements.\n[18] During the procedure, the surgeon makes an incision into the hip, removes the damaged joint and replaces it with an artificial joint made of metal alloy or ceramic. A modern artificial hip joint should last the patient for at least 15 years. How much does a hip replacement cost and what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the recovery time? A hip replacement may be offered for free on the NHS is the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case is deemed severe enough.\n[19] Every hip implant has a distinct set of benefits and risks. The key design features of each implant including size, material and dimensions make each system unique. In addition, the same hip implant system will have different outcomes in different patients. It is also important to recognize that hip implants may need to be replaced eventually. Factors that influence the longevity of the device include the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s age, sex, weight, diagnosis, activity level, conditions of the surgery, and the type of implant chosen. In the United States, there are currently five types of total hip replacement devices available with different bearing surfaces. These are: Metal-on-Polyethylene: The ball is made of metal and the socket is made of plastic (polyethylene) or has a plastic lining.\n[20] Ceramic Implants. Ceramic hip replacement implants also use metal parts that fit within the bone, but the bearing surface (the ball and the socket) can be made of the ceramic material. Ceramic hip implants are designed to be the most resistant to wear of all available hip replacement implants.\nSearch Query: what metal are hip replacements made of.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

The term chronometer is also used to describe a marine chronometer used for celestial navigation and determination of longitude. The marine chronometer was invented by John Harrison in 1730.

From then on, an accurate chronometer was essential to deep sea marine or air navigation out of sight of land.\n[3] The chronometer is an instrument that accurately measures time. The first one invented was a marine chronometer, and it was created out of the necessity to have an accurate timekeeper for sea travel. John Harrison, a British clockmaker, invented this device in 1737.\n[4] The invention of the chronometer was a fundamental building block for modern times. But the marine chronometer was then redesigned by John Arnold. He based his design on Harrison\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clock, but he simplified it enough to produce accurate marine chronometers in large quantities during the late 1700s.\n[5] John Harrison.

The Elusive Longitude Before the marine chronometer was invented, Latitude could be found quite accurately with celestial navigation and older instruments like the astrolabe. However, longitude could only be estimated, because an accurate determination of longitude is made by comparing time differences.\n[10] The British prize was won by John Harrison in 1764 for his seagoing chronometer accurate to one-tenth of a second per day. James Cook used Harrisons chronometer to circumvent the globe and when he returned in 1779 his calculations of longitude based upon the chronometer proved correct to within 8 miles.\n[11] Is there a battery-operated heated toilet seat?

If not addressed your females will then lay eggs all year. Laying eggs does take a lot out of them. So my advice would be to give your birds at least a 3 month break per year. If you're purchasing these quail as pets only and don't want any eggs, follow this procedure also.\n[12] The nests tend to be large because of the number of eggs they must accommodate.

After about three weeks, the eggs hatch into chicks. These chicks are instantly mobile and able to leave the nest.\n[13] Best Answer: It depends on what type of quail you have. I own button quail, and a button quail usually lives 21/2 years to 4 years. It's a little less for a female. It depends on how many eggs the female has laid and how adequate her nutrition is. The longest living button quail I've heard of is 9 years, but that is pretty rare.\n[14] 1 Always collect eggs at least once a day to prevent the quail sitting on the egg (both female and male will sit on the egg). 2 Realise that a quail only lays one egg a day. If your quails are still not laying eggs, this may indicate that they are sick.\n[15] A quail which is breed to lay eggs should receive 14 hours of light per day. This may mean that artificial lightning may be needed. If the quail receives the right amount of l \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 ight, they will approx.lay 1 egg per day. On average they will lay 200-300 eggs per year. I hope this answered your question.ow many eggs do quail lay at one time? No bird can lay more than an egg every day (or just a little less than 24 hours).\n[16] If the situation arises that Button quail eggs have to be incubated and / or any baby quail hand raised, this presents a bigger problem than with the other types of quail. The Coturnix quail instinctively pick up and eat food off the floor whereas the Button quail expect the food to be placed in their beak.uail often have no choice but to eat the foods that are supplied to the other birds. This is often a mix of basic finch seed mix along with some other select seeds and often a supply of live food such as mealworms. Mealworms can be fed as the larval (worm) stage as well as the pupa and beetle stage.\n[17] I am often asked how long it takes quail eggs to hatch. The incubation period for bobwhite quail eggs is 23-24 days. Here is a link to information on incubating bobwhite quail eggs http://www.farmingfriends.com/incubating-bobwhite-quail-eggs/. The incubation period for Coturnix (Japanese) quail eggs is 17 days. Here is a link for information about incubating japanese quail eggs.\n[18] Japanese quail eggs. are a mottled brown colour. and are often covered with a light blue, chalky. material. Each hen appears to lay eggs with a. characteristic shell pattern or colour. Some strains. lay only white eggs.\n[19] I am often asked how long it takes quail eggs to hatch.

The incubation period for Coturnix (Japanese) quail eggs is 17 days.\n[20] Quails mature at 6 to 8 weeks and should be laying eggs by then. Stress due to overcrowding, move in location, predators, etc., will reduce your quail's egg production. When your quail does begin to lay eggs, start supplementing oyster shells for calcium.\nSearch Query: how often to button quail lay eggs.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

In summary, skeletal muscles are attached to bones on each end by tendons. The origin is the fixed attachment, while the insertion moves with contraction. The action, or particular movement of a muscle, can be described relative to the joint or the body part moved.Groups of muscles are involved in most movements and names are used to describe the role of each muscle involved.keletal muscles attached to bone are responsible for movement and support. Muscles work in groups to produce a particular movement.

Your bones and muscles work together through a series of impulses and signals communicated between the brain and skeletal muscles. In order to move, the nervous system signals a skeletal muscle to contract.\n[8] How They Work Together. Working in unison, the joints, bones and skeletal muscles of the body comprise your musculoskeletal system. The primary function of these components working together is to create movement. Other functions include stability, posture and protection.orking in unison, the joints, bones and skeletal muscles of the body comprise your musculoskeletal system. The primary function of these components working together is to create movement.\n[9] The point of articulation, or where the muscles and the bones connect, is known as a joint. Tendons are a form of connective tissue that is continuous with muscle fiber and actually connects muscle to bone. Skeletal muscles that produce movement are attached to two bones that articulate, or meet.When movement occurs at any given joint, only one of the articulating bones will move.orking in unison, the joints, bones and skeletal muscles of the body comprise your musculoskeletal system. The primary function of these components working together is to create movement.\n[10] A tendon is a band of connective tissue that connects muscle to bone. The tendons and muscles work together to control joint movement. When a muscle contracts, it pulls on the tendon, which then pulls the bone to cause movement. tendon is a band of connective tissue that connects muscle to bone. The tendons and muscles work together to control joint movement. When a muscle contracts, it pulls on the tendon, which then pulls the bone to cause movement.\n[11] 2. Ligaments are fibrous strands that connect bones.3. Name the three types of muscles found in the body, and give a one-sentence description of what they do: Skeletal: These muscles hold bones together, give the body its shape, and help move bones.Smooth: These muscles aid in digestive process by moving food through digestive system, and they help regulate blood pressure.ead the articles at KidsHealth to learn about what the bones, muscles, and joints do and how they work together. Next, use the handout to create a chain diagram that describes the process of moving some part of the body, starting with the decision to move and ending with the actual coordination of movement.\n[12] Muscles, tendons, ligaments and joints all work together to produce movement due to the fact that they are all attached. As the muscles, tendons, and ligaments expand and cont \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 ract they pull the bones of the joint allowing the joint to move. Muscles work in groups, working in opposition one with the other In the arm, groups of muscles work by contracting and relaxing to produce gross and fine movement, \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 depending upon the task that the person wishes to carry out.\n[13] Introduction.

One muscl \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 e contracts while the other muscle relaxes, to move the bone again the other muscle contracts and the other one relaxes.\n[15] This system describes how bones are connected to other bones and muscle fibers via connective tissue such as tendons and ligaments. The bones provide stability to the body. Muscles keep bones in place and also play a role in the movement of bones.To allow motion, different bones are connected by joints.Cartilage prevents the bone ends from rubbing directly onto each other. Muscles contract to move the bone attached at the joint.he musculoskeletal system provides form, support, stability, and movement to the body. It is made up of the bones of the skeleton, muscles, cartilage, tendons, ligaments, joints, and other connective tissue that supports and binds tissues and organs together.\n[16] Yes.

The bones and joints of the skeletal system and the more than. 600 skeletal muscles of the muscular system function together as the musculoskeletal system to produce movements such as sitting up straight, walking, running, jumping and throwing.\n[19] Section 3 - 3. The ends of bones are covered with a smooth, slippery thick layer of tissue called cartilage. It is flexible because it acts as a shock absorber. It makes movement easier by reducing friction that would be caused by bones rubbing together.ection 2 - 4. Explain how your muscles, bones and joints work together to move your body. The action of muscles, bones and joints working together is like a lever. In your body, bones are rods, joints are fulcrums and contraction and relaxation of muscles provide the force to move body parts.\n[20] All exercises involve the kinetic chain, which the National Academy of Sports Medicine defines as the relationship or connection between your nerves, muscles and bones. The kinetic chain is broken into two categories, the open kinetic chain and closed kinetic chain, and is used to help describe or classify exercises.

This can be caused by stress, illness, an obstruction or surgery causing the thyroid to malfunction or be sluggish.\n[11] If TSH is high, it typically means that your thyroid function is too low (hypothyroid). If TSH is low, then it generally means the thyroid is overactive (hyperthyroid.) Your doctor may also check levels of other thyroid hormones in your blood.\n[12] TSH or thyroid stimulating hormone is a hormone produced in the anterior pituitary gland. This is used to help stimulate the thyroid to produce triiodothyronine (T3) or thyroxine (T4), hormones that help stimulate the metabolism.If your pituitary gland is producing TSH trying to stimulate the thyroid but the thyroid does not respond, it can result in an excessive amount of TSH in the bloodstream.earning what these levels mean will help you work with your doctor to address your condition adequately. 1 Normal TSH-Adults should have TSH hormone levels that range from 0.4-4.2 mU/L. 2 This indicates that the signals from your pituitary gland match the activity of your thyroid gland.\n[13] 1 A high TSH level means that your thyroid gland is underactive. When your thyroid gland is underactive and not producing enough thyroid hormone, your body produces more TSH to stimulate the gland and increase its activity. A low TSH level means that your thyroid gland is overactive.\n[14] The most obvious cause of a TSH change is a change in dosage. But sometimes, the interaction between TSH and dosage changes can be confusing. For example, you may remember your doctor saying your thyroid is low -- and interpret that as meaning that you are hypothyroid. But the doctor may have said -- or may have meant -- your TSH is low -- which is indicative of hyperthyroidism.\n[15] TSH is the main hormone tested by your doctor to determine if your thyroid gland is functioning properly. Too much TSH means the pituitary gland is trying to get a sluggish thyroid gland to work better. Too little means there is enough thyroxin in your body so TSH remains low until more is needed.\n[16] No: There are no such foods such as that. If your TSH level is low, that means your thyroid is overproducing thyroid hormone and that could be a goiter or other thyroid disease-you definitely need that checked and treated. If your thyroid hormone is low, then your TSH would be high.\n[17] What is TSH? TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) is a hormone that is produced by the pituitary gland; it is the job of the TSH to stimulate the thyroid and trigger the production of thyroid hormone. High TSH signifies that your thyroid is not producing enough hormone; a low TSH denotes an overproduction of thyroid hormone.\n[18] What does it mean if I have low MCHC, high RDW (SD and CV both) and low iron? In a hematology test the RDW value is 12.4, what does it mean? What does it mean when your MCV and MCHC are low?\n[19] Learning what these levels mean will help you work with your doctor to address your condition adequately. 1 Normal TSH-Adults should have TSH hormone levels that range from 0.4-4.2 mU/L. 2 This indicates that the signals from your pituitary gland match the activity of your thyroid gland.earning what these levels mean will help you work with your doctor to address your condition adequately. 1 Normal TSH-Adults should have TSH hormone levels that range from 0.4-4.2 mU/L. 2 This indicates that the signals from your pituitary gland match the activity of your thyroid gland.\n[20] What does a high TSH mean? High levels of TSH in the blood stream typically signal that the thyroid is underperforming. High TSH levels are a common signal of hypothyroidism that will require medical treatment to avoid potential health risks. TSH or thyroid stimulating hormone is a hormone produced in the anterior pituitary gland. This is used to help stimulate the thyroid to produce triiodothyronine (T3) or thyroxine (T4), hormones that help stimulate the metabolism.\nSearch Query: what does it mean if your tsh is low.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Granulation tissue does not mature into epithelium; instead, granulation tissue is eventually covered by a layer of epidermal tissue.\n[4] Granulation tissue is collagen-rich tissue which forms at the site of an injury. As the body heals, this tissue fills in the injury, and may eventually scar over. The scar may fade over time, especially if the wound is small. In some cases, the body produces too much granulation tissue, in a condition known as proud flesh, in which case medical treatment may be required to halt the overproduction. The appearance of granulation tissue is a good sign. When a wound starts granulating, it means that the body is starting to rebuild after the injury. This highly fibrous tissue is usually pink because the body produces numerous small blood vessels to provide a supply of oxygen and nutrients to remove waste.\n[5] Granulation tissue is mostly composed of new blood vessels and fibroblasts and also tissue matrix due to which it can support different cell types.

Why does sound need a medium like air or water in order to travel, but radio waves do not? What is the best medium for sound to travel through and why?\n[4] S, India. Unlike sound waves or ocean waves, radios waves do not travel in a material. Radio waves are a class of electromagnetic waves and consist of nothing more than electric and magnetic fields. Since they don't require any medium through which to travel, they can go right through empty space.That's why we're able to see the stars, after all.adio waves are a class of electromagnetic waves and consist of nothing more than electric and magnetic fields. Since they don't require any medium through which to travel, they can go right through empty space.\n[5] Electromagnetic waves: 1. Electromagnetic (EM) waves (example light waves, radio waves, x-rays etc) can travel through vacuum; they do not require any medium (matter) to travel through and their travel is reduced, to some extent, by the presence of any medium. The common examples of medium are glass, water, air etc.\n[6] No, a radio wave is not a mechanical wave.

Electromagnetic waves \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 (such as light, radio waves, X-rays, microwaves) do not need a medium to travel through, so these are not mechanical waves.\n[9] Best Answer: A sound wave is a type of pressure wave which can also be called a compression wave. Pressure waves depend on the presence of a medium such as air for it to travel through. Without the medium they cannot travel. Therefore neither A, C or D could travel through space as space is a vacuum lacking a medium. However, radio waves can travel through space. Radio waves form a section of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n[10] Light is not the only example of an electromagnetic wave. Other electromagnetic waves include the microwaves you use to heat up leftovers for dinner, and the radio waves that are broadcast from radio stations.roperties of electromagnetic waves. Something interesting about light, and electromagnetic waves in general, is that no medium is required for the wave to travel through. Other waves, such as sound waves, can not travel through a vacuum. An electromagnetic wave is perfectly happy to do that.\n[11] This means that they have to have some sort of matter to travel through. These waves travel when molecules in the medium collide with each other passing on energy. One example of a mechanical wave is sound. Sound can travel through air, water, or solids, but it can't travel through a vacuum. It needs the medium to help it travel. Other examples include water waves, seismic waves, and waves traveling through a spring. Electromagnetic waves are waves that can travel through a vacuum (empty space). They don't need a medium or matter. They travel through electrical and magnetic fields that are generated by charged particles. Examples of electromagnetic waves include light, microwaves, radio waves, and X-rays.\n[12] No, a radio wave is not a mechanical wave.

Radio waves can travel through the vacuum of space. Let's contrast that with a mechanical wave.\n[16] Rather, we are talking about the waves that transmit radio signals. The main difference between radio waves and sound waves is that radio waves are a type of electromagnetic wave that can travel when there is no medium, whereas sound waves are a type of mechanical wave that cannot travel if there is no medium. What are Radio Waves. Radio waves are electromagnetic waves. These are waves composed of electric and magnetic fields, which are oscillating at right angles to each other. The energy of an electromagnetic wave propagates at a direction at right angles to the oscillations in both the electric and magnetic fields.\n[17] How does a radio wave differ from a sound wave. A radio wave is an electromagnetic wave that travels at the speed of light, whereas a sound wave travels at the speed of sound through air or another elastic medium.\n[18] Since the actual oscillations take place at right angles to the direction of wave propagation, radio waves are transverse waves. Since radio waves are not mechanical, they do not need a medium to travel in; they can travel even in a vacuum. Like all types of electromagnetic waves, radio waves travel at a speed of about 300 000 km per second in a vacuum. When radio waves enter into other material, they slow down a little. When you tune a radio to listen to a particular frequency, the radio takes in the signals at that frequency.\n[19] Examples include light waves, radio waves, and X-rays All electromagnetic waves travel through space at the speed of light Since these waves can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be observed, we study mechanical waves. Electromagnetic Waves. Waves that DO NOT require a medium for motion.\n[20] As per the medium, the waves can be differentiated as mechanical and electromagnetic waves. Electromagnetic waves are waves that have no medium to travel whereas mechanical waves need a medium for its transmission. Electromagnetic waves travel in a vacuum whereas mechanical waves do not. The mechanical waves need a medium like water, air, or anything for it to travel. The ripples made in a pool of water after a stone is thrown in the middle are an example of mechanical waves. Examples of electromagnetic waves include light and radio signals.\nSearch Query: what medium do radio waves travel through.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.
