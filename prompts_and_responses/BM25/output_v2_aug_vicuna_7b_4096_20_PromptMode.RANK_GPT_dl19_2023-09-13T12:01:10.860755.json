Part of the Video Series: Flea Control.\n[2] The life cycle of a flea can last anywhere from 20 days to an entire year. It depends on how long the flea remains in the dormant stage (eggs, larvae, pupa). Outside influences, such as weather, affect the flea cycle. A female flea can lay around 20 to 25 eggs in one day. The flea egg stage is the beginning of the flea cycle. This part of the flea cycle represents a little more than one third of the flea population at any given time. Depending on the temperature and humidity of the environment the egg can take from two to six days to hatch.\n[3] The life cycle of a flea can last anywhere from 20 days to an entire year.

A female flea can lay around 20 to 25 eggs in one day.\n[4] Flea Pupa. The flea larvae spin cocoons around themselves in which they move to the last phase of the flea life cycle and become adult fleas. The larvae can remain in the cocoon anywhere from one week to one year. Temperature is one factor that determines how long it will take for the adult flea to emerge from the cocoon.\n[5] 2) The fleas life cycle discussed - the flea life cycle diagram explained in full. 2a) Fleas life cycle 1 - The adult flea lays her eggs on the host animal. 2b) Fleas life cycle 2 - The egg falls off the animal's skin and into the local environment of the host animal. 2c) Fleas life cycle 3 - The flea egg hatches, releasing a first stage (stage 1) flea larva.\n[6] The cat flea's primary host is the domestic cat, but it is also the primary flea infesting dogs in most of the world. The cat flea can also maintain its life cycle on other carnivores and on omnivores. Humans can be bitten, though a long-term population of cat fleas cannot be sustained and infest people.However, if the female flea is allowed to feed for 12 consecutive hours on a human, it can lay viable eggs.he cat flea's primary host is the domestic cat, but it is also the primary flea infesting dogs in most of the world.

Larvae make up about 35 percent of the flea population in the average household. If conditions are favorable, the larvae will spin cocoons in about 5-20 days of hatching from their eggs.This leads to the next life stage, called the cocoon or pupae stage.The pupae stage of the flea life cycle accounts for about 10 percent of the flea population in a home.f conditions are favorable, the larvae will spin cocoons in about 5-20 days of hatching from their eggs.

Optimal conditions for fleas are between 70-85\u00b0F and 70 percent humidity.\n[19] LIFE CYCLE. Unlike most fleas, adult cat fleas remain on the host where feeding, mating, and egg laying occur. Females lay about 20 to 50 eggs per day. Cat flea eggs are pearly white, oval, and about 1/32 inch long (Figure 3).\n[20] After about 2 days (range 2-21 days), depending on environmental conditions, the flea egg hatches torelease a first stage flea larva.

The parties involved in a declaratory judgment may not later seek another court resolution of the same legal issue unless they appeal the judgment.\n[2] Rule 57. These rules govern the procedure for obtaining a declaratory judgment under 28 U.S.C. \u00a72201. Rules 38 and 39 govern a demand for a jury trial. The existence of another adequate remedy does not preclude a declaratory judgment that is otherwise appropriate. The court may order a speedy hearing of a declaratory-judgment action.\n[3] Common law. 1 Consent judgment: a consent judgment is available where the parties agree on the terms of the judgment or order that should be made. 2 Declaratory judgment: a declaratory judgment can be made by the courts regardless of whether a remedy is being claimed.\n[4] The same court observed that even if the basic requirements for A Declaratory Judgment Action are met, it is still within the discretion of the district court to decline a Declaratory Judgment Action.. This is in accordance with appellate decisions as well: Declaratory relief is a matter of district court discretion.\n[5] 9.3 Declaratory Judgment Act. The Declaratory Judgment Act offers a unique mechanism by which advocates may seek to remedy ongoing violations of statutory or constitutional provisions. The Act may authorize broad-based declaratory and injunctive relief without resort to class action procedures.\n[6] Declaratory judgments are judgment of a court in a civil case that declares the rights, duties, or obligations of each party in a dispute. However, a declaratory judgment does not order any action or result in any award of damages to any party to the case.\n[7] A ruling by a court (or, less commonly, a regulator) that resolves a dispute but does not order an action. That is, a declaratory judgment states a fact. For example, a declaratory judgment may state who owns a patent or a piece of property.\n[8] One factor which supports the dismissal of a declaratory judgment action is the conduct of the insurer in filing such a declaratory judgment action to pre-empt the insured from having a choice of forum in a first party claim.\n[9] An insurance company, for example, might seek a declaratory judgment as to whether a policy applies to a certain person or event. Declaratory judgments also commonly involve individuals or parties who seek to determine their rights under specific regulatory or criminal laws.\n[10] In most U.S. states and Canada, the insurer generally has four main options at this point, to: 1 defend the insured unconditionally; 2 defend the insured under a reservation of rights; 3 seek a declaratory judgment that it has no duty to defend the claim; or. 4 decline to defend or to seek a declaratory judgment.\n[11] That is especially true in situations where a non-. practicing entity has sent a licensing offer to a potential infringer.

In Wi-Fi, range depends on the version of Wi-Fi protocol applied and addition of antennas in the communication system while no such concerns of range or extra antenna are much known in Bluetooth. . Bluetooth vs. WiFi - Devices Connected: In Bluetooth, upto 7 devices can be connected to each other (piconet) while in Wi-Fi, the maximum connections depend on Wi-Fi router which can accommodate 1 to several communicating devices at a time.\n[2] Also like WiFi, Bluetooth is \"fairly\" secure. Unlike WiFi, tethering via Bluetooth isn't all that common. Sure, people do it, but it's a little more involved to set up than WiFi, and a little more involved every time you want to use Bluetooth tethering. If power consumption is a concern, Bluetooth is probably the way to go, if you're willing to configure it.\n[3] New Arrival.

Hope everything fine. I'm writing to you to ask for a quick feedback regarding these set of speakers I would like to buy. Sonos Airplay 3: price is about 300 eur. I listened them and I was well impressed about sounds quality. Of course I know it is a plus the possibility to compose with the other speakers but as a negative point, for what i've understood you would need always to be connected to the internet to use the wifi connection.\n[5] The choice of Bluetooth or WiFi is clear. Bluetooth is a universal standard and easy to use. But, its range is quite limited and sound quality is restricted. WiFi systems have a wider range and can offer excellent fidelity. But, different systems that use WiFi are incompatible, and setup may be difficult.\n[6] Related: wifi repeater wifi router wifi long range antenna wifi range extender wireless router bluetooth transmitter wifi extender outdoor wifi antenna wifi antenna.\n[7] This bluetooth dongle gives a computer bluetooth capabilities via a USB port.

It also steamed with my Dell wifi / Bluetooth card and will not work with the new Intel 7260 AC Bluetooth driver. The only common device here is the Intel card and drivers.\n[14] I use a separate usb wifi adapter. I heard that bluetooth and wifi work the same way. Just want to know if it will apply to this or not. WiFi LAN communication protocol is completely different and is used when high speeds are required and communication distances are much further.\n[15] NFC, or Near Field Communication, is essentially just another transceiver inside your phone or tablet.

Unlicensed Mobile Access is a technology that allows a UMA capable mobile phone to seamlessly switch back and forth between mobile phone networks and local wireless networks. WiFi and Bluetooth are commonly used for the local wireless part of the system.\n[19] WiFi has a greater range than Bluetooth \u2013 perhaps as much as 120 feet indoors, but the actual range may be less. With some planning, WiFi can cover an entire house. One way to assure maximum coverage is to locate the WiFi router in the center of a house, or where its coverage is most useful.\n[20] 1 A lower priced dongle such as the Bluetooth USB 2.0 Dongle retails for $3 to $20 on Amazon. 2 When used as a WiFi dongle, this hardware provides WiFi connectivity to a computer that does not have a built-in Wi-Fi modem. 3 These type of dongles can cost anywhere from $3 to as much as $30.

At room temperature and under standard pressure conditions, hydrogen is a gas that is tasteless, odorless and colorless. Hydrogen can exist as a liquid under high pressure and an extremely low temperature of 20.28 kelvin (\u2212252.87\u00b0C, \u2212423.17 \u00b0F). Hydrogen is often stored in this way as liquid hydrogen takes up less space than hydrogen in its normal gas form. Liquid hydrogen is also used as a rocket fuel.\n[8] Buy Compressed Hydrogen Gas or Liquid Hydrogen (H2) Buy Compressed Hydrogen Gas or Liquid Hydrogen (H2) We offer compressed hydrogen gas and liquid hydrogen (H2) in a variety of purities and concentrations. See the chart below and download the spec sheets and safety data sheets for more information on buying liquid hydrogen and hydrogen gas from Praxair.\n[9] A further temperature decrease below the boiling point eventually results in mixtures of liquid and solid hydrogen or slush hydrogen, SLH 2. Slush offers the advantages of a higher density and a prolongation of the storage time of the cryogen as the solid melts and absorbs heat. A safety risk is\n[10] Other molecules, as small as water (eg CO2), change from liquid to gas at temperatures far below that of water. It is also the Hydrogen bond which is responsible for the large amount of heat energy needed to convert water from liquid to gas.\n[11] The hydrogen gas that makes up most of the atmosphere slowly changes to liquid with depth as the pressure increases. Below the liquid hydrogen rests the heavier liquid helium. Deep in the depths of the body of Saturn, the hydrogen is then under tremendous pressure, and is transformed to liquid metallic hydrogen.\n[12] Gas to Liquid: Water change from a gas (water vapor) to a liquid through the process of condensation. The gas cools and loses energy which forces the particles-hydrogen and oxygen in the case of water-to change state from a gas to a liquid.Liquid to Solid: When water as a liquid turns to water as a solid (ice) it goes through the process of freezing. The liquid cools below the freezing point and loses energy.ydrogen and oxygen are elements. What that really means is that when an atom, the fundamental unit that makes up everything, has 1 proton (a positively charged sub-atomic particle) it is a hydrogen atom, and when it has 8 protons, it is an oxygen atom. Hydrogen gas is two hydrogen atoms bonded together, H 2.\n[13] Atmosphere. The composition of Jupiter's atmosphere is similar to that of the sun\u2014mostly hydrogen and helium. Deep in the atmosphere, the pressure and temperature increase, compressing the hydrogen gas into a liquid. At depths about a third of the way down, the hydrogen becomes metallic and electrically conducting.he composition of Jupiter's atmosphere is similar to that of the sun\u2014mostly hydrogen and helium. Deep in the atmosphere, the pressure and temperature increase, compressing the hydrogen gas into a liquid. At depths about a third of the way down, the hydrogen becomes metallic and electrically conducting.\n[14] Not all gases are flammable. eg carbon dioxide, nitrogen or helium. Flammable gases are those which react easily with oxygen in the air to cause combustion... such as hydrogen, methane or propane etc. Even flammable liquids are flammable only because they give off a flammable gas at temperatures below. Gasoline evaporates at room temperature into a mixture of flammable gases which are far more flammable than the liquid itself.\n[15] Examples include butane, acetylene, methane and hydrogen. Flammable liquids are identified as liquids that have a flashpoint (minimum temperature needed for the liquid to produce a vapor with enough of a concentration to ignite) below 100 degrees Fahrenheit (F). There is an exception to this definition. If any of the components of the mixture have flashpoints of 100 deg. F or higher, then the material is classified as combustible rather than flammable. Another way to identify flammable liquids is by class. It is important to remember that with flammable liquids that it is the vapor coming off of the liquid that will ignite and burn, not necessarily the liquid itself.\n[16] Hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless gas. Its density is the lowest of any chemical element, 0.08999 grams per liter. By comparison, a liter of air weighs 1.29 grams, 14 times as much as a liter of hydrogen. Hydrogen changes from a gas to a liquid at a temperature of -252.77\u00b0C (-422.99\u00b0F) and from a liquid to a solid at a temperature of -259.2\u00b0C (-434.6\u00b0F). It is slightly soluble in water, alcohol, and a few other common liquids.\n[17] What non-metals are solids or liquids or gases in room temperature? Non metal elements that are gases at room temperature are: Hydrogen, H2; Nitrogen, N2; Oxygen, O2; Fluorine, F2; Chlorine, Cl2; Helium, He; Neon, Ne; Argon, Ar; Krypton, Kr; \u2026 Xenon, Xe; Radon, Rn. Bromine, Br2, is a liquid. 7 people found this useful. Answered.\n[18] Ice is the solid form that liquid water takes when it is cooled below 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit). Ice melts due to the chemical properties of water. There are more hydrogen bonds between the molecules of ice than in water. Ice begins to melt when its temperature exceeds 0 degrees Celsius and hydrogen bonds between water molecules break.\n[19] BUT, because the concentration of hydrogen ions in water is ALWAYS the same as the concentration of hydroxide ions in water, liquid water will ALWAYS be neutral! The table below gives the value for the ion product for water, Kw, at various temperatures.\n[20] Mercury and water are both liquid at room temperature and 1 atmosphere of pressure. You can make water boil, however, by putting it in a vacuum! Boiling is the process of a substance changing from liquid to gas phase.or Hydrogen, the boiling point is -253 degrees Celsius; for Mercury it is 357 degrees Celsius, and for Iron it is 2,750 degrees Celsius. From these numbers you can see that at room temperature (and indeed for nearly any temperature found on Earth) Hydrogen is a gas, Mercury is a liquid, and Iron is a solid.\nSearch Query: hydrogen is a liquid below what temperature.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Also known as social and physical determinants of health, they impact a wide range of health, functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes. Examples of social determinants include: Availability of resources to meet daily needs, such as educational and job opportunities, living wages, or healthful foods.\n[10] About social determinants of health The social determinants of health are the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age. These circumstances are shaped by the distribution of money, power and resources at global, national and local levels. The social determinants of health are mostly responsible for health inequities - the unfair and avoidable differences in health status seen within and between countries. Key concepts\n[11] Social determinants of health affect factors that are related to health outcomes. Factors related to health outcomes include: 1 How a person develops during the first few years of life (early childhood development). 2 How much education a persons obtains. 3 Being able to get and keep a job.hese social determinants of health also interact with and influence individual behaviors as well.

The required return on this stock is 15 percent, and the stock currently sells for $42.50 per share. What is the projected dividend for the coming year?\n[7] The short answer: No. Here are three reasons why. The 30 percent rule has roots in 1969 public housing regulations, which capped public housing rent at 25 percent of a tenant's income (it inched up to 30 percent in the early 1980s). Rather than looking at what consumers should be spending on housing, however, the government selected the percentages because that's what consumers were spending.\n[8] Saturated, Polyunsaturated, Monounsaturated--What Does It All Mean?

The federal government's Digital Analytics Program (DAP) has found that Windows is the most popular end-user operating system with 58.4 percent of all government web site visitors. What's more interesting though is what versions of Windows we're using and what's number two and three behind Windows. The government's data, derived from 1.39 billion web visits to more than 37 government agencies over the last 90 days, reveals that the second place operating system is Apple iOS with 16.4 percent. It's followed close by Android with 13.9 percent.\n[12] Opinions differ over what constitutes a safe number of executives on the same flight. 40 percent of companies limit the number to three or four. 33 percent allow more than 10 employees to travel together. 13 percent limit the number to five or six. 8 percent limit the number to one or two, and an equal percentage say seven or eight is acceptable.\n[13] This is a false assumption.

The three levels are bulls at 1,700 pounds, 2,000 pounds and 2,300 pounds. The daily maintenance or zero-weight-gain ration (hay or grass) varies by the size of the bull. A 1,700-pound bull needs a daily intake of 33 pounds of dry matter that is 7 percent protein and 46 percent total digestible nutrients (TDN).\n[17] After three years, 0.4 percent of the tax will remain to fund road projects. The sales tax in Sedgwick County will climb from 6.3 percent to 7.3 percent, which is what it was for the 30 months from July 1, 2005, to Dec. 31, 2007, when the 1-cent countywide sales tax to finance Intrust Bank Arena was in effect.\n[18] It is not that shoppers are spending less than they should on food in general. We spend 17 percent of our food shopping dollars on refined grains (more than three times what is recommended). \u2026And while the USDA recommends spending less than 1 percent on sugar and candies, most Americans spend closer to 14 percent of their food budget on sweets.\n[19] Improper payment rates are in the 20 to 25 percent range in the tax credit program -- but are 10 percent or less in the other three programs. So, even the average among the four programs would be far less than what Johnson claimed.\n[20] So if you paid $400,000 upfront and lived in the village for 12 years with a three percent DMF fee, you would pay 10 times three percent, or 30 percent of $400,000 ($120,000) as your DMF. In effect, this means your 'rent' was $10,000 per year or $190 per week.he benefit is that you know what your weekly expenses are going to be in advance, not only for the next 12 months but well into the distant future. The second cost of living in a village community is the Departure Management Fee (DMF). This is paid when you depart the village so it does not affect your weekly budget.\nSearch Query: what are the three percenters?.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Due to the close proximity of organs in the abdominal and pelvic cavity, it is not always possible to isolate a specific organ when pain occurs at a particular region. Therefore the most common conditions of the nearest organs to this area needs to be considered. Pain may arise from the hip joint itself or the pelvic bone but there are also other possible conditions as discussed below.

Acute pelvic pain is pain that starts over a short period of time anywhere from a few minutes to a few days. This type of pain is often a warning sign that something is wrong and should be evaluated promptly. Pelvic pain can be caused by an infection or inflammation. An infection doesn't have to affect the reproductive organs to cause pelvic pain. Pain caused by the bladder, bowel, or appendix can produce pain in the pelvic region; diverticulitis, irritable bowel syndrome, kidney or bladder stones, as well as muscle spasms or strains are some examples of non-reproductive causes of pelvic or lower abdominal pain.\n[11] 1 Abdominal pain and Pelvic pain and Musculoskeletal symptoms (39 causes). 2 Abdominal pain and Pelvic pain and Lower abdominal symptoms (38 causes). 3 Abdominal pain and Pelvic pain and Skeletal symptoms (37 causes). 4 Abdominal pain and Pelvic pain and MORE SYMPTOMS.\n[12] Understanding the Cause and Treatment of Pelvic Fluid.

Pain along the waist line may be caused by abnormal function of any of the organs in the pelvic region of the body. Depending on the cause of the problem, waist pain might be mild or severe, aching or throbbing. Sitting and sleeping in improper position may lead to the pain located on the right side of the waist.\n[14] Although pelvic pain often refers to pain in the region of women's internal reproductive organs, pelvic pain can be present in men, too, and can stem from multiple causes. Pelvic pain may be a symptom of infection or may arise from pain in the pelvic bone or in non-reproductive internal organs, such as the bladder or colon. In women, however, pelvic pain can very well be an indication that there may be a problem with one of the reproductive organs in the pelvic area (uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix, or vagina). What Causes Pelvic Pain? Possible causes of pelvic pain in both men and women may include: Appendicitis; Bladder disorders; Sexually transmitted diseases\n[15] Pelvic Pain: What's Causing Your Pelvic Pain? There are many causes of pelvic pain in women including uterine fibroids, cysts, PMS, appendicitis, bladder infections, and unusual vulvar pain. Pelvic pain has symptoms that can be uncomfortable, but luckily there are treatments for pelvic pain.\n[16] They're usually harmless and go away on their own. But they may cause pelvic pain, pressure, swelling, and bloating. And if a cyst bursts or twists, it can cause sudden, severe pain, sending you to the emergency room.

Chronic pelvic pain can result from more than one condition. Pelvic pain can arise from your digestive, reproductive or urinary system. Recently, doctors have recognized that some pelvic pain, particularly chronic pelvic pain, can also arise from muscles and connective tissue (ligaments) in the structures of the pelvic floor. Occasionally, pelvic pain might be caused by irritation of nerves in the pelvis.\n[19] Chronic pelvic pain can be intermittent or constant. Intermittent chronic pelvic pain usually has a specific cause, while constant pelvic pain may be the result of more than one problem. A common example of chronic pelvic pain is dysmenorrhea or menstrual cramps. Other causes of chronic pelvic pain include endometriosis, adenomyosis, and ovulation pain. Sometimes an illness starts with intermittent pelvic pain that becomes constant over time, this is often a signal that the problem has become worse.\n[20] Causes of the Tailbone Pain in Early Pregnancy (First Trimester). During pregnancy, the hormones relaxin and estrogen cause relaxation of the ligaments in the pelvic floor, which allows the coccyx to shift more than usually; this can cause pain.Pregnancy may worsen the tailbone pain caused by pre-existing conditions, such as: 1 Constipation.2 Herniated disc in the lower back \u2014 pain may be located in the sacral area or in the left or right buttock and may spread down a leg and possibly causing tingling in the feet.3 Lower back injury, a fall on the tailbone.uring pregnancy, the hormones relaxin and estrogen cause relaxation of the ligaments in the pelvic floor, which allows the coccyx to shift more than usually; this can cause pain.

USER: I will provide you with 20 passages, each indicated by a numerical identifier []. Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: how are some sharks warm blooded.\n\n[1] Most sharks are cold-blooded. Some, like the Mako and the Great white shark, are partially warmblooded (they are endotherms). Cold blooded although if you've ever seen a Great White Shark hunt sea lions you'd be thinking they would have to be hotblooded. Actually the Salmon Shark is a warm blooded shark.\n[2] Are sharks cold-blooded or warm-blooded? Sharks have a reputation as \"cold-blooded killers\" and despite how negative that term is, it's not entirely inaccurate. Sharks are by no means evil, vicious killers like that quote suggests. Nonetheless, sharks are, for the most part anyways, efficient ectothermic predators. Endo vs Ecto.\n[3] Great white sharks are some of the only warm blooded sharks. This allows them to swim in colder waters in addition to warm, tropical waters. Great White sharks can be found as\u2026 north as Alaska and as south as the southern tip of South America. They exist worldwide, everywhere in-between. 5 people found this useful.\n[4] Sharks' blood gives them turbo speed. Several species of shark and tuna have something special going on inside their bodies. For a long time, scientists have known that some fish species appear warm-blooded. Salmon sharks can elevate their body temperatures by up to 20 degrees compared to the surrounding water, for example.\n[5] More on Warm-Bodied Sharks. Shortfin Mako (Isurus oxyrinchus) A question came across SHARK-L concerning makos being considered warm-blooded and various replies touch upon aspects of the topic. I responded to the original query and went onto expand upon or correct some of those responses.\n[6] Regardless sharks are cold blooded, they live either in warm, temperate and cold waters. Some species live mainly in cold waters, while some others prefer warmer waters. SHARK MIGRATION. One thing is for sure; sharks migrate to find new sources of food and they can travel up to hundreds of miles to do that. Most species of sharks live in the oceans. However, some of them are known to dwell in bodies of freshwater, like the bull shark which travels up to 4,000 Km up the Amazon River. Sometimes, sharks reach freshwater bodies; this could be the result of the destruction of their habitat by human activities.\n[7] They could be either predators (e.g. Killer whale) or filter feeders. Whales are long lived mammals with a lifespan of 70 \u2013 100 years. Differences between Shark and Whale. \u2022 Sharks are fish and cold-blooded, whereas whales are warm-blooded mammals.\u2022 Sharks have a cartilaginous skeleton, but it is a bony skeleton in whales. \u2022 Whales are generally larger in body size than sharks.\u2022 Whales have lungs sharks have gills for breathing. \u2022 The body of the whale is covered with hair but shark has dermal denticles covering the skin.hey could be either predators (e.g. Killer whale) or filter feeders.

Differences between Shark and Whale. \u2022 Sharks are fish and cold-blooded, whereas whales are warm-blooded mammals.\n[8] These sharks can raise their temperature about th\u2026e temperature of the water; they need to have occasional short bursts of speed in hunting Cold blooded although if you've ever seen a Great White Shark hunt sea lions you'd be thinking they would have to be hotblooded. Actually the Salmon Shark is a warm blooded shark.\n[9] Are White Sharks warm-blooded or cold-blooded? White sharks are part of the fish family, so they must be 'cold-blooded', right? Actually, white sharks are much more complex than you may think. An animal that is 'cold-blooded' means their inside body temperature is dependent on the environment they are in. For example, a snake is cold blooded, so its body temperature fluctuates with the day or even whether or not they are in the sun.\n[10] Some fish are ectothermic such as the Blue shark whereas others are endothermic such as swordfish and Lamnid sharks.ndothermic = warm-blooded Ectothermic = cold-blooded Endotherms are able to maintain their own body temperature, whereas Ectotherms rely on their environment to regulate body \u2026 temperature.\n[11] Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: Whales, seals, dolphins, and otters are mammals (warm blooded creatures that give birth to live young. Some sharks give live birth, some eggs, and some are eggs in the uterus, but are born live. Seals find a nice beach and give birth to their pups there.ut whales, dolphins and otters (I'm supposing it's sea otters you're talking about) give birth in water. Although their babies are born in water and can swim, they need adults to help them to the surface to breathe. As for sharks, most lay eggs, but some do give live birth.\n[12] For many people, sharks are the epitome of the 'cold-blooded killer'. The warm-bodied mackerel sharks are spectacular reminders that many of our stereotypes are inaccurate. As apex predators, sharks are absolutely essential to the health and vigor of marine ecosystems.\n[13] HOW DO SHARKS BREATHE? Beneath the gills are tiny blood vessels that extract oxygen out of the water as it passes over them. Most shark species breathe by swimming with their mouths open which allows the water to pass over the gills. Some sharks like nurse, angel and lemon sharks have strong neck muscles that pump water over the gills, allowing the shark to breathe while resting on the ocean bottom. Sharks are fish, and therefore breathe through the use of\n[14] Powerful Sense of Smell. The strongest sense for a shark is their smell. It is a common myth though that sharks can smell blood miles away and then they will find the person or animal that it is coming from. While sharks can smell blood, it often indicates to them that there is wounded prey they can easily overpower. It may surprise you to learn that the nostrils on a shark aren't used for smelling. In fact, they aren't even attached to their mouths. It isn't an instinct of killing that the blood is going to create in them. In fact, if they aren't hungry then they won't even bother to look for the source of the smell. Some of the species though can smell and indicate even a single drop of blood in the water. This is just an example of how powerful their sense of smell really is.\n[15] Meat refers to the meat of warm-blooded animals. Beef, pork, venison, chicken, turkey, lamb, etc. are all considered meat by the Church. The Church does not consider cold-blooded animals to be meat. You can eat fish, shark, eel, alligator, frog legs, and turtle soup on Fridays during Lent.So that's how you know what's meat and what isn't. Birds and mammals are meat; reptiles, amphibians, fish, and invertebrates are not considered meat.ou can eat fish, shark, eel, alligator, frog legs, and turtle soup on Fridays during Lent.

Some of its closest living relatives do not have the capabilities of osmoregulation. The bull shark's genus, Carcharhinus, is shared by the sand bar shark that is not capable of osmoregulation.\n[17] Tiger Shark \u2013 Galeocerdo cuvier. Tiger sharks are very large and so they require a considerable amount of wide open space. They enjoy warm water so they are found in the tropic areas of the world as well as some sub tropic locations.ating Habits of Tiger Sharks. A tiger shark will eat any type of fish, shark, animal, and small entity it can find in the water. They are very curious by nature and will taste anything that comes their way. The stomachs of tiger sharks have been found with some very unique items inside of them.\n[18] Sharks live in every ocean. Sharks swim in every ocean of the world, from warm tropic waters to icy polar. seas. Some live in the deep, dark waters of the ocean, while others bask in sunlit. waters close to the surface. Some prefer the high seas, others live in water closer. to shore. A few sharks even swim up rivers, and at least one species, the bull. shark, is sometimes found in fresh water lakes. 2. All sharks look alike. No, many kinds of sharks which live in the open ocean have torpedo-shaped. bodies.\n[19] Bull Sharks Are Found All Over The World. Bull sharks are found the world over in just about every place a shark might typically live, and even some where most sharks can't. They like tropical and warm temperate areas, but will make seasonal forays into cool, temperate waters.\n[20] Shark is the largest sea mammal in the world. There are a lots of shark species which are present in different oceans of the world. Among these shark species Whale Shark is the biggest shark in the world.Here is the list of names of largest sharks in the world with their habitat info.he Whale Shark is the largest and the heaviest living shark because its weight is more than 21 tons and its length is more than 12 meter. It is found in open oceans and warm waters. It feeds on plankton but some times it also uses other small fishes as food.\nSearch Query: how are some sharks warm blooded.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

The formula for this length is the sum of the length of side A plus the length of side B, divided by two. The midsegment is also used to calculate the area of a trapezoid. Learn more about Shapes.\n[2] Extended Conjecture: (Trapezoid Midsegment Conjecture): The midsegment of a trapezoid is parallel to the bases and is equal in length to the average of the lengths of the two bases. Explanation: A midsegment of a trapezoid is a segment that connects the midpoints of the two non-parallel sides of a trapezoid. This segment has two special properties. It is parallel to the bases of the trapezoid. The length of the midsegment is the average of the lengths of the two bases. Remember that the bases of a trapezoid are parallel. Key Curriculum Press can provide demo versions of Geometer's Sketch Pad.\n[3] A trapezoid midsegment connects the midpoints of the two congruent sides of the trapezoid, and is parallel to the pair of parallel sides. The length of the midsegment is the sum of the two bases divided by 2. Remember that the bases of a trapezoid are the two parallel sides. To find angles within a trapezoid, remember that since there are two sides are parallel, the other sides can be seen as transversals, forming corresponding angles and same side interior angles.\n[4] The midsegment of a trapezoid has two special properties: 1 The midsegment of a trapezoid is parallel to each base. 2 The length of the midsegment of a trapezoid is equal to half the sum of the lengths of its bases.\n[5] The side of the triangle that the midsegment does not intersect is the base of the triangle. The midsegment of a trapezoid is the segment formed by connecting the midpoints of the two legs of a trapezoid. Although the midsegment of a trapezoid is also useful in mathematics, we will not discuss it here.\n[6] The midsegment of a trapezoid is the segment that joins the midpoints of the nonparallel sides of a trapezoid. In the trapezoid below, the midpoints of the non-parallel sides are points S and V. The midsegment is the red line segment from S to V. The midsegment below can be found by. 1 calculating the lengths of the bases. 2 35-16 = 9 (length of upper base). 3 45-0 =45 (length of lower base). 4 calculating the sum of the bases.\n[7] This segment's length is always equal to one-half the sum of the trapezoid's bases, or. Consider trapezoid ABCD shown below. The midsegment, EF, which is shown in red, has a length of. The measurement of the midsegment is only dependent on the length of the trapezoid's bases.\n[8] The midsegment (also called the median or midline) of a trapezoid is the segment that joins the midpoints of the legs. It is parallel to the bases. Its length m is equal to the average of the lengths of the bases a and b of the trapezoid, The midsegment of a trapezoid is one of the two bimedians (the other bimedian divides the trapezoid into equal areas). The height (or altitude) is the perpendicular distance between the bases.\n[9] The midsegment of a trapezoid is the segment that joins the midpoints of the nonparallel sides of a trapezoid. In the trapezoid below, the midpoints of the non-parallel sides are points S and V. The midsegment is the red line segment from S to V. The midsegment below can be found by. 1 calculating the lengths of the bases. 2 35-16 = 9 (length of upper base). 3 45-0 =45 (length of lower base). 4 calculating the sum of the bases. 5 9+45 = 54.\n[10] The midpoint of the red segment pictured on the left is the point (A, 2b). The most important thing to remember is that a midpoint bisects a line (cuts a line into two equal halves). The midsegment of a trapezoid is the segment that joins the midpoints of the nonparallel sides of a trapezoid. In the trapezoid below, the midpoints of the non-parallel sides are points S and V. The midsegment is the red line segment from S to V. The midsegment below can be found by. calculating the lengths of the bases 35-16 = 9 (length of upper base) 45-0 =45 (length of lower base) calculating the sum of the bases 9+45 = 54.\n[11] The top and bottom sides of the trapezoid run parallel to each other, so they are the trapezoid's bases. The other sides of the trapezoid will intersect if extended, so they are the trapezoid's legs. The segment that connects the midpoints of the legs of a trapezoid is called the midsegment.\n[12] The opposite sides of a trapezoid that are parallel to each other are called bases. The remaining sides of the trapezoid, which intersect at some point if extended, are called the legs of the trapezoid. The top and bottom sides of the trapezoid run parallel to each other, so they are the trapezoid's bases. The other sides of the trapezoid will intersect if extended, so they are the trapezoid's legs. The segment that connects the midpoints of the legs of a trapezoid is called the midsegment.\n[13] The segment that connects the midpoints of the legs of a trapezoid is called the midsegment. This segment's length is always equal to one-half the sum of the trapezoid's bases, or. Consider trapezoid ABCD shown below.\n[14] The midsegment (also called the median or midline) of a trapezoid is the segment that joins the midpoints of the legs. It is parallel to the bases. Its length m is equal to the average of the lengths of the bases a and b of the trapezoid,\n[15] In the trapezoid below, the midpoints of the non-parallel sides are points S and V.

Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: difference between a mcdouble and a double cheeseburger.\n\n[1] There is a discernible difference between the two burgers, especially in the meat quality. The McDouble contains gristle and carry's a different flavor than the Double Cheeseburger. The double cheeseburger tastes more like beef. The McDouble tastes of whatever meat filler they use to fill the gap.\n[2] Review: Triple Cheeseburger from McDonald's. When it comes to the various sizes of classic McDonald's cheeseburgers, the prices might have you scratching your head. The price differences between a McDonald's Cheeseburger, the beefier McDouble and the cheesier Double Cheeseburger now all fall within 50-cents of one another.\n[3] At first glance, the double cheeseburger looks a lot like the McDouble, but it is not exactly the same thing. The main difference that you will notice is the amount of cheese that is on this sandwich. There are two slices of cheese on the double cheeseburger instead of just the one slice of cheese that comes on the McDouble. Even though it comes with two slices of cheese, it still has the onions, pickles, ketchup and mustard that come on the other burgers.\n[4] But I did it for you. With McDonald's recent release of the McDouble, they now have three basic, sub-$2 cheeseburgers: the cheeseburger, McDouble (two patties with one slice of cheese), and double cheeseburger (two patties with two slices of cheese).\n[5] Although we previously reported that the McDouble would be on the Dollar Menu, in Manhattan the cheeseburger appears on the Dollar Menu while the McDouble is $1.39 and the double cheeseburger is $1.49.\n[6] The Double Cheesburger is now $1.19 instead of a buck. Seriously, $.19/slice of cheese and a removal from the Dollar Menu. Do I order the Double Cheeseburger at its new full price or do I stick to the Dollar Menu and go with the McDouble. Of course, I go with the McDouble. One piece of McCheese might be better than two pieces of McCheese. I guess McDonalds thinks people like me who bought the Double Cheeseburger for a buck will pony up and pay the extra pennies. Sooner or later they will be charging for extra napkins and ketchup.\n[7] The Double Cheeseburger is priced at $1.49 and my Triple Cheeseburger was priced at $2.19. I just don't understand the point of paying 70-cents for an extra burger patty when you can just get two McDoubles for $2.00. Obviously the value of the Triple Cheeseburger makes no sense when you're comparing menu items.\n[8] The McDouble is listed as a slice of American cheese between two 100% beef patties, topped with pickles, onions, ketchup and mustard. mcdonalds.com. The Double Cheeseburger is listed as two slices of golden American cheese with two 100% all beef patties, pickles, onions, ketchup and mustard.\n[9] So whenever the McDouble hit the Dollar Menu and the Double Cheeseburger was thrown into the \"Burgers\" section at $1.19 or even higher ($1.29 in most places now), the average consumer scratched their head, winced their eyes, and fell over in a wrath of confusion and bewilderment.\n[10] The difference is that the Mighty Kid's Meal provides more food than what is typically found in a Happy Meal, providing a McDouble (a cheeseburger consisting of two patties and one slice of cheese) instead of a cheeseburger or a hamburger, and more Chicken McNuggets (6 versus 4), plus a larger drink (16oz vs 12oz).\n[11] There are many items that can be purchased at McDonald's for just $1, really, just check their dollar menu ! Here's a tip that not everyone knows... a McDouble from the McDonalds Dollar menu is the same thing as a Double Cheeseburger-well, minus one piece of cheese (and a lot of cents).\n[12] No, The McDonald's McDouble Is Not The 'Greatest Food In Human History'. McDonald's. 800. I may be a little late to this, but it is never too late to point out how stupid it is to argue that the McDonald's McDouble cheeseburger is the greatest food in human history..\n[13] A double cheesburger has 2 slices of cheese with 2 meat patties. A mcdouble on the other hand only had 1 slice of cheese, but still 2 pieces of meat. I say had because mcdoubles arent sold in Australia (maybe a few stores but not a regular menu item) anymore. Other countries might be different but that's the difference in Australia.\n[14] For me, I worked at a McDonald's in west central Wisconsin and I know some McDonald's serve different food depending on the region. Anyway, I'll just make a list of the food and how I was told to prepare it. Burgers (McDouble, Cheeseburger, Chicken sandwiches, etc.) -There is the part in the back which we referred to as the kitchen.

Speech impairments in spastic dysarthria involves four major abnormalities of voluntary movement: spasticity, weakness, limited range of motion and slowness of movement.\n[2] Dysarthria is a motor speech disorder. It results from impaired movement of the muscles used for speech production, including the lips, tongue, vocal folds, and/or diaphragm.The type and severity of dysarthria depend on which area of the nervous system is affected.ysarthria is caused by damage to the brain. This may occur at birth, as in cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy, or may occur later in life due to one of many different conditions that involve the nervous system, including. 1 stroke,\n[3] Dysarthria is a feature of many neurological diseases including cerebral palsy, stroke, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson s disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis. Dysarthria is a relatively common symptom of multiple sclerosis and can take many forms.Episodic paroxysmal dysarthria, which is where the dysarthria lasts for up to a minute or so and recurs several times a day, is particulary common in MS.ysarthria refers to speech problems that are caused by the muscles involved with speaking or the nerves controlling them. Both muscle weakness and incoordination can give rise to dysarthria. Speech problems that result from cognitive dysfunction are not dysarthria.\n[4] Types of Cerebral Palsy.

RSA encryption is a public-key encryption technology developed by RSA Data Security. The RSA algorithm is based on the difficulty in factoring very large numbers. Based on this principle, the RSA encryption algorithm uses prime factorization as the trap door for encryption. Deducing an RSA key, therefore, takes a huge amount of time and processing power. RSA is the standard encryption method for important data, especially data that's transmitted over the Internet.\n[2] Use this command to generate RSA key pairs for your Cisco device (such as a router). RSA keys are generated in pairs--one public RSA key and one private RSA key. If your router already has RSA keys when you issue this command, you will be warned and prompted to replace the existing keys with new keys.\n[3] Use this command to generate RSA key pairs for your Cisco device (such as a router).

If you generate a named key pair using the key-label argument, you must also specify the usage-keys keyword or the general-keys keyword. Named key pairs allow you to have multiple RSA key pairs, enabling the Cisco IOS software to maintain a different key pair for each identity certificate.\n[4] THE CRYPTOGRAPHY GUIDE: RSA. RSA RSA is a public key algorithm invented by Rivest, Shamir and Adleman. The key used for encryption is different from (but related to) the key used for decryption.The algorithm is based on modular exponentiation.hen talking of key lengths in connection with RSA, what is meant is the modulus length. An algorithm that uses different keys for encryption and decryption is said to be asymmetric. Anybody knowing the public key can use it to create encrypted messages, but only the owner of the secret key can decrypt them.\n[5] What is an RSA key used for? RSA key is a private key based on RSA algorithm. Private Key is used for authentication and a symmetric key exchange during establishment of an SSL/TLS session. It is a part of the public key infrastructure that is generally used in case of SSL certificates.\n[6] PEM encoded RSA private key. PEM encoded RSA private key is a format that stores an RSA private key, for use with cryptographic systems such as SSL. A public key can be derived from the private key, and the public key may be associated with one or more certificate files.\n[7] RSA makes the public key infrastructure (PKI) encryption standards by which much of the Internet's secure communication are run. Other RSA products include hardware token s, software tokens, SecurID, Besafe and enVision. RSA encryption is based on use of a public and a private key. Typically a key fob (such as an RSA SecurID security token) is used by employees in security-sensitive companies. The token generates a public key that changes every minute.\n[8] RSA (cryptosystem) For other uses, see RSA (disambiguation). RSA is one of the first practical public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission. In such a cryptosystem, the encryption key is public and differs from the decryption key which is kept secret. In RSA, this asymmetry is based on the practical difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers, the factoring problem.\n[9] RSA encryption is based on use of a public and a private key.

Often the heating, cooling and ventilation of a building are combined in the air-conditioning system.In a mechanical ventilation system the supply air and the exhaust air are transported mechanically.y controlling the ventilator it is possible to control the ventilation capacity of the system. Natural air supply with mechanical air exhaust. This is a popular form of ventilation in residential buildings and offices.\n[13] Mechanical ventilation is a life support treatment. A mechanical. ventilator is a machine that helps people breathe when they are not. able to breathe enough on their own. The mechanical ventilator is. also called a ventilator, respirator, or breathing machine. Most. patients who need support from a ventilator because of a severe. illness are cared for in a hospital's intensive care unit (ICU).\n[14] CMS IMPLEMENTED A NEW LENGTH-OF-STAY EDIT FOR.

Mechanical ventilation is often categorized based on the interface used, such as a tracheostomy tube for invasive ventilation, or a mask for non-invasive ventilation.\n[16] An energy recovery ventilator (ERV) is a type of mechanical equipment that features a heat exchanger combined with a ventilation system for providing controlled ventilation into a building.n energy recovery ventilator (ERV) is a type of mechanical equipment that features a heat exchanger combined with a ventilation system for providing controlled ventilation into a building.\n[17] What it costs: Mechanical Ventilation. Building Magazine: In many instances mechanical ventilation may be the only option to manage office environments. Peter Mayer of Building LifePlans explores the options. Although there is an emphasis on passive ventilation to minimise carbon emissions, the reality is that offices often include mechanical ventilation and space heating to create a comfortable internal environment. There are many options in the design of ventilation systems to minimise costs.\n[18] Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Treatment & Management - Mechanical Ventilation. 1 The goals of mechanical ventilation in ARDS are to maintain oxygenation while avoiding oxygen toxicity and the complications of mechanical ventilation.\n[19] You can increase the ventilation rate of your home by. opening windows, or by operating your mechanical ventilation systems.

Monotonic functions are the functions which maintained the order of functions value. As we all know that the variation in independent value also make the variation in functions value. A suitable example for this is monotonic functions or linear polynomials. The monotonic functions maintains the straight line in linear programming graph. This is also called the monotonic nature over the domain and real numbers. A monotonic function increases and decreases over the interval.\n[2] To solidify our understanding of what a monotonic function is, let's consider what a non-monotonic function is. A non-monotonic function is a function that is increasing and decreasing on different intervals of its domain. For example, consider our initial example f(x) equals x 2.\n[3] Montonic Function. When a function is increasing on its entire domain or decreasing on its entire domain, we say that the function is strictly monotonic, and we call it a monotonic function. For example, consider the function g(x) equals x 3: Notice the graph of g is increasing everywhere. Therefore, this is a monotonic function.\n[4] An important application of monotonic functions is in probability theory. If is a random variable, its cumulative distribution function is a monotonically increasing function. A function is unimodal if it is monotonically increasing up to some point (the mode) and then monotonically decreasing. When is a strictly monotonic function, then is injective on its domain, and if is the range of, then there is an inverse function on for.\n[5] Note that just monotonic transformation of a concave function isnot necessarily concave: consider, for example f (x) = x and g (z) = z 3 .Thus the concavity of a function is not ordinal, it is cardinal property.Economic ExampleSuppose production function f (x) is concave and the cost function c (x) is convex.ote that just monotonic transformation of a concave function isnot necessarily concave: consider, for example f (x) = x and g (z) = z 3 .Thus the concavity of a function is not ordinal, it is cardinal property.Economic ExampleSuppose production function f (x) is concave and the cost function c (x) is convex.\n[6] monotonic function. Monotonic Function. (or monotone function), a function whose increments \u0394f(x) = f(x\u2032) \u2212 f(x) do not change sign when \u0394x = x\u2032 \u2212 x > 0; that is, the increments are either always nonnegative or always nonpositive. Somewhat inaccurately, a monotonic function can be defined as a function that always varies in the same direction.\n[7] Monotonic Function. A monotonic function is a function which is either entirely nonincreasing or nondecreasing. A function is monotonic if its first derivative (which need not be continuous) does not change sign.\n[8] I've never heard of monotonic being used for two (input) variables, but I suppose it would mean that, for each fixed value of y, u is a monotonic function of x, and for each fixed value of x, u is a monotonic function of y (and I expect they'd need to be either both monotonic increasing or both monotonic decreasing).\n[9] In mathematics, a monotonic function (or monotone function) is a function between ordered sets that preserves or reverses the given order. This concept first arose in calculus, and was later generalized to the more abstract setting of order theory. 1 Monotonicity in calculus and analysis.\n[10] In calculus, a function defined on a subset of the real numbers with real values is called monotonic if and only if it is either entirely increasing or decreasing. It is called monotonically increasing (also increasing or nondecreasing), if for all and such that one has, so preserves the order (see Figure 1).Likewise, a function is called monotonically decreasing (also decreasing or nonincreasing) if, whenever, then, so it reverses the order (see Figure 2).If the order in the definition of monotonicity is replaced by the strict order, then one obtains a stronger requirement.A function with this property is called strictly increasing. Again, by inverting the order symbol, one finds a corresponding concept called strictly decreasing.wo facts about these functions are: 1 if is a monotonic function defined on an interval, then is differentiable almost everywhere on, i.e. the set of numbers in such that is not differentiable in has Lebesgue measure zero.\n[11] Figure 1. A monotonically increasing function (it is strictly increasing on the left and right while just non-decreasing in the middle.). Figure 2. A monotonically decreasing function. In calculus, a function f defined on a subset of the real numbers with real values is called monotonic (also monotonically increasing, increasing or non-decreasing), if for all x and y such that x \u2264 y one has f (x) \u2264 f (y), so f preserves the order (see Figure 1).\n[12] Example Sentences for monotonous. The hero may, of course, sometimes die; but not always; that would be too monotonous. The monotonous cry of the leadsman in the chains was the only sound audible. The airs generally are plaintive and monotonous, and have a sad and weary sound. The scenery of this branch was as monotonous as that of the other.\n[13] Here's the definition of the monotonic function from Wikipedia: In calculus, a function f defined on a subset of the real numbers with real values is called monotonic (also monotonically increasing, increasing or non-decreasing), if for all x and y such that x \u2264 y one has f(x) \u2264 f(y), so f preserves the order.\n[14] Two facts about these functions are: 1 if is a monotonic function defined on an interval, then is differentiable almost everywhere on, i.e. the set of numbers in such that is not differentiable in has Lebesgue measure zero. 2 if is a monotonic function defined on an interval, then is Riemann integrable.\n[15] In calculus, a function defined on a subset of the real numbers with real values is called monotonic if and only if it is either entirely increasing or decreasing. It is called monotonically increasing (also increasing or nondecreasing), if for all and such that one has, so preserves the order (see Figure 1). Likewise, a function is called monotonically decreasing (also decreasing or nonincreasing) if, whenever, then, so it reverses the order (see Figure 2).\n[16] The MONOTONIC function is often presented as a means of adding sequence numbers to table rows. Several papers present it as a solution to this programming problem. If the MONOTONIC function is used in an SQL procedure that aggregates data then the function may return non-sequential or missing results.\n[17] Monotonicity criterion. This article is about a voting system criterion. For the mathematical notion of an order preserving mapping, see monotonic function. The monotonicity criterion is a voting system criterion used to evaluate both single and multiple winner ranked voting systems.\n[18] The term monotonic may also be used to describe set functions which map subsets of the domain to non-decreasing values of the codomain. In particular, if is a set function from a collection of sets to an ordered set , then is said to be monotone if whenever as elements of , .\n[19] \u2022 MONOTONE (adjective). The adjective MONOTONE has 2 senses: 1. of a sequence or function; consistently increasing and never decreasing or consistently decreasing and never increasing in value. 2. sounded or spoken in a tone unvarying in pitch. Familiarity information: MONOTONE used as an adjective is rare.\n[20] A function f (x) is concave over a convex set if and only if the function \u2212 f (x) is a convex function over the set. A differentiable function f is concave on an interval if its derivative function f \u2032 is monotonically decreasing on that interval: a concave function has a decreasing slope. Any affine function is both (non-strictly) concave and convex. 2 The sine function is concave on the interval. 3 The function, where is the determinant of a nonnegative-definite matrix B, is concave. 4 Practical example: rays bending in computation of radiowave attenuation in the atmosphere.\nSearch Query: example of monotonic function.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Best Answer: Goldfish do not grow to the size of their tank, that is a myth. Goldfish grow until they are at their mature size, but being in a tank too small for them to grow properly can cause stunting. This is where the idea that they grow to the size of their tank comes from.\n[5] The genetics (DNA) of the goldfish parents passed on to their offspring. How fast do goldfish grow is really a tough question to answer really. As mentioned above these factors will influence the growth potential of your goldfish. For example the how clean your water is impacts how fast they will grow. If the water is too clear then lacks algae and food to feed on.\n[6] Goldfish Size and Life Expectancy.

I have seen goldfish grow ridiculously large in very small containers when their water was changed frequently. Goldfish will not grow if water conditions are poor. Fancy goldfish don't grow as large as Common goldfish. A good size would be around 5 inches body length for most fancy varieties, 8 inches for Comets and 12 inches for Common Goldfish. These sizes are usually only attained by pond grown fish.\n[8] How fast do goldfish grow is really a tough question to answer really.

You can put a maximum of only one 1 long goldfish in a one-gallon fish bowl, and it usually will not do well. If it does well, it will quickly grow too big for a fish bowl. Goldfish are not appropriate fish for fish bowls.\n[10] 'Goldfish usually grow with their environment so if they are in a large space and are fed enough, they do sometimes just keep growing.

If you want your goldfish to grow fast consider feeding them a wide variety of food. Also high growth food will help as well maximizing the growth of your goldfish.\n[18] For example, koi are larger than goldfish. They have long, lean bodies and can grow to be 2-3 feet long! Even when in the wild, goldfish grow to be no more than 1 foot long.fter all, both goldfish and koi come in a variety of colors. You may have even wondered if koi are goldfish that have gotten really big! Koi and goldfish are different types of fish, but they are both members of the carp family.\n[19] A large tank gives your goldfish plenty of room to grow to their full potential. In a small 5-gallon aquarium, your goldfish will still grow. But growth will become stunted, and your goldfish won't be able to develop properly. In such an environment, goldfish usually don't last any more than a couple of years.\n[20] If your tank is in a poorly lit area \u2013 or if you want to grow live plants \u2013 then it would be a good idea to include a light in the hood of your aquarium. If you do add a light to your aquarium then switch it off at night to replicate natural day/night cycles. Like humans, goldfish prefer to sleep in the dark.oldfish definitely do need light! Like most animals, goldfish would not be healthy if permanently kept in dull or dark conditions. Unlike some fish that live deep in the sea, wild goldfish live in lakes and rivers that are often illuminated by relatively bright daylight.\nSearch Query: do goldfish grow.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Sous vide, if you recall, is the process of cooking food in a controlled-temperature water bath, using a vacuum sealer to protect your meat from the liquid. What you get from sous vide is your food cooked to exactly the temperature you want to kill bacteria and make it safe to eat, but not overcooking it.\n[2] What kind of foods can you cook sous vide? Sous vide is traditionally seen as an alternative method for cooking meats. However, the technique is extremely versatile, meaning all manner of ingredients can be cooked such as: Pork, Lamb, Beef, Chicken, Duck, Turkey, Quail.\n[3] What is a Sous Vide Cooker? We said it before and we'll say it again: a sous vide machine is a better way to cook. When you use a sous vide at home, you'll be cooking with water. It's not at all what you're thinking. Your steak and chicken \u2013 any food really \u2013 will be placed in BPA-free, sturdy plastic bags and cooked.\n[4] Sous-vide cooking involves cooking food in sealed plastic bags immersed in hot water for long periods of time. Depending on the cut, type, and thickness of the meat or the type of food in question, cooking sous-vide for several hours is not out of the ordinary. The key is managing the temperature of the water so it stays hot enough to cook the food thoroughly and evenly, and long enough to kill any food-borne pathogens that may be in the bag along with the food.\n[5] Actually vacuum is a mis-represented concept in sous vide. Fact is, you don't need vacuum sealing entirely for sous vide cooking. If you can truly control the temperature of the water bath then all you need is to provide the food you are cooking a barrier from the water bath.\n[6] Often, however, when you prepare food sous vide you're packaging the food in plastic. (Often but not always. Eggs come in their own wrappers\u2014their shells\u2014and we can sous vide foods that set as they cook, like custard, yogurt, and chicken liver p\u00e2t\u00e9, in glass canning jars.)\n[7] The term sous vide (pronounced soo\u2013veed) is a French term, meaning under vacuum. Sous vide is a culinary technique in which vacuum-sealed food is immersed in a water bath and cooked at a very precise, consistent temperature.This cooking technique typically involves cooking food for longer periods of time at a lower temperature.he term sous vide (pronounced soo\u2013veed) is a French term, meaning under vacuum.

Sous vide recipes. From the French for 'under vacuum', sous vide is a method of cooking where ingredients are sealed in an airtight bag and submerged in a water bath. This method not only ensures a constant cooking temperature, but allows the food to cook for long periods of time without losing any of its flavour or moisture.\n[10] Slow and low is the name of the game here. Some times cooking food sous vide means hours, sometimes it means entire days. Food safety is a concern, but doesn't generally an issue as long as you stick to the temperature and cooking time specified for the food you're cooking.imply put, sous vide cooking is the process of vacuum-sealing raw food in plastic pouches and cooking it slowly in a temperature-controlled water bath.\n[11] Learn more sous vide at http://www.sousvidesupreme.com-----WHAT IS SOUS VIDE? -----The sous vide technique has been the secret of great chefs worldwide for decades.

Synaptic vesicles are structures within the synaptic knobs. b) axons c) dendrites d) synaptic knobs Correct. Synaptic knobs are located at the tip of each axon terminal.\n[2] Psychology Definition of TERMINAL BUTTON: the terminal part of an axon from which a neural signal is rendered, via dispersion of a neurotransmitter, across a synapse to a nearby neuron TERMINAL BUTTON: The terminal button is commonly referred to as the synaptic button, end button, button terminal, terminal bulb, and synaptic knob. Related Psychology Terms axon terminal\n[3] The dendrites don't have terminating knobs at the end of it. The axons are what conduct action potentials away from the cell body. The axon is not an axon because it's long, it's an axon because of the existence of synaptic knobs at the axon terminals. When the axon conducts action potentials away from the cell body and the signal goes to the synaptic knob, it's going to release a neurotransmitter in response to the electrical signal.\n[4] Axons usually have thousands of terminal branches that each end as a bulbous enlargement called a synaptic knob or synaptic terminal. Synaptic knobs contain several membrane-bounded synaptic vesicles that are 40 to 100 nanometers in diameter.\n[5] Axons often have thousands of terminal branches, each ending as a bulbous enlargement, the synaptic knob or synaptic terminal. At the synaptic knob, the action potential is converted into a chemical message which, in turn, interacts with the recipient neuron or effector. This process is synaptic transmission.\n[6] 2) Synaptic Cleft: This is the narrow gap between the axon terminal of the presynaptic neuron, and the post-synaptic membrane of another excitable cell.

From this structure chemical signals can be sent to neighboring neurons. Transmission of nerve impulse along the axon\n[14] Axons and dendrites differ in terms of structure. The term dendrite is derived from the Greek dendron, which means tree.

In molecular biology and genetics, splicing is a modification of the nascent pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) transcript in which introns are removed and exons are joined. For nuclear-encoded genes, splicing takes place within the nucleus after or concurrently with transcription.\n[2] Exons, Introns, Codons, & their equivalents. Three common technical terms in molecular genetics, exon, intron, and codon, have specific technical definitions, but are often miss-used in hurried or short-hand presentations. The main thing to remember is that exon and introns are features of DNA, whereas codons are features of RNA.\n[3] Silent Mutations are DNA mutations that do not result in a change to the amino acid sequence or a protein. They may occur in a non-coding region (outside of a gene or within an intron), or they may occur within an exon in a manner that does not alter the final amino acid chain.he word biology means, the science of life, from the Greek bios, life, and logos, word or knowledge. Therefore, Biology is the science of Living Things. That is why Biology is sometimes known as Life Science.\n[4] By definition, exons and introns are sequences in a protein-coding gene region of a double-stranded DNA molecule (dsDNA) that are expressed as proteins, or intervening sequences not so expressed. The exon and intron sequences are typicallly visualized as the Sense Strand of the dsDNA, written 5'-3', left to right.\n[5] Molecular Biology & DNA. Q: A: An intron is a nucleotide sequence found within the genes and is removed via RNA splicing when a mature RNA molecule is being generated; on the other hand, an exon is a nucleic acid sequence present in a mature messenger RNA molecule.\n[6] Muro, A.

Regulated splicing of the fibronectin EDA exon is essential for proper skin wound healing and normal lifespan. Journal of Cell Biology 162: 149\u2013160.\n[7] In molecular biology, splicing is the editing of the nascent pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) transcript. After splicing, introns are removed and exons are joined together (ligated). For nuclear-encoded genes, splicing takes place within the nucleus either co-transcriptionally or immediately after transcription.\n[8] Priya Rani Verma, 6-Years teaching experience of Biology/Biotechnology Answered Apr 5, 2016 \u00b7 Author has 126 answers and 220.6k answer views Introns and exons were discovered independently by American molecular biologists Richard Roberts and Phillip Sharp in 1977.\n[9] Exon definition may facilitate splice site selection in RNAs with multiple exons.

The average number of exons in human genes is about 8-10 and the mean value of 8.8 exons per gene. Exon lengths are distributed much more tightly (S.D.=192.23 - 396.79) than introns on each chromosome (see below).The average exon length is about 170bp.tarting with 26,564 genes, we filtered out 233,785 exons and 207,344 introns from the human genome. The results of exon (exons in the coding region) and intron (introns between the coding exons) distributions were tabulated for further analysis.\n[11] On FYTTD1 exon 7 and KIFAP3 exon 20, depletion of either SR protein had the same effect ( Figure 4C, bottom left panel). On RALY exon 4, SRSF1 depletion resulted in exon inclusion, but SRSF2 depletion induced exon skipping, and the converse was true on the MLF1 exon 3 ( Figure 4C, bottom right panel).\n[12] The 26,564 annotated genes in the human genome (build October, 2003) contain 233,785 exons and 207,344 introns. On average, there are 8.8 exons and 7.8 introns per gene. About 80% of the exons on each chromosome are r = 0.95 and r = 0.97, respectively. These results suggest their implication in genome design.tarting with 26,564 genes, we filtered out 233,785 exons and 207,344 introns from the human genome.

Description: In most eukaryotic genes, coding regions (exons) are interrupted by noncoding regions (introns). During transcription, the entire gene is copied into a pre-mRNA, which includes exons and introns.During the process of RNA splicing, introns are removed and exons joined to form a contiguous coding sequence.This mature mRNA is ready for translation.ranscrition/translation-Exons and introns.

During transcription, the entire gene is copied into a pre-mRNA, which includes exons and introns.\n[14] Exons. Exons are the nucleotide sequences of genes that are expressed, and those are found at either sides of an intron. In simple terms, it could be stated that exons really hit the ground in the expression of genes or in the protein synthesis.The polypeptide strand is formed based on the nucleotide sequence in exons. Exons are found at the two ends of a gene while introns are always found inside the gene. \u2022 When mutations take place, introns sometimes contribute nucleotides but usually not the other way around. \u2022 Both DNA and RNA contain introns and exons, but mature RNA only contain exons and not the introns.\n[15] A related antigen is Sat.

In hypertrophy the heart muscle becomes thicker. This can have different causes. Left ventricular hypertrophy results from an increase in left ventricular workload, e.g., during hypertension or aortic valve stenosis. Right ventricular hypertrophy results from an increase in right ventricular workload, e.g., emphysema or pulmonary embolization. These causes are fundamentally different from hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HCM), which is a congenital misalignment of cardiomyocytes, resulting in hypertrophy.\n[3] Ventricular hypertrophy. Ventricular hypertrophy (VH) is thickening of the walls of a ventricle (lower chamber) of the heart. Although left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is more common, right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) can also occur, as can hypertrophy of both ventricles, that is, biventricular hypertrophy (BVH). Ventricular hypertrophy can be part of various syndromes caused by any of various underlying diseases.\n[4] Left ventricular hypertrophy can occur when some factor makes your heart work harder than normal to pump blood to your body. Factors that can cause your heart to work harder include: High blood pressure (hypertension). This is the most common cause of left ventricular hypertrophy. More than one-third of people show evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy at the time of their diagnosis with hypertension. Aortic valve stenosis.\n[5] By Mayo Clinic Staff. Left ventricular hypertrophy can occur when some factor makes your heart work harder than normal to pump blood to your body. Factors that can cause your heart to work harder include: High blood pressure (hypertension). This is the most common cause of left ventricular hypertrophy. More than one-third of people show evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy at the time of their diagnosis with hypertension.\n[6] The last common cause of right ventricular hypertrophy is the ventricular septal defect. This is a disease affecting the ventricular septum. The ventricular septum, on the other hand, is the wall that divides the right and left ventricles of the heart. Symptoms of Right Ventricular Hypertrophy\n[7] Left ventricular hypertrophy is enlargement and thickening (hypertrophy) of the walls of your heart's main pumping chamber (left ventricle). Left ventricular hypertrophy can develop in response to some factor \u2014 such as high blood pressure or a heart condition \u2014 that causes the left ventricle to work harder. As the workload increases, the muscle tissue in the chamber wall thickens, and sometimes the size of the chamber itself also increases.\n[8] Right ventricular hypertrophy. Description, Causes and Risk Factors: Abbreviation: RVH. Right ventricular hypertrophy is the increase or the enlargement in the size of the right ventricle of the heart. The right ventricle is responsible for pumping blood towards the lungs. In the lungs, blood is mixed with oxygen and then pumped back to the left ventricle to be eventually distributed to the brain and to other parts of the body. There are several possible causes of right ventricular hypertrophy.\n[9] Factors that can cause your heart to work harder include: 1 High blood pressure (hypertension). This is the most common cause of left ventricular hypertrophy. More than one-third of people show evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy at the time of their diagnosis with hypertension. Aortic valve stenosis.\n[10] Ventricular hypertrophy. Ventricular hypertrophy (VH) is thickening of the walls of a ventricle (lower chamber) of the heart. Although left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is more common, right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) can also occur, as can hypertrophy of both ventricles, that is, biventricular hypertrophy (BVH).\n[11] Read More. One of the most confusing ST-elevation mimics for paramedics is the \"strain pattern\" (or repolarization abnormality) occasionally found with left ventricular hypertrophy. This is important because left ventricular hypertrophy is one of the most common causes of ST segment elevation in chest pain patients.Many 12 lead ECG classes teach paramedics to recognize the voltage [\u2026]. Cardiac Rhythm Analysis, 12-Lead ECG Interpretation, Resuscitation.his is important because left ventricular hypertrophy is one of the most common causes of ST segment elevation in chest pain patients. Many 12 lead ECG classes teach paramedics to recognize the voltage [\u2026]. Cardiac Rhythm Analysis, 12-Lead ECG Interpretation, Resuscitation.\n[12] However, some cases with less right ventricular hypertrophy than the maximal one had a more advanced associated left ventricular hypertrophy (cases 8, 10, 22, 24, 25, 26), the thickness of the left ventricular wall ranging from 15 to 20 millimeters. Left ventricular hypertrophy was absent in one case only (case 2).\n[13] Ventricular hypertrophy. Ventricular hypertrophy (VH) is thickening of the walls of a ventricle (lower chamber) of the heart.(1)(2) Although left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is more common, right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), as well as concurrent hypertrophy of both ventricles can also occur.\n[14] Left Ventricular Hypertrophy. Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH) causes a similar pattern of repolarization abnormalities as LBBB, with ST elevation in the leads with deep S-waves (usually V1-3) and ST depression/T-wave inversion in the leads with tall R waves (I, aVL, V5-6).\n[15] Lifestyle changes can help lower your blood pressure and improve left ventricular hypertrophy signs. Consider: Weight loss. Left ventricular hypertrophy is often found in obese people regardless of blood pressure. Losing weight has been shown to reverse left ventricular hypertrophy. Limiting salt in your diet.\n[16] Left ventricular hypertrophy is more common in people who have uncontrolled high blood pressure. But no matter what your blood pressure is, developing left ventricular hypertrophy puts you at higher risk for a heart attack and stroke. Treating high blood pressure can help ease your symptoms and may reverse left ventricular hypertrophy.\n[17] Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is thickening of the heart muscle of the left ventricle of the heart, that is, left-sided ventricular hypertrophy.\n[18] Ventricular hypertrophy (VH) is thickening of the walls of a ventricle (lower chamber) of the heart. Although left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is more common, right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), as well as concurrent hypertrophy of both ventricles can also occur.\n[19] The last common cause of right ventricular hypertrophy is the ventricular septal defect. This is a disease affecting the ventricular septum. The ventricular septum, on the other hand, is the wall that divides the right and left ventricles of the heart.\n[20] Ventricular hypertrophy is thickening of the walls of a ventricle of the heart. Although left ventricular hypertrophy is more common, right ventricular hypertrophy, as well as concurrent hypertrophy of both ventricles can also occur. Ventricular hypertrophy can result from a variety of conditions, both adaptive and maladaptive. For example, it occurs in what is regarded as a physiologic, adaptive process in pregnancy in response to increased blood volume; but can also occur as a consequence of v\nSearch Query: causes of left ventricular hypertrophy.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Theraderm Skin Renewal System is described as a total skincare system that may produce younger looking skin. This 5-product system is said to reduce fine lines, take care of rough skin and address sun damage. However, this system has received some low scores on consumer-driven websites that rate anti-aging products, which makes us wonder if this system does not live up to expectations.\n[2] The main ingredient in this Theraderm cream is lanolin, which is a chemical obtained from sheep's wool. Lanolin is often used in skin care products because of its ability to boost the natural moisture barrier, as well as the ability to draw moisture to the application site.\n[3] Nowadays there are many skin care brands, like Theraderm, which are actively promoted by doctors and dermatologists. This is an interesting approach, because it boosts the image of the products through the associated skin care expertise of a doctor.\n[4] In the case of Theraderm, this is taken even further, as the brand was founded by a plastic surgeon, Dr. James Beckman.

In plants xylem and phloem are the complex tissues which are the components parts of conductive system. In higher plants xylem contains tracheids, vessels (tracheae), xylem fibres(wood fibres) and xylem parenchyma (wood parenchyma).\n[2] have xylem (but not wood!) - they have small groups of vessels arranged in a circle around the outer part of the stem. You might think that large trees would have wide vessels and tracheids, so that water filters fast through the tree, but actually its the opposite. Trees have narrow vessels and tracheids so that water filters slowly up the tree. This indeed is less efficient at carrying water, but wider vessels are more likely to cavitate. In a woody plant, the trunk is almost entirely composed of vessels and tracheids. Tracheids differ from vessels in being much narrower\n[3] Tracheids and vessel elements form tube-shaped structures that provide pathways for water and minerals to travel from the roots to the leaves. While tracheids are found in all vascular plants, vessels are found only in angiosperms. Phloem is composed mostly of cells called sieve-tube cells and companion cells. These cells assist in the transport of sugar and nutrients produced during photosynthesis from the leaves to other parts of the plant. While tracheid cells are nonliving, sieve-tube and companion cells of the phloem are living.\n[4] Difference Between Tracheids and Vessels In plants xylem and phloem are the complex tissues which are the components parts of conductive system.

They allow water and other nutrients to be transported throughout the plant. Xylem is consists of two types of cells known as tracheids and vessel elements.\n[6] Summary: Vessels have perforations at the end plates while tracheids do not have end plates. Tracheids are derived from single individual cells while vessels are derived from a pile of cells. Tracheids are present in all vascular plants whereas vessels are confined to angiosperms.Tracheids are thin whereas vessel elements are wide. Tracheids have a much higher surface-to-volume ratio as compared to vessel elements.Vessels are broader than tracheids with which they are associated.Morphology of the perforation plate is different from that in tracheids.racheids are thin whereas vessel elements are wide. Tracheids have a much higher surface-to-volume ratio as compared to vessel elements. Vessels are broader than tracheids with which they are associated.

These cells assist in the transport of sugar and nutrients produced during photosynthesis from the leaves to other parts of the plant. While tracheid cells are nonliving, sieve-tube and companion cells of the phloem are living.\n[8] The most distinctive xylem cells are the long tracheary elements that transport water. Tracheids and vessel elements are distinguished by their shape; vessel elements are shorter, and are connected together into long tubes that are called vessels.Xylem also contains two other cell types: parenchyma and fibers.Xylem can be found: 1 in vascular bundles, present in non-woody plants and non-woody parts of woody plants. 2 in secondary xylem, laid down by a meristem called the vascular cambium in woody plants.n most plants, pitted tracheids function as the primary transport cells. The other type of tracheary element, besides the tracheid, is the vessel element. Vessel elements are joined by perforations into vessels. In vessels, water travels by bulk flow, as in a pipe, rather than by diffusion through cell membranes.\n[9] 13. The main cells of xylem are tracheids and vessel elements (these are only in found in angiosperms). Tracheids and vessel elements are dead cells that have lost their cytoplasm. Only their cell wall impregnated with lignin (an impermeable biopolymer) remains.3. The main cells of xylem are tracheids and vessel elements (these are only in found in angiosperms). Tracheids and vessel elements are dead cells that have lost their cytoplasm.

They allow water and other nutrients to be transported throughout the plant. Xylem is consists of two types of cells known as tracheids and vessel elements.hile tracheids are found in all vascular plants, vessels are found only in angiosperms. Phloem is composed mostly of cells called sieve-tube cells and companion cells. These cells assist in the transport of sugar and nutrients produced during photosynthesis from the leaves to other parts of the plant.\n[11] Xylem and phloem throughout the plant make up the vascular tissue system.

Xylem vessels are tubelike structures joined end to end. Tracheids are elongated narrow cells. they are dead cells.Water and minerals move upwards through vessels and tracheids. Fibres are long cells with thick walls and narrow cavities.\n[14] Tracheid of oak shows pits along the walls. It is longer than a vessel element and has no perforation plates. Tracheids are elongated cells in the xylem of vascular plants that serve in the transport of water and mineral salts.Tracheids are one of two types of tracheary elements, vessel elements being the other. Tracheids, unlike vessel elements, do not have perforation plates.racheids provide most of the structural support in softwoods, where they are the major cell type. Because tracheids have a much higher surface to volume ratio compared to vessel elements, they serve to hold water against gravity (by adhesion) when transpiration is not occurring.\n[15] Its major components include xylem parenchyma, xylem fibers, tracheids, and xylem vessels. Tracheids are one of the two types of tracheary elements of vascular plants. (The other being the vessel elements). A tracheid cell loses its protoplast at maturity. Thus, at maturity, it becomes one of the non-living components of the xylem.\n[16] While parenchyma cells do occur within what is commonly termed the xylem the more identifiable cells, tracheids and vessel elements, tend to stain red with Safranin-O. Tracheids are the more primitive of the two cell types, occurring in the earliest vascular plants.Tracheids are long and tapered, with angled end-plates that connect cell to cell. Vessel elements are shorter, much wider, and lack end plates.hile parenchyma cells do occur within what is commonly termed the xylem the more identifiable cells, tracheids and vessel elements, tend to stain red with Safranin-O. Tracheids are the more primitive of the two cell types, occurring in the earliest vascular plants.\n[17] Woody angiosperms have also vessels. The mature tracheids form a column of superposed, cylindrical dead cells whose end walls have been perforated, resulting in a continuous tube called vessel (trachea) . Tracheids are found in all vascular plants and are the only conducting elements in gymnosperms and ferns.Tracheids have Pits on their end walls.

Companies use marginal analysis as a decision-making tool to help them maximize their profits. Individuals unconsciously use marginal analysis to make a host of everyday decisions.\n[8] As fixed costs are incurred regardless of the level of activity the purpose of marginal costing is to determine what contribution is been generated (sales less variable costs). Using the previous example prepare a marginal costing profit statement for the months of May and June.\n[9] Both passive and active continental margins are located near coastlines. The main difference is that active margins are the main sites where tectonic activity takes place (lik \u2026 e earthquakes). This is because the continental shelf of active continental margins collide with an oceanic plate, creating subduction.\n[10] Active continental margins form primarily along the boundaries of plates that are actively converging and where one plate is sinking beneath the other. Active margins mark the continents that border the Pacific Ocean where oceanic plates are subducting beneath continental plates.assive continental margin: A continental margin that has a broad continental shelf, a gentle continental slope, and a pronounced continental rise; it is marked by a lack of earthquake and volcanic activity. Plates: Large sections of Earth's lithosphere separated by deep fault zones.\n[11] Making the world better, one answer at a time. Passive continental margins are not areas of convergence. There is little volcanic and earthquake activity on passive margins. Active margins are areas of convergence where one plate is descending beneath another. They are associated with volcanic and earthquake activity.\n[12] All three margins are seismically active, with volcanic activity at constructive and destructive margins. Some plate margins exhibit features of more than one of the three main types and are known as combined plate margins. See PLATE TECTONICS; and SEA-FLOOR SPREADING.\n[13] A continental margin that has a broad continental shelf, a gentle continental slope, and a pronounced continental rise is known as a passive continental margin. This type of margin experiences little, if any, volcanic or earthquake activity. The build-up of sediment is the primary activity affecting a passive margin.\n[14] Hawaiian Islands. Whilst most volcanic activity happens at plate margins, there are cases of volcanoes erupting in the middle of plates. The Hawaiian Islands are formed by volcanic activity, despite the nearest plate margin being 3,200 km away.Some geologists have suggested that a ' hot spot ' in the mantle, which remains stationary as the Pacific Plate moves over it, explains the existence of the island chain.awaiian Islands.

Contour plowing or contour farming or Contour bunding is the farming practice of plowing and/or planting across a slope following its elevation contour lines. These contour lines create a water break which reduces the formation of rills and gullies during times of heavy water run-off; which is a major cause of soil erosion.\n[2] Contour plowing is the act of farming on a hill or a contoured area. The plow follows the contours of the land horizontally helping to reduce runoff of water. This practice helps to prevent soil erosion in hilly and contoured areas by capturing the water runoff using water breaks to keep water contained. Contour plowing is also known as contour farming, and is a sustainable form of agriculture.\n[3] Definition of Contour plowing in the Definitions.net dictionary. Meaning of Contour plowing. What does Contour plowing mean? Information and translations of Contour plowing in the most comprehensive dictionary definitions resource on the web.\n[4] In contour plowing, the land is plowed across the slopes and along the contour lines. This will also reduce soil erosion and make rainwater infiltrate into the soil more than on land plowed along the slope. Terraces are more effective than contour plowing alone in minimizing soil erosion and facilitating infiltration f rainfall into the soil.\n[5] What does Contour plowing mean?

Contour plowing. Contour ploughing or contour farming is the farming practice of ploughing and/or planting across a slope following its elevation contour lines.\n[13] Contour plowing and terracing are both types of farming techniques. Contour plowing follows the natural shape of the land form without changing it whereas terracing changes the shape of the slope to develop flat areas for crop growth. Contour plowing and terracing are both types of farming techniques.\n[14] Contour plowing was a method of plowing furrows that follow the curves of the land rather than straight up and down slopes. Furrows that run up and down a slope form a channel that can quickly carry away seeds and topsoil. Contour plowing forms ridges, slows the water flow and helps save precious topsoil. LeRoy Hoffman rented farmland for his entire farming career and remembers when the government urged farmers to change their plowing methods.\n[15] Definitions for Contour plowing.

The rows form slow water run-off during rainstorms to prevent soil erosion and allow the water time to settle into the soil.\n[17] 1. They plant shelter belts of trees to break the force of the wind 2. In dry areas, instead of plowing under the natural vegetation to plant crops, farmers graze animals on the vegetation 3. On gentle slopes, plowing along the natural contours of the land or planting crops in strips helps reduce water erosion 4.\n[18] Contour Plowing & Terraces The Soil Erosion Service was one of the federal programs started in the 1930s to save the land that had been destroyed by years of wind erosion, over plowing, and over grazing. The commission taught farmers how to use terracing and contour plowing techniques to preserve the soil.\n[19] Both contour plowing and terrace farming are suitable for cultivating lands on sloping hills. Both are used to reduce soil erosion from tilled fields on slopes. In terrace farming, physical barriers (trenches, stone bunds, live hedges, or natural strips) are created along the contours to retain rain water and make it infiltrate into the soil and to minimize soil erosion.\n[20] 2016-09-28T08:13:26-04:00.
