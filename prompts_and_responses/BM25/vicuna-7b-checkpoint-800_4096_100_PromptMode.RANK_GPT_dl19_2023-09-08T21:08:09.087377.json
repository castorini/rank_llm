Normally the female flea lays about 15 to 20 eggs per day up to 600 in a lifetime.\n[6] Like many other parasites, tapeworms require a living host \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in particular, any host with a spine \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to continue their life cycles. However, a portion of their lives is spent outside of a human or animal host, typically in soil or feces. For instance, fleas in their larval stage consume the tapeworm eggs.When an animal eats the flea, tapeworm eggs are released in the system and migrate to the intestine. Animals in the wild are at particular risk.efore you think about killing tapeworm larvae in the soil, it may be helpful to understand this parasite\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life cycle and how it travels from host to host. Many types of tapeworm exist that infect humans and animals. Some are rare or nonexistent in the U.S., while others thrive around the world.\n[7] How Long Do Fleas Live. Flea Life Span. Fleas can live up to a year and a half when they have a food supply, the optimum temperature (70F to 85F), and ideal humidity (70%). In reality though, most live for an average of 2-3 months.\n[8] The whole cycle can be as quick as 20 days or can last up to one full year; this is because the flea may be in a dormant stage for a long time. The cycle can be interrupted at any stage, but some flea control methods are more effective than others depending upon the stage the flea is in.\n[9] Types of Flea Control Pesticides. Flea control products are formulated to kill fleas at various points in the flea life cycle and are available for the full range of on-pet, indoor, and outdoor use. Flea product formulations include spot-on treatments, powders, aerosols, collars, shampoos, soaps, and dips.\n[10] PROS: 1 Topical treatment for fleas, ticks and lice. 2 Active ingredient is the insect growth regulator, S-methoprene, which kills flea eggs and larvae. 3 Kills fleas, flea eggs, flea larvae, ticks and chewing lice for up to 30 days. 4 Stops the flea life cycle and kills flea eggs and larvae for up to 12 weeks.\n[11] 1 Fleas pass through a complete life cycle of four stages. made up of 50% eggs, 30% larvae, 15% pupae and only 5% biting adults. 1 Completion of the life cycle from egg to adult varies from two weeks to eight months. Normally the female flea lays about 15 to 20 eggs per day up to 600 in a lifetime.\n[12] Fleas prefer a warm, humid environment, with temperatures ranging between 70\u00c2\u00b0 and 90\u00c2\u00b0 Fahrenheit and a relative humidity of 75% or more. Under ideal conditions, the cat flea life cycle takes just 18 days, from egg to adult. Adult fleas (both male and female) require a blood meal prior to mating.\n[13] Life Cycle (Back to Top). The cat flea life cycle is one of complete metamorphosis, involving the stages of an egg, larva, pupa, and adult. This cycle usually lasts 30 to 75 days, yet may vary due to external factors, such as temperature and humidity.\n[14] After about 2 days (range 2-21 days), depending on environmental conditions, the flea egg hatches torelease a first stage flea larva. This flea larva lives in the host's environment(it is part of the environmental stage of the fleas life cycle), where it feeds on fleadroppings (flea dirt) and dander.\n[15] The flea life cycle has four stages: 1 Egg: An adult female flea can lay up to 40 eggs a day. 2 Larva: When the eggs hats, larvae emerge. 3 Pupa: Once in the cocoon, the larva begins its transformation into the adult flea. Adult flea: A fully-developed flea only emerges from its cocoon when a host is available.\n[16] The Flea Life Cycle. Fleas undergo complete metamorphosis with four stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Environmental variables influence the length of each developmental stage. Fleas prefer a warm, humid environment, with temperatures ranging between 70\u00c2\u00b0 and 90\u00c2\u00b0 Fahrenheit and a relative humidity of 75% or more.\n[17] The flea life cycle. Adult fleas spend most of their time on your dog or cat. They can live up to two years and a female will start laying eggs within two days of finding a host. The eggs that are laid by females fall off the cat or dog into the environment along with \u00e2\u0080\u0098flea dirts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (flea excrement).\n[18] Fleas go through four life cycle stages of egg, larva, pupa, and imago (adult). Adult fleas must feed on blood before they can become capable of reproduction. Flea populations are distributed with about 50% eggs, 35% larvae, 10% pupae, and 5% adults.\n[19] How Long Do Fleas Live. Flea Life Span. Fleas can live up to a year and a half when they have a food supply, the optimum temperature (70F to 85F), and ideal humidity (70%). In reality though, most live for an average of 2-3 months. Even if you remove the pets from your house for a time, the fleas can still survive for several months without feeding.\n[20] Under ideal conditions, the cat flea life cycle takes just 18 days, from egg to adult. Adult fleas (both male and female) require a blood meal prior to mating. They prefer blood from your pet, but in the absence of a canine or feline host, fleas will bite people.\nSearch Query: how long is life cycle of flea.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

The flea egg stage is the beginning of the flea cycle. This part of the flea cycle represents a little more than one third of the flea population at any given time. Depending on the temperature and humidity of the environment the egg can take from two to six days to hatch.\n[3] The life cycle of a flea can last anywhere from 20 days to an entire year.

The flea larvae spin cocoons around themselves in which they move to the last phase of the flea life cycle and become adult fleas. The larvae can remain in the cocoon anywhere from one week to one year. Temperature is one factor that determines how long it will take for the adult flea to emerge from the cocoon.\n[5] 2) The fleas life cycle discussed - the flea life cycle diagram explained in full. 2a) Fleas life cycle 1 - The adult flea lays her eggs on the host animal. 2b) Fleas life cycle 2 - The egg falls off the animal's skin and into the local environment of the host animal. 2c) Fleas life cycle 3 - The flea egg hatches, releasing a first stage (stage 1) flea larva.\n[6] The cat flea's primary host is the domestic cat, but it is also the primary flea infesting dogs in most of the world.

In general, saturated fats remain solid at room temperature and unsaturated fats remain liquid. Examples of food containing saturated fats are non-skim dairy, meat, and coconut oil.Unsaturated fats are found in nuts, vegetable oils, meat, and olives.hen there is room for more hydrogen atoms, we call the fat unsaturated. In general, saturated fats remain solid at room temperature and unsaturated fats remain liquid. Examples of food containing saturated fats are non-skim dairy, meat, and coconut oil.\n[2] Generally the science of cryogenics is when the temperature goes below that which we can reach with conventional refrigeration equipment, around 250 degrees (Fahrenheit) below zero. Many gases are liquid at these low temperatures. They can be colder, but the following list is the temperature at which these gases boil. Before their temperature can get any higher all the liquid must boil away and turn back into a gas. On Earth, none of these gases naturally exist as a liquid.\n[3] More energy is needed to separate them than short chain molecules which have only weak forces of attraction for each other. QUES: Name some of the compounds in the table and state whether the compound will be a gas, liquid, or solid state at room temperature (20oC). Hint: If the boiling point is below 20oC, then the liquid has already boiled and is a gas. What is the the boiling point trend in terms of the molecular weights of the compounds? At room temperature, the lighter alkanes are gases; the midweight alkanes are liquids; and the heavier alkanes are solids, or tars.\n[4] Most of the trans fat in the foods we eat is formed through a manufacturing process that adds hydrogen to vegetable oil, which converts the liquid into a solid fat at room temperature. This process is called hydrogenation.\n[5] Trans Fat. Most of the trans fat in the foods we eat is formed through a manufacturing process that adds hydrogen to vegetable oil, which converts the liquid into a solid fat at room temperature. This process is called hydrogenation. Partially hydrogenated oils are the major source of artificial trans fats in the food supply.\n[6] Elements can be solid, liquid, or gas at room temperature. Some periodic tables show this by use of a color code or other key. Neon is a gas at room temperature. Neon belongs to a family of elements that are all gases at room temperature. They are referred to as the noble gas family. There are eleven elements that are gaseous at room temperature. They include: hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, neon, chlorine, argon, krypton, xenon and radon. There are three elements that are liquids at room temperature and they include mercury, gallium, and bromine. The rest of the natural elements (76) are solid at room temperature.\n[7] P = vapor pressure of the pure liquid, or solvent. P = vapor pressure of the solvent in a solution. When the temperature of a liquid is below its boiling point, we can assume that the only molecules that can escape from the liquid to form a gas are those that lie near the surface of the liquid. = vapor pressure of the solvent in a solution. When the temperature of a liquid is below its boiling point, we can assume that the only molecules that can escape from the liquid to form a gas are those that lie near the surface of the liquid.\n[8] Although carbon dioxide mainly consists in the gaseous form, it also has a solid and a liquid form. It can only be solid when temperatures are below -78 o C. Liquid carbon dioxide mainly exists when carbon dioxide is dissolved in water. Carbon dioxide is only water-soluble, when pressure is maintained.t is made up of bicarbonate ions and dissolved carbon dioxide, with carbonic acid. The carbonic acid can neutralize hydroxide ions, which would increase the pH of the blood when added. The bicarbonate ion can neutralize hydrogen ions, which would cause a decrease in the pH of the blood when added.\n[9] 1 Liquid metallic hydrogen: Helium is a liquid at normal pressure and temperatures near absolute zero, a result of its high zero-point energy (ZPE), the lowest possible energy.\n[10] Confidence votes 9. Both saturated and unsaturated fats are made of two pieces, the fatty acid which is an extremely long carbon chain, and glycerol, a 3 carbon chain with hydrogen and oxygen bonded on them. They both have hydrogen bonded to their fatty acids.They are also both lipids.aturated fats are saturated with hydrogen atoms. This causes saturated fats to be solid at room temperature, for instance the fat on meat and coconut oil.

As an unsaturated oil is gradually more hydrogenated, the inserted hydrogen atoms make it firmer and more solid at room temperature.ome evidence suggests that the effects of these trans fats may be worse than saturated fats. So, as part of a healthy diet we should try to reduce the amount of foods we eat that contain hydrogenated or saturated fats and replace them with unsaturated fats.\n[13] Methane's boiling point is about 110K, compared to hydrogen's 20K. This means that both fuel and oxidizer lines can be purged with gaseous nitrogen. Liquid hydrogen lines can only be purged with helium, as hydrogen's boiling point is below the melting point of other inert gases.\n[14] HCl molecules, for example, have a dipole moment because the hydrogen atom has a slight positive charge and the chlorine atom has a slight negative charge. Because of the force of attraction between oppositely charged particles, there is a small dipole-dipole force of attraction between adjacent HCl molecules.The dipole-dipole interaction in HCl is relatively weak; only 3.3 kJ/mol.(The covalent bonds between the hydrogen and chlorine atoms in HCl are 130 times as strong.) The force of attraction between HCl molecules is so small that hydrogen chloride boils at -85.0 o C. Dipole-Induced Dipole Forces.nduced Dipole-Induced Dipole Forces. Neither dipole-dipole nor dipole-induced forces can explain the fact that helium becomes a liquid at temperatures below 4.2 K. By itself, a helium atom is perfectly symmetrical.\n[15] Evaporation may occur when the partial pressure of vapor of a substance is less than the equilibrium vapour pressure. Boiling is a phase transition from the liquid phase to gas phase that occurs at or above the boiling temperature. Boiling, as opposed to evaporation, occurs below the surface.vaporation is a phase transition from the liquid phase to vapor (a state of substance below critical temperature and critical pressure) that occurs at temperatures below the boiling temperature at a given pressure. Evaporation usually occurs on the surface.\n[16] Unsaturated vegetable oils tend to be liquid at room temperature, but they can also be 'hardened', through a chemical process called hydrogenation, to make them solid at room temperature.\n[17] Hydrogen Bonding Water is a liquid at room temperature due to the presence of hydrogen bonds between water molecules. The state of a molecule is determined by intermo \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 lecular forces, such as dipole-dipole interactions, Van der Waals forces (also called London dispersion forces), and hydrogen bonds.t 4oC the density is approximately 1000 kg/m3 (or 1 g/cm3) - more acurately though the density would be 999.97 kg/m3 (or \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 0.9997 g/cm3). Values for the density of pure water (H2O) have been calculated over a wide range of temperatures. At room temperature (22oC) The density of water is 997.77 kg/m3 (or 0.99777 g/cm3).\n[18] The gas cools and loses energy which forces the particles-hydrogen and oxygen in the case of water-to change state from a gas to a liquid. Liquid to Solid: When water as a liquid turns to water as a solid (ice) it goes through the process of freezing. The liquid cools below the freezing point and loses energy.\n[19] Mixtures also tend to melt at temperatures below the melting points of the pure solids. When a liquid is heated, it eventually reaches a temperature at which the vapor pressure is large enough that bubbles form inside the body of the liquid. This temperature is called the boiling point. Once the liquid starts to boil, the temperature remains constant until all of the liquid has been converted to a gas.\n[20] Saturated fats are saturated with hydrogen atoms. This causes saturated fats to be solid at room temperature, for instance the fat on meat and coconut oil.

Freshwater lakes freeze over,\n[2] While below 4 \u00c2\u00b0C the breakage of hydrogen bonds due to heating allows water molecules to pack closer despite the increase in the thermal motion (which tends to expand a liquid), above 4 \u00c2\u00b0C water expands as the temperature increases. Water near the boiling point is about 4% less dense than water at 4 \u00c2\u00b0C (39 \u00c2\u00b0F).\n[3] Although carbon dioxide has a greater molecular mass than water, water is a liquid at room temperature while carbon dioxide is a gas because of the strong intermolecular \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 forces that hold water molecules together.

Polyunsaturated oils are liquid at room temperature and in the refrigerator. 2 Common sources of polyunsaturated fat are safflower, sesame and sunflower seeds, corn and soybeans, many nuts and seeds, and their oils. 3 Monounsaturated oils are liquid at room temperature but start to solidify at refrigerator temperatures.\n[10] Nearly 10 percent is composed of helium. A very small fraction of the atmosphere is made up of compounds such as ammonia, sulfur, methane, and water vapor.

Many gases are liquid at these low temperatures. They can be colder, but the following list is the temperature at which these gases boil. Before their temperature can get any higher all the liquid must boil away and turn back into a gas.

This colorless gas or liquid is the principal industrial source of fluorine, often in the aqueous form as hydrofluoric acid, and thus is the precursor to many important compounds including pharmaceuticals and polymers (e.g. Teflon).F is widely used in the petrochemical industry and is a component of many superacids. Hydrogen fluoride boils near room temperature, while other hydrogen halides evaporate at much lower temperatures. Unlike other hydrogen halides, HF is lighter than air and diffuses relatively quickly through porous substances.\nSearch Query: hydrogen is a liquid below what temperature.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

It is very volatile, readily producing flammable and toxic concentrations at room temperature. Hydrogen cyanide gas mixes well with air, and explosive mixtures are easily formed.\n[4] Sunflower oil is also sometimes hydrogenated, a process by which hydrogen is added to oils to change their texture. The chemical process of hydrogenation produces saturated fats, while partial hydrogenation produces trans fats. In both cases, hydrogenation allows liquid oils to stay solid at room temperature.\n[5] Liquid water is exceptional in having approximately as many hydrogen bonds as it has covalent bonds. Shown right is the number of hydrogen bonds per water molecule as the temperature rises with the line-width showing the approximate disparity between different experimental methods (data from [ 2264 ]).uch cooperativity is a fundamental property of liquid water where hydrogen bonds are up to 250% stronger than the single hydrogen bond in the dimer [ 77 ]. A strong base at the end of a chain may strengthen the bonding further.\n[6] Hydrogen Bonding and Water. Hydrogen bonds account for some important qualities of water. Even though a hydrogen bond is only 5% as strong as a covalent bond, it's enough to stabilize water molecules. 1 Hydrogen bonding causes water to remain liquid over a wide temperature range. 2 Because it takes extra energy to break hydrogen bonds, water has an unusually high heat of vaporization. Water has a much higher boiling point than other hydrides. There are many important consequences of the effects of hydrogen bonding between water molecules: Hydrogen bonding makes ice less dense than liquid water, so ice floats on water.\n[7] In my experiment I will be freezing liquids, milk, raspberry lemonade, diet Pepsi, and water. Each of those liquids freezes and I will be melting them to see if what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in them effects how fast they melt. When a solid melts to a liquid it goes through a phase change called melting.The normal freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius, so if the temperature is above that then ice will melt.In order to see if what is in my liquids affects how fast they melt, I found out what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s is in them.Water is hydrogen and oxygen and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about it, but 1% milk is made out of protein, sugar, salt, fat, milk and vitamins A and D.

While it is true that pure water ice always begins to melt at 0\u00c2\u00b0C, liquid water-even pure water-does not necessarily freeze at this temperature, and can remain a liquid at much colder temperatures (see the link below).\n[16] For example to the boiling temperature. This extra forces holding the water molecules together means that water stays liquid at room temperature whereas other very similar molecules that don't form hydrogen bonds are gaseous. This is why life on earth is water based rather than, say, hydrogen sulfide based.\n[17] Saturated fats are solid at room temperature, while unsaturated fats are liquid at room temperature.

Deep in the depths of the body of Saturn, the hydrogen is then under tremendous pressure, and is transformed to liquid metallic hydrogen.\n[2] Gas to Liquid: Water change from a gas (water vapor) to a liquid through the process of condensation. The gas cools and loses energy which forces the particles-hydrogen and oxygen in the case of water-to change state from a gas to a liquid.Liquid to Solid: When water as a liquid turns to water as a solid (ice) it goes through the process of freezing. The liquid cools below the freezing point and loses energy.ydrogen and oxygen are elements. What that really means is that when an atom, the fundamental unit that makes up everything, has 1 proton (a positively charged sub-atomic particle) it is a hydrogen atom, and when it has 8 protons, it is an oxygen atom. Hydrogen gas is two hydrogen atoms bonded together, H 2.\n[3] Atmosphere. The composition of Jupiter's atmosphere is similar to that of the sun\u00e2\u0080\u0094mostly hydrogen and helium. Deep in the atmosphere, the pressure and temperature increase, compressing the hydrogen gas into a liquid. At depths about a third of the way down, the hydrogen becomes metallic and electrically conducting.he composition of Jupiter's atmosphere is similar to that of the sun\u00e2\u0080\u0094mostly hydrogen and helium. Deep in the atmosphere, the pressure and temperature increase, compressing the hydrogen gas into a liquid. At depths about a third of the way down, the hydrogen becomes metallic and electrically conducting.\n[4] Not all gases are flammable. eg carbon dioxide, nitrogen or helium. Flammable gases are those which react easily with oxygen in the air to cause combustion... such as hydrogen, methane or propane etc. Even flammable liquids are flammable only because they give off a flammable gas at temperatures below. Gasoline evaporates at room temperature into a mixture of flammable gases which are far more flammable than the liquid itself.\n[5] Examples include butane, acetylene, methane and hydrogen. Flammable liquids are identified as liquids that have a flashpoint (minimum temperature needed for the liquid to produce a vapor with enough of a concentration to ignite) below 100 degrees Fahrenheit (F). There is an exception to this definition. If any of the components of the mixture have flashpoints of 100 deg. F or higher, then the material is classified as combustible rather than flammable. Another way to identify flammable liquids is by class. It is important to remember that with flammable liquids that it is the vapor coming off of the liquid that will ignite and burn, not necessarily the liquid itself.\n[6] Hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless gas. Its density is the lowest of any chemical element, 0.08999 grams per liter. By comparison, a liter of air weighs 1.29 grams, 14 times as much as a liter of hydrogen. Hydrogen changes from a gas to a liquid at a temperature of -252.77\u00c2\u00b0C (-422.99\u00c2\u00b0F) and from a liquid to a solid at a temperature of -259.2\u00c2\u00b0C (-434.6\u00c2\u00b0F). It is slightly soluble in water, alcohol, and a few other common liquids.\n[7] What non-metals are solids or liquids or gases in room temperature? Non metal elements that are gases at room temperature are: Hydrogen, H2; Nitrogen, N2; Oxygen, O2; Fluorine, F2; Chlorine, Cl2; Helium, He; Neon, Ne; Argon, Ar; Krypton, Kr; \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Xenon, Xe; Radon, Rn. Bromine, Br2, is a liquid. 7 people found this useful. Answered.\n[8] Ice is the solid form that liquid water takes when it is cooled below 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit). Ice melts due to the chemical properties of water. There are more hydrogen bonds between the molecules of ice than in water. Ice begins to melt when its temperature exceeds 0 degrees Celsius and hydrogen bonds between water molecules break.\n[9] BUT, because the concentration of hydrogen ions in water is ALWAYS the same as the concentration of hydroxide ions in water, liquid water will ALWAYS be neutral! The table below gives the value for the ion product for water, Kw, at various temperatures.\n[10] Mercury and water are both liquid at room temperature and 1 atmosphere of pressure. You can make water boil, however, by putting it in a vacuum! Boiling is the process of a substance changing from liquid to gas phase.or Hydrogen, the boiling point is -253 degrees Celsius; for Mercury it is 357 degrees Celsius, and for Iron it is 2,750 degrees Celsius. From these numbers you can see that at room temperature (and indeed for nearly any temperature found on Earth) Hydrogen is a gas, Mercury is a liquid, and Iron is a solid.\n[11] Hydrogen can exist as a liquid under high pressure and an extremely low temperature of 20.28 kelvin (\u00e2\u0088\u0092252.87\u00c2\u00b0C, \u00e2\u0088\u0092423.17 \u00c2\u00b0F). Hydrogen is often stored in this way as liquid hydrogen takes up less space than hydrogen in its normal gas form. Liquid hydrogen is also used as a rocket fuel.ydrogen is found in large amounts in giant gas planets and stars, it plays a key role in powering stars through fusion reactions. Hydrogen is one of two important elements found in water (H 2 O). Each molecule of water is made up of two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom.\n[12] Hydrogen is found naturally in the molecular H2 form. To exist as a liquid, H2 must be cooled below hydrogen's critical point of 33 K. However, for hydrogen to be in a fully liquid state without boiling at atmospheric pressure, it needs to be cooled to 20.28 K (\u00e2\u0088\u0092423.17 \u00c2\u00b0F/\u00e2\u0088\u0092252.87 \u00c2\u00b0C).\n[13] Some chemical and physical properties of the cyanides likely to be involved in an industrial accident or terrorist attack include: Hydrogen cyanide (AC) is a pale blue or colorless liquid below 78\u00c2\u00b0 F and a colorless gas at higher temperatures.\n[14] Rating Newest Oldest.

However liquid hydrogen requires cryogenic storage and boils around 20.268 K (\u00e2\u0088\u0092252.882 \u00c2\u00b0C or \u00e2\u0088\u0092423.188 \u00c2\u00b0F). Hence, its liquefaction imposes a large energy loss (as energy is needed to cool it down to that temperature).\n[16] Hydrogen is the lightest, simplest and most commonly found chemical element in the Universe, making up around 75% of its elemental mass. Hydrogen is found in large amounts in giant gas planets and stars, it plays a key role in powering stars through fusion reactions.Hydrogen is one of two important elements found in water (H 2 O). Each molecule of water is made up of two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom.In 1766, during an acid metal reaction, Henry Cavendish first formally recognized hydrogen.In 1781 he also found that hydrogen produces water when burned.ydrogen can exist as a liquid under high pressure and an extremely low temperature of 20.28 kelvin (\u00e2\u0088\u0092252.87\u00c2\u00b0C, \u00e2\u0088\u0092423.17 \u00c2\u00b0F). Hydrogen is often stored in this way as liquid hydrogen takes up less space than hydrogen in its normal gas form. Liquid hydrogen is also used as a rocket fuel.\n[17] Even though a hydrogen bond is only 5% as strong as a covalent bond, it's enough to stabilize water molecules. Hydrogen bonding causes water to remain liquid over a wide temperature range. Because it takes extra energy to break hydrogen bonds, water has an unusually high heat of vaporization. Water has a much higher boiling point than other hydrides. There are many important consequences of the effects of hydrogen bonding between water molecules: 1 Hydrogen bonding makes ice less dense than liquid water, so ice floats on water. 2 The effect of hydrogen bonding on heat of vaporization helps make perspiration an effective means of lowering temperature for animals.\n[18] \u00c2\u00b7 H2O molecules are cohesive; they form hydrogen bonds with each other. \u00c2\u00b7 Organisms depend on the cohesion of water molecules. \u00c2\u00b7 H2O molecules are adhesive; they form hydrogen bonds with polar surfaces. \u00c2\u00b7 Water is a liquid at normal physiological (or body) temperatures.

You can see that life on Earth survives on what is essentially only a drop in the bucket of Earth's total water supply!\n[4] Only offspring with the bb genotype will have the white-flower phenotype. Therefore, in this cross, you would expect three out of four (75 percent) of the offspring to have purple flowers and one out of four (25 percent) to have white flowers.n the cross shown in Figure above, you can see that one out of four offspring (25 percent) has the genotype BB, one out of four (25 percent) has the genotype bb, and two out of four (50 percent) have the genotype Bb. These percents of genotypes are what you would expect in any cross between two heterozygous parents.\n[5] What is the sales tax rate in Louisiana? The aggregate rate of state sales tax is 5%, which consists of four point ninety seven percent (4.97%) Louisiana sales tax and point zero three percent (.03%) Louisiana Tourism Promotion District sales tax.\n[6] What is Drunk Driving / DUI? A person is considered to be driving under the influence of alcohol if their blood alcohol content (BAC) is .08 percent or higher. While each state has final say over what BAC is considered intoxicated, .08 percent is the federal standard. A persons BAC is calculated primarily through three types of tests: breath tests, blood tests and urine tests. Each of these tests has limitations and all are capable of error.\n[7] What they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell you is that the parts to repair it are about three times as expensive and in the long run you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not saving anything.

Questions often asked, and today I will answer those questions.\n[13] What is correct, however, is that at certain moments in anyone's life, such as when we are simply at rest and thinking, we may be using only 10 percent of our brains. It turns out though, that we use virtually every part of the brain, and that [most of] the brain is active almost all the time, Gordon adds. Let's put it this way: the brain represents three percent of the body's weight and uses 20 percent of the body's energy..\n[14] What Is the Normal A1c Range? The A1C is a blood test that measures the average level of extra glucose in a person's blood over the past two to three months. A1C results are expressed as the percentage of the hemoglobin molecules that have glucose bound to them. A person without diabetes produces enough insulin to maintain an A1C between 4 percent and 6 percent.\n[15] It is unexpected and somewhat inconceivable that less than three percent of Earth's water is fresh water. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, most of that three percent is inaccessible. Over 68 percent of the fresh water on Earth is found in icecaps and glaciers, and just over 30 percent is found in ground water. Only about 0.3 percent of our fresh water is found in the surface water of lakes, rivers, and swamps. Of all the water on Earth, more than 99 percent of Earth's water is unusable by humans and many other living things!\n[16] Rates of obesity now exceed 35 percent in three states (Arkansas, West Virginia and Mississippi), 22 states have rates above 30 percent, 45 states are above 25 percent, and every state is above 20 percent.

Canola oil is used in cooking, as well as biofuels. In North Dakota, genetically modified canola has been found growing far from any planted fields, raising questions about what will happen when escaped. GE canola competes with wild plants.\n[18] The Internal Revenue Service charges interest when you owe taxes and penalties on your federal tax return. The amount of interest the IRS charges on a tax liability changes quarterly. See below for the most current IRS interest rates. Beginning April 1, 2015, the interest rates for the IRS are:1 three (3) percent for overpayments [two (2) percent in the case of a corporation]; 2 three (3) percent for underpayments; 3 five (5) percent for large corporate underpayments; and.eginning April 1, 2015, the interest rates for the IRS are: 1 three (3) percent for overpayments [two (2) percent in the case of a corporation]; 2 three (3) percent for underpayments;\n[19] On how much to tip your Uber driver Well the standard tip for a taxi is 15 to 20 percent. And that is my initial reaction: I would say tip 15 to 20 percent of the fare. But things get really dicey with Uber because they have dynamic pricing. What might be a $40 ride to the airport at three in the afternoon could be a $150 ride at peak time. Do you tip 20 percent on $150?\n[20] Think about how close you are to the couple or to their parents and your own budget.

The federal government's Digital Analytics Program (DAP) has found that Windows is the most popular end-user operating system with 58.4 percent of all government web site visitors. What's more interesting though is what versions of Windows we're using and what's number two and three behind Windows. The government's data, derived from 1.39 billion web visits to more than 37 government agencies over the last 90 days, reveals that the second place operating system is Apple iOS with 16.4 percent. It's followed close by Android with 13.9 percent.\n[2] Opinions differ over what constitutes a safe number of executives on the same flight. 40 percent of companies limit the number to three or four. 33 percent allow more than 10 employees to travel together. 13 percent limit the number to five or six. 8 percent limit the number to one or two, and an equal percentage say seven or eight is acceptable.\n[3] This is a false assumption.

The three levels are bulls at 1,700 pounds, 2,000 pounds and 2,300 pounds. The daily maintenance or zero-weight-gain ration (hay or grass) varies by the size of the bull. A 1,700-pound bull needs a daily intake of 33 pounds of dry matter that is 7 percent protein and 46 percent total digestible nutrients (TDN).\n[7] After three years, 0.4 percent of the tax will remain to fund road projects. The sales tax in Sedgwick County will climb from 6.3 percent to 7.3 percent, which is what it was for the 30 months from July 1, 2005, to Dec. 31, 2007, when the 1-cent countywide sales tax to finance Intrust Bank Arena was in effect.\n[8] It is not that shoppers are spending less than they should on food in general. We spend 17 percent of our food shopping dollars on refined grains (more than three times what is recommended). \u00e2\u0080\u00a6And while the USDA recommends spending less than 1 percent on sugar and candies, most Americans spend closer to 14 percent of their food budget on sweets.\n[9] Improper payment rates are in the 20 to 25 percent range in the tax credit program -- but are 10 percent or less in the other three programs. So, even the average among the four programs would be far less than what Johnson claimed.\n[10] So if you paid $400,000 upfront and lived in the village for 12 years with a three percent DMF fee, you would pay 10 times three percent, or 30 percent of $400,000 ($120,000) as your DMF. In effect, this means your \u00e2\u0080\u0098rent' was $10,000 per year or $190 per week.he benefit is that you know what your weekly expenses are going to be in advance, not only for the next 12 months but well into the distant future. The second cost of living in a village community is the Departure Management Fee (DMF).

While a rose is a rose is a rose, not all fats are the same. There are three kinds of fat -- saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated -- and foods contain a mixture of all three. Butter, for example, is 65 percent saturated, 4 percent polyunsaturated, and 30 percent monounsaturated fat.

Endometriosis is a condition in which the lining of the uterus (endometrium) grows outside the uterus. The lining can attach to the ovaries, fallopian tubes, intestines or other structures in the pelvis. Adenomyosis occurs when tissue from the lining of the uterus grows in the muscle of the uterus. Endometriosis may cause pelvic pain, especially during menstruation. Hormones of the menstrual cycle cause the endometriosis to bleed each month. This can be painful and result in the formation of pelvic adhesions, also known as scar tissue. Blood trapped in the ovary can build up into a cyst.\n[5] Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of a woman's pelvic organs.

With right lower back pain both the link between the Sacrum and the Pelvis is the most likely cause. The imbalances in the pelvis create tension on the Sacro-Iliac joint and hence pain occurs. To ease this pain and build strength ion the area you need to use technqiues that work well and quickly.\n[10] Any of these events can cause adhesions to form, which may later cause chronic pelvic pain.

It depends on the type of shark, most sharks like living in warm or tropical waters,such as Hawaii and Australia.Some sharks though can live in colder waters,such as the Greenland shark and the Great White shark.The Great White Shark has even been seen in the cold waters of Sanfransisco.\n[2] Tiger shark Facts. Tiger shark is one of the largest species of sharks on the planet. This animal can be found in the warm, tropical and subtropical waters all over the world. Largest population of tiger sharks lives in Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia.\n[3] Smell is probably the most important shark sense, so much so that sharks have been referred to as swimming noses [source: SeaWorld]. There are some impressive statistics to back this up, too. A shark can sniff out fish extracts that make up only one part for every 10 billion parts [source: Elasmodiver]. Other research shows sharks are able to respond to one part blood for every one million parts of water; this is like being able to smell one teaspoon of something in a swimming pool [source: Shark Trust]. What's more, sharks can smell these small amounts from hundreds of meters away [source: SeaWorld].\n[4] Whale sharks live in warm waters and tropical oceans around the world. It is restricted to around +- 30 degrees of latitude.hale sharks live in warm waters and tropical oceans around the world. It is restricted to around +- 30 degrees of latitude.\n[5] Basking Shark. The Basking Shark is the second largest or biggest shark. It is found in temperate and warm oceans of the world. The behavior of Basking shark toward human divers is friendly and they never attack on human divers. It feeds on zoo plankton and on small fishes.\n[6] Nothing to Turn Your Nose Up At. The notion that the mighty great white can smell blood from a great distance has been central to modern shark mythology. Indeed, sharks do possess some of the most amazing olfactory capabilities in the natural world. Smell is so vital to a shark that two-thirds of its brain is devoted to it. They can detect some scents at concentrations as low as 1 part per 25 million, which translates to about a third of a mile away in the open ocean.\n[7] These sharks are unique in their ability to elevate and maintain body temperatures as much as 13 C above the ambient water temperature. One striking feature of these warm-bodied sharks is that their flanks and viscera are warm, while the heart and gills are at environmental temperatures.\n[8] Lately, GPS systems have brought a new way to track migration and how long do sharks live, providing more accurate information about them. Shark lifespan vary by kind and it is very different for each of them. While many types live 20 to 30 years in the wild, there are some types that live much longer than others.ately, GPS systems have brought a new way to track migration and how long do sharks live, providing more accurate information about them.

The bull shark is known for its aggressive nature, predilection for warm shallow water, and presence in brackish and freshwater systems including estuaries and rivers. Bull sharks can thrive in both salt and fresh water and can travel far up rivers. They have been known to travel up the Mississippi River as far as Alton, Illinois, although few freshwater human-shark interactions have been recorded.\n[5] It is unknown how long whale sharks can live, however, scientists believe they can live approximately 60-100 years. Whale sharks are found in all tropical and warm-temperate seas around the world, preferring water temperatures of 20-25\u00c2\u00b0C.\n[6] The shark's nose may work so well because it doesn't have to do anything else. Sharks use their noses just for smelling. Breathing is accomplished with a shark's gills, and the shark's sense of smell is not connected to its mouth in any way. Sharks often don't know how something is going to taste until they've taken a bite. This is how some people are able to escape from a shark attack -- the shark gets a little nibble of a foot and decides to reject the prey. Can sharks hear as well as they smell?

The first sharks lived in our oceans about 300 million years ago.\n[5] In some sharks, these sensitive cells can detect even the slightest traces of blood in the water. A great white shark, for example, would be able to detect a single drop of blood in an Olympic-size pool.

Best Answer: Whales, seals, dolphins, and otters are mammals (warm blooded creatures that give birth to live young. Some sharks give live birth, some eggs, and some are eggs in the uterus, but are born live. Seals find a nice beach and give birth to their pups there.ut whales, dolphins and otters (I'm supposing it's sea otters you're talking about) give birth in water. Although their babies are born in water and can swim, they need adults to help them to the surface to breathe. As for sharks, most lay eggs, but some do give live birth.\n[2] For many people, sharks are the epitome of the 'cold-blooded killer'. The warm-bodied mackerel sharks are spectacular reminders that many of our stereotypes are inaccurate. As apex predators, sharks are absolutely essential to the health and vigor of marine ecosystems.\n[3] HOW DO SHARKS BREATHE? Beneath the gills are tiny blood vessels that extract oxygen out of the water as it passes over them. Most shark species breathe by swimming with their mouths open which allows the water to pass over the gills. Some sharks like nurse, angel and lemon sharks have strong neck muscles that pump water over the gills, allowing the shark to breathe while resting on the ocean bottom. Sharks are fish, and therefore breathe through the use of\n[4] Powerful Sense of Smell. The strongest sense for a shark is their smell. It is a common myth though that sharks can smell blood miles away and then they will find the person or animal that it is coming from. While sharks can smell blood, it often indicates to them that there is wounded prey they can easily overpower. It may surprise you to learn that the nostrils on a shark aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t used for smelling. In fact, they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even attached to their mouths. It isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t an instinct of killing that the blood is going to create in them. In fact, if they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hungry then they won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even bother to look for the source of the smell. Some of the species though can smell and indicate even a single drop of blood in the water. This is just an example of how powerful their sense of smell really is.\n[5] Meat refers to the meat of warm-blooded animals. Beef, pork, venison, chicken, turkey, lamb, etc. are all considered meat by the Church. The Church does not consider cold-blooded animals to be meat.

Shortfin Mako (Isurus oxyrinchus) A question came across SHARK-L concerning makos being considered warm-blooded and various replies touch upon aspects of the topic. I responded to the original query and went onto expand upon or correct some of those responses.\n[6] Regardless sharks are cold blooded, they live either in warm, temperate and cold waters. Some species live mainly in cold waters, while some others prefer warmer waters. SHARK MIGRATION. One thing is for sure; sharks migrate to find new sources of food and they can travel up to hundreds of miles to do that. Most species of sharks live in the oceans. However, some of them are known to dwell in bodies of freshwater, like the bull shark which travels up to 4,000 Km up the Amazon River. Sometimes, sharks reach freshwater bodies; this could be the result of the destruction of their habitat by human activities.\n[7] They could be either predators (e.g. Killer whale) or filter feeders. Whales are long lived mammals with a lifespan of 70 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 100 years. Differences between Shark and Whale. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Sharks are fish and cold-blooded, whereas whales are warm-blooded mammals.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Sharks have a cartilaginous skeleton, but it is a bony skeleton in whales. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Whales are generally larger in body size than sharks.\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Whales have lungs sharks have gills for breathing. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 The body of the whale is covered with hair but shark has dermal denticles covering the skin.hey could be either predators (e.g. Killer whale) or filter feeders. Whales are long lived mammals with a lifespan of 70 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 100 years. Differences between Shark and Whale. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Sharks are fish and cold-blooded, whereas whales are warm-blooded mammals.\n[8] These sharks can raise their temperature about th\u00e2\u0080\u00a6e temperature of the water; they need to have occasional short bursts of speed in hunting Cold blooded although if you've ever seen a Great White Shark hunt sea lions you'd be thinking they would have to be hotblooded. Actually the Salmon Shark is a warm blooded shark.\n[9] Are White Sharks warm-blooded or cold-blooded? White sharks are part of the fish family, so they must be 'cold-blooded', right? Actually, white sharks are much more complex than you may think. An animal that is 'cold-blooded' means their inside body temperature is dependent on the environment they are in. For example, a snake is cold blooded, so its body temperature fluctuates with the day or even whether or not they are in the sun.\n[10] Some fish are ectothermic such as the Blue shark whereas others are endothermic such as swordfish and Lamnid sharks.ndothermic = warm-blooded Ectothermic = cold-blooded Endotherms are able to maintain their own body temperature, whereas Ectotherms rely on their environment to regulate body \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 temperature.\n[11] These sharks are unique in their ability to elevate and maintain body temperatures as much as 13 C above the ambient water temperature. One striking feature of these warm-bodied sharks is that their flanks and viscera are warm, while the heart and gills are at environmental temperatures.\n[12] Most sharks are cold-blooded. Some, like the Mako and the Great white shark, are partially warmblooded (they are endotherms). These sharks can raise their temperature about the temperature of the water; they need to have occasional short bursts of speed in hunting.\n[13] Certain lamnid sharks, tuna and billfishes are also endothermic. In common parlance, endotherms are characterized as warm-blooded .. The opposite of endothermy is ectothermy, although there is no absolute or clear separation between the nature of endotherms and ectotherms in general.\n[14] Gruber: Mackerel sharks, including great whites, makos, threshers, and porbeagles, have a heat-conserving mechanism known as the rete mirabile (wonderful net), a structure for warming blood passing over the gills.\n[15] While most sharks prefer warm or temperate water, one shark is built to withstand extreme cold. The Greenland shark lives in the northernmost waters of any shark \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the icy seas of the Arctic Circle, where water temperatures can drop to 30\u00c2\u00b0 Fahrenheit.\n[16] Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: Whales, seals, dolphins, and otters are mammals (warm blooded creatures that give birth to live young. Some sharks give live birth, some eggs, and some are eggs in the uterus, but are born live. Seals find a nice beach and give birth to their pups there.ut whales, dolphins and otters (I'm supposing it's sea otters you're talking about) give birth in water. Although their babies are born in water and can swim, they need adults to help them to the surface to breathe. As for sharks, most lay eggs, but some do give live birth.\n[17] For many people, sharks are the epitome of the 'cold-blooded killer'. The warm-bodied mackerel sharks are spectacular reminders that many of our stereotypes are inaccurate. As apex predators, sharks are absolutely essential to the health and vigor of marine ecosystems.\n[18] HOW DO SHARKS BREATHE? Beneath the gills are tiny blood vessels that extract oxygen out of the water as it passes over them. Most shark species breathe by swimming with their mouths open which allows the water to pass over the gills. Some sharks like nurse, angel and lemon sharks have strong neck muscles that pump water over the gills, allowing the shark to breathe while resting on the ocean bottom. Sharks are fish, and therefore breathe through the use of\n[19] Powerful Sense of Smell. The strongest sense for a shark is their smell. It is a common myth though that sharks can smell blood miles away and then they will find the person or animal that it is coming from. While sharks can smell blood, it often indicates to them that there is wounded prey they can easily overpower. It may surprise you to learn that the nostrils on a shark aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t used for smelling. In fact, they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even attached to their mouths. It isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t an instinct of killing that the blood is going to create in them. In fact, if they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hungry then they won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even bother to look for the source of the smell. Some of the species though can smell and indicate even a single drop of blood in the water. This is just an example of how powerful their sense of smell really is.\n[20] The bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas), also known as the Zambezi shark or, unofficially, as Zambi in Africa and Nicaragua shark in Nicaragua, is a requiem shark commonly found worldwide in warm, shallow waters along coasts and in rivers.he bull shark is a special case in evolutionary history. Some of its closest living relatives do not have the capabilities of osmoregulation. The bull shark's genus, Carcharhinus, is shared by the sand bar shark that is not capable of osmoregulation.\nSearch Query: how are some sharks warm blooded.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

It is parallel to the bases of the trapezoid. The length of the midsegment is the average of the lengths of the two bases. Remember that the bases of a trapezoid are parallel. Key Curriculum Press can provide demo versions of Geometer's Sketch Pad.\n[3] A trapezoid midsegment connects the midpoints of the two congruent sides of the trapezoid, and is parallel to the pair of parallel sides. The length of the midsegment is the sum of the two bases divided by 2. Remember that the bases of a trapezoid are the two parallel sides. To find angles within a trapezoid, remember that since there are two sides are parallel, the other sides can be seen as transversals, forming corresponding angles and same side interior angles.\n[4] The midsegment of a trapezoid has two special properties: 1 The midsegment of a trapezoid is parallel to each base. 2 The length of the midsegment of a trapezoid is equal to half the sum of the lengths of its bases.\n[5] The side of the triangle that the midsegment does not intersect is the base of the triangle.

The price differences between a McDonald\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Cheeseburger, the beefier McDouble and the cheesier Double Cheeseburger now all fall within 50-cents of one another.\n[3] At first glance, the double cheeseburger looks a lot like the McDouble, but it is not exactly the same thing. The main difference that you will notice is the amount of cheese that is on this sandwich. There are two slices of cheese on the double cheeseburger instead of just the one slice of cheese that comes on the McDouble. Even though it comes with two slices of cheese, it still has the onions, pickles, ketchup and mustard that come on the other burgers.\n[4] But I did it for you. With McDonald's recent release of the McDouble, they now have three basic, sub-$2 cheeseburgers: the cheeseburger, McDouble (two patties with one slice of cheese), and double cheeseburger (two patties with two slices of cheese).\n[5] Although we previously reported that the McDouble would be on the Dollar Menu, in Manhattan the cheeseburger appears on the Dollar Menu while the McDouble is $1.39 and the double cheeseburger is $1.49.\n[6] The Double Cheesburger is now $1.19 instead of a buck. Seriously, $.19/slice of cheese and a removal from the Dollar Menu. Do I order the Double Cheeseburger at its new full price or do I stick to the Dollar Menu and go with the McDouble. Of course, I go with the McDouble. One piece of McCheese might be better than two pieces of McCheese. I guess McDonalds thinks people like me who bought the Double Cheeseburger for a buck will pony up and pay the extra pennies. Sooner or later they will be charging for extra napkins and ketchup.\n[7] The Double Cheeseburger is priced at $1.49 and my Triple Cheeseburger was priced at $2.19. I just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand the point of paying 70-cents for an extra burger patty when you can just get two McDoubles for $2.00. Obviously the value of the Triple Cheeseburger makes no sense when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re comparing menu items.\n[8] The McDouble is listed as a slice of American cheese between two 100% beef patties, topped with pickles, onions, ketchup and mustard. mcdonalds.com. The Double Cheeseburger is listed as two slices of golden American cheese with two 100% all beef patties, pickles, onions, ketchup and mustard.\n[9] So whenever the McDouble hit the Dollar Menu and the Double Cheeseburger was thrown into the \u00e2\u0080\u009cBurgers\u00e2\u0080\u009d section at $1.19 or even higher ($1.29 in most places now), the average consumer scratched their head, winced their eyes, and fell over in a wrath of confusion and bewilderment.\n[10] The difference is that the Mighty Kid's Meal provides more food than what is typically found in a Happy Meal, providing a McDouble (a cheeseburger consisting of two patties and one slice of cheese) instead of a cheeseburger or a hamburger, and more Chicken McNuggets (6 versus 4), plus a larger drink (16oz vs 12oz).\n[11] There are many items that can be purchased at McDonald's for just $1, really, just check their dollar menu ! Here's a tip that not everyone knows... a McDouble from the McDonalds Dollar menu is the same thing as a Double Cheeseburger-well, minus one piece of cheese (and a lot of cents).\n[12] A double cheesburger has 2 slices of cheese with 2 meat patties. A mcdouble on the other hand only had 1 slice of cheese, but still 2 pieces of meat. I say had because mcdoubles arent sold in Australia (maybe a few stores but not a regular menu item) anymore. Other countries might be different but that's the difference in Australia.\n[13] There are 440 calories in a 1 cheeseburger serving of McDonald's Double Cheeseburger.

It's not nearly a value as the McDouble as it carries a price tag of $1.99.\n[16] Below are the nutrition facts and Weight Watchers points for a Bacon McDouble from McDonald's.

It manifest during infancy and early childhood, with the average age of diagnosis being three years old.\n[2] Spastic cerebral palsy is the most common type of the disorder. People have stiff muscles and awkward movements. Forms of spastic cerebral palsy include: 1 Spastic hemiplegia/hemiparesis typically affects the arm and hand on one side of the body, but it can also include the leg.ixed types of cerebral palsy refer to symptoms that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t correspond to any single type of CP but are a mix of types. For example, a child with mixed CP may have some muscles that are too tight and others that are too relaxed, creating a mix of stiffness and floppiness.\n[3] Spastic cerebral palsy is the most common type of cerebral palsy. The muscles of people with spastic cerebral palsy feel stiff and their movements may look stiff and jerky. Spasticity is a form of hypertonia, or increased muscle tone. This results in stiff muscles which can make movement difficult or even impossible.\n[4] Cerebral palsy information. Cerebral palsy is a condition resulting from damage to the areas of the brain that control movement. It is not a disease. People with cerebral palsy (CP) can have a range of chronic movement and posture disorders. Once the disorder appears, usually in the first few years of life, it doesn't worsen. Cerebral palsy can range from mild to severe and is purely a physical impairment.\n[5] Quadriplegia and Cerebral Palsy. Quadriplegia is a form of cerebral palsy that is characterized by the lack of the ability to move or feel both arms, both legs, and other parts of the body affected.Quadriplegia in cerebral palsy is caused by an injury to the spinal cord, which sends messages to body parts important for movement and sensation.Spastic quadriplegia is the most severe from of cerebral palsy in which all four limbs and the trunk are affected.Children with spastic quadriplegia usually have several compounded disabilities including mental retardation, problems with muscles that control the mouth and tongue, and difficulty in speaking.uadriplegia in cerebral palsy is caused by an injury to the spinal cord, which sends messages to body parts important for movement and sensation.

Cerebral palsy is a group of disorders usually characterized by some impairment in motor function, whether it is a slight limp, or an inability to walk. Cerebral palsy is a type of movement disorder that is non-progressive, meaning that the symptoms do not get worse over time.\n[9] A form of cerebral palsy, called spastic cerebral palsy, is caused when the brain damage occurs in the outer layer of the brain, the cerebral cortex.Spastic cerebral palsy is the most common form of cerebral palsy, affecting 70 to 80 percent of patients.pastic diplegia cerebral palsy tends to affect the legs of a patient more than the arms. Spastic diplegia cerebral palsy patients have more extensive involvement of the lower extremity than the upper extremity. This allows most people with spastic diplegia cerebral palsy to eventually walk.\n[10] Damage to any of these parts of the brain may cause cerebral palsy. 1 Spastic \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Spastic cerebral palsy is caused by damage to the motor cortex. 2 This causes exaggerated, jerky movements.3 Athetoid/dyskinetic \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Athetoid CP is caused by damage to the cerebellum and/or the basal ganglia.amage to different parts of the brain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s motor control centers causes different types of cerebral palsy.

Hypertonic CP is derived from hypertonia, meaning heightened muscle tension, rigidity, and stiffness. Causes of Hypertonic Cerebral Palsy. As with most other types of CP, hypertonic CP is most often caused by brain damage before, during, or shortly after birth.\n[19] This is the least common type of cerebral palsy with approximately 5% of overall cases. It would probably be fair to suggest that people suffering from ataxic cerebral palsy have less obvious symptoms than the other two. Symptoms include difficulty with balance, spatial awareness and have shaky and unsteady movement.\n[20] Cerebral Palsy is considered a neurological disorder caused by a non-progressive brain injury or malformation that occurs while the child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brain is under development. Cerebral Palsy primarily affects body movement and muscle coordination. Though Cerebral Palsy can be defined, having Cerebral Palsy does not define the person that has the condition.

Typically diagnosed between the ages of 9 months and 3 years old, cerebral palsy is an irreversible neurological disorder that causes significant musculoskeletal impairments, along with difficulty thinking, speaking and coordinating movement.\n[2] What Causes Cerebral Palsy? Cerebral palsy is caused by traumatic injury to a developing brain, including the parts of the brain responsible for motor control, coordination and balance. Damage to different parts of the brain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s motor control centers causes different types of cerebral palsy.\n[3] Ataxic Cerebral Palsy Explained. Like all other types of cerebral palsy, ataxic CP is a developmental disorder that affects motor function.Ataxic cerebral palsy is characterized by problems with balance and coordination. These issues are caused by damage to the developing brain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s motor control centers.\n[4] In cases of No CP, signs of impairment similar to cerebral palsy are diagnosed, but the cause is classified by the type of injury that caused the brain damage \u00e2\u0080\u0093 traumatic brain injury, shaken baby, or bacterial meningitis, for example.lthough familial cerebral palsy only accounts for approximately 1.6% of all cerebral palsy cases, a parent who has a child diagnosed with cerebral palsy has an increased risk of having a second child develop the condition. In these cases, molecular tests can identify the susceptible gene.\n[5] Orthopedic Surgery for Cerebral Palsy. Guide. Orthopedic surgery is used to treat tight muscles and spasticity related to cerebral palsy. An incision is made in the skin over the affected muscle. Parts of the muscle are then cut to release the tightness.hy It Is Done. The type of orthopedic surgery done to treat problems from cerebral palsy depends on which muscle groups are affected. Some basic goals are to loosen the: 1 Muscles that make the hips turn toward the body (partial release of the hip adductor muscles).\n[6] Cerebral palsy is caused by traumatic injury to a developing brain, including the parts of the brain responsible for motor control, coordination and balance. Damage to different parts of the brain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s motor control centers causes different types of cerebral palsy.The level of disability depends on the severity and timing of the brain injury. 1 About 70 percent of cerebral palsy cases are caused by prenatal injuries. 2 About 20 percent are caused by injuries during birth.amage to different parts of the brain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s motor control centers causes different types of cerebral palsy. The level of disability depends on the severity and timing of the brain injury. 1 About 70 percent of cerebral palsy cases are caused by prenatal injuries. 2 About 20 percent are caused by injuries during birth.\n[7] Types of Cerebral Palsy. Cerebral palsy can be described by the way it affects people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s movement, the part of the body affected and by how severe the affects are. Quadriplegia (a form of bilateral cerebral palsy) Both arms and legs are affected. The muscles of the trunk, face and mouth are often also affected.\n[8] Cerebral Palsy. Cerebral Palsy is a non-progressive neuromuscular disorder that disrupts a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to move, sit, stand, walk, talk and use their hands.The severity of the movement disorder and the type of movement difficulties can vary greatly.erebral Palsy. Cerebral Palsy is a non-progressive neuromuscular disorder that disrupts a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to move, sit, stand, walk, talk and use their hands.\n[9] Children with cerebral palsy often have a disability that renders them unable to communicate. To complicate issues more, if the child has a severe form of cerebral palsy, he or she may not be able to write, type, point, or sign.erebral palsy affects muscle tone, gross and fine motor functions, balance, coordination, and posture. These conditions are mainly orthopedic in nature and are considered primary conditions of cerebral palsy.\n[10] Cerebral palsy is classified into different types to help describe how each condition affects the individual. Each type of cerebral palsy is classified based on two factors: the type and location of movement issues.For example, spasticity (type) in the legs (location) is known as spastic diplegia. The type of movement issues seen in a person with CP depends how their brain injury causes problems with muscle tone.ach type of cerebral palsy is classified based on two factors: the type and location of movement issues.

Hypertonic CP is derived from hypertonia, meaning heightened muscle tension, rigidity, and stiffness. Causes of Hypertonic Cerebral Palsy. As with most other types of CP, hypertonic CP is most often caused by brain damage before, during, or shortly after birth.\n[12] Dyskinetic Athetoid Cerebral Palsy. Dyskinetic Cerebral Palsy, also known as athetoid cerebral palsy or ADCP, is a form of cerebral palsy marked by involuntary movement. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not as common as spastic cerebral palsy but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not as rare as ataxic cerebral palsy. Dyskinetic/Athetoid cerebral palsy is caused by damage to the brain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basal ganglia. The basal ganglia is responsible for submitting messages to the body to help coordinate and control movements. When it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s damaged, voluntary movements are compromised, resulting in spasticity and other abnormal movements.\n[13] Spastic cerebral palsy is the most common type of cerebral palsy. The muscles of people with spastic cerebral palsy feel stiff and their movements may look stiff and jerky. Spasticity is a form of hypertonia, or increased muscle tone. This results in stiff muscles which can make movement difficult or even impossible.\n[14] Spastic cerebral palsy is the most common type of the disorder. People have stiff muscles and awkward movements. Forms of spastic cerebral palsy include: 1 Spastic hemiplegia/hemiparesis typically affects the arm and hand on one side of the body, but it can also include the leg.ixed types of cerebral palsy refer to symptoms that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t correspond to any single type of CP but are a mix of types. For example, a child with mixed CP may have some muscles that are too tight and others that are too relaxed, creating a mix of stiffness and floppiness.\n[15] A form of cerebral palsy, called spastic cerebral palsy, is caused when the brain damage occurs in the outer layer of the brain, the cerebral cortex.Spastic cerebral palsy is the most common form of cerebral palsy, affecting 70 to 80 percent of patients.pastic diplegia cerebral palsy tends to affect the legs of a patient more than the arms. Spastic diplegia cerebral palsy patients have more extensive involvement of the lower extremity than the upper extremity. This allows most people with spastic diplegia cerebral palsy to eventually walk.\n[16] Spastic Diplegia Cerebral Palsy. Diplegic cerebral palsy, also known as spastic diplegia, is one of nine different types of cerebral palsy. The most common problem with the disorder in muscle stiffness. It manifest during infancy and early childhood, with the average age of diagnosis being three years old.\n[17] Quadriplegia and Cerebral Palsy. Quadriplegia is a form of cerebral palsy that is characterized by the lack of the ability to move or feel both arms, both legs, and other parts of the body affected.Quadriplegia in cerebral palsy is caused by an injury to the spinal cord, which sends messages to body parts important for movement and sensation.Spastic quadriplegia is the most severe from of cerebral palsy in which all four limbs and the trunk are affected.Children with spastic quadriplegia usually have several compounded disabilities including mental retardation, problems with muscles that control the mouth and tongue, and difficulty in speaking.uadriplegia in cerebral palsy is caused by an injury to the spinal cord, which sends messages to body parts important for movement and sensation.

Seizures are common in spastic quadriplegia, and spastic quadriplegia is the form of cerebral palsy most likely to affect intelligence. Many people with spastic quadriplegia have moderate to severe mental retardation.\n[3] Cerebral palsy types. Cerebral palsy is a word that we often hear but many fail to understand. People think cerebral palsy or CP as it is often called is a mental disorder or a birth injury and it is understandable why they think that way. Perhaps we should look at the name for clues. cerebral which means \u00e2\u0080\u0098of the brain\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and palsy which means \u00e2\u0080\u0098paralysis'. Cerebral palsy is a condition brought about following an injury to the brain and that covers the time a baby is in the womb as a neonate, during birth and the following two years, although experts cannot agree exactly how long this period extends.\n[4] There are four different types of cerebral palsy. Spastic cerebral palsy is the most common form, affecting approximately 70 percent of all individuals with cerebral palsy. Spasticity can be either a mild or severe impairment of motor functions.\n[5] Cerebral palsy is caused by traumatic injury to a developing brain, including the parts of the brain responsible for motor control, coordination and balance.

Perhaps we should look at the name for clues. cerebral which means \u00e2\u0080\u0098of the brain\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and palsy which means \u00e2\u0080\u0098paralysis'. Cerebral palsy is a condition brought about following an injury to the brain and that covers the time a baby is in the womb as a neonate, during birth and the following two years, although experts cannot agree exactly how long this period extends.\n[20] Overview. Cerebral palsy is a disorder of muscle movement and coordination. It is caused by an injury to a child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brain that occurs before birth or during infancy. It affects the part of the brain that controls body movement.ther Types of Cerebral Palsy. Symptoms of other types of cerebral palsy may also include floppy muscle tone and lack of muscle coordination. Tremors or an unsteady gait are also common.\nSearch Query: types of dysarthria from cerebral palsy.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Therefore, all files in the RSA folder are automatically encrypted with a random, symmetric key called the user's master key. The user's master key is generated by the RC4 algorithm in the Base or Enhanced CSP.\n[2] Some HSM systems are also hardware cryptographic accelerators. They usually cannot beat the performance of hardware-only solutions for symmetric key operations. However, with performance ranges from 1 to 7,000 1024-bit RSA signs per second, HSMs can provide significant CPU offload for asymmetric key operations.ypical HSM devices can perform about 50 to 1,000 1024-bit RSA operations/second. Some performance at longer key sizes is becoming increasingly important. To address this issue, some HSMs now support elliptic curve cryptography. Specialized HSM devices can reach numbers as high as +7,000 operations per second.\n[3] Generate new key pair(s). Click this button if you want to generate a new key to use in the certificate. When you generate a key pair, you must specify the modulus to determine the size of the key. This new key appears in the RSA Keys window when the wizard is completed.\n[4] AES, DES and Blowfish use symmetric key algorithms. Each system uses a key which is shared among the sender and the recipient. This key has the ability to encrypt and decrypt the data. With asymmetric encryption such as Diffie-Hellman and RSA, a pair of keys is created and assigned: a private key and a public key.\n[5] The following command will create an SSH key, using RSA encryption, with a comment of \u00e2\u0080\u009ckey-name\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and save it in the .ssh directory of our home directory, with the private key file key-name, and public key file key-name.pub.

Great question. Not all key pairs are created equal. They the keys used for a self signed certificate (https) are not the same key-pair used for SSH. Different keys, different rules about what needs to be in place before they are created.\n[10] To make such collision finding infeasible, you have to use a message authentication code (MAC). Asymmetric case. If you are using PKCS#1 v1.5 padding for your RSA encryption, the most significant octet after the RSA private key operation has to be 0x02, which it will be with a probability of approximately one in 256.\n[11] 3. Generate the RSA Keys. The switch or router should have RSA keys that it will use during the SSH process. So, generate these using crypto command as shown below. Also, if you are running on an older Cisco IOS image, it is highly recommended that you upgrade to latest Cisco IOS.. From the switch, if you do \u00e2\u0080\u0098sh ip ssh\u00e2\u0080\u0099, it will confirm that the SSH is enabled on this cisco device. After the above configurations, login from a remote machine to verify that you can ssh to this cisco switch. In this example, 192.168.101.2 is the management ip-address of the switch.\n[12] To create an asymmetric key and save it in a key container. Create a new instance of a CspParameters class and pass the name that you want to call the key container to the CspParameters.KeyContainerName field.f you need to store a private key, you should use a key container.

It works as follows: take two large primes, p and q, and find their product n = pq ; n is called the modulus.\n[11] RSA: read the definition of RSA and 8,000+ other financial and investing terms in the NASDAQ.com Financial Glossary. Hot Topics: ETFs | Smart Portfolio | Currencies | Online Broker Center\n[12] Unlike their corresponding public keys, private keys must be protected. Therefore, all files in the RSA folder are automatically encrypted with a random, symmetric key called the user's master key. The user's master key is generated by the RC4 algorithm in the Base or Enhanced CSP.\n[13] AES, DES and Blowfish use symmetric key algorithms. Each system uses a key which is shared among the sender and the recipient. This key has the ability to encrypt and decrypt the data. With asymmetric encryption such as Diffie-Hellman and RSA, a pair of keys is created and assigned: a private key and a public key.\n[14] To make such collision finding infeasible, you have to use a message authentication code (MAC). Asymmetric case. If you are using PKCS#1 v1.5 padding for your RSA encryption, the most significant octet after the RSA private key operation has to be 0x02, which it will be with a probability of approximately one in 256.\n[15] In order to assign one or more assemblies a strong name, you must first create the 1,024-bit public and private key pair. This randomly creates a pair of 1,024-bit cryptographic keys. You can use these keys for encryption and decryption by using the RSA public/private key algorithm.\n[16] Some HSM systems are also hardware cryptographic accelerators. They usually cannot beat the performance of hardware-only solutions for symmetric key operations. However, with performance ranges from 1 to 7,000 1024-bit RSA signs per second, HSMs can provide significant CPU offload for asymmetric key operations.ypical HSM devices can perform about 50 to 1,000 1024-bit RSA operations/second. Some performance at longer key sizes is becoming increasingly important. To address this issue, some HSMs now support elliptic curve cryptography. Specialized HSM devices can reach numbers as high as +7,000 operations per second.\n[17] Commerce Server 2002. In Commerce Server 2002, asymmetric encryption is done using the RSA public-key key exchange algorithm. The key length is 512 bits, and the Cryptographic Service Provider (CSP) used is Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider.\n[18] The legacy key files also have the .key extension, but CNG key files do not have the .key extension. CNG fully supports Unicode key container names; CNG uses a hash of the Unicode container name, whereas CryptoAPI uses a hash of the ANSI container name. CNG is more flexible with regard to RSA key pairs.\n[19] To create an asymmetric key and save it in a key container. Create a new instance of a CspParameters class and pass the name that you want to call the key container to the CspParameters.KeyContainerName field.f you need to store a private key, you should use a key container. For more information on key containers, see Understanding Machine-Level and User-Level RSA Key Containers.\n[20] The following command will create an SSH key, using RSA encryption, with a comment of \u00e2\u0080\u009ckey-name\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and save it in the .ssh directory of our home directory, with the private key file key-name, and public key file key-name.pub. Now that we have the SSH key pair, we can import to EC2.\nSearch Query: rsa definition key.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Among its products include the RSA BSAFE cryptography libraries and the SecurID authentication token.\n[2] An integer a divides a an integer b if there is an integer n with the property that b = na. You are right, the RSA signature size is dependent on the key size, the RSA signature size is equal to the length of the modulus in bytes. This means that for a n bit key, the resulting signature will be exactly n bits long.\n[3] RSA Data Security Digital Signature Process. In the RSA digital signature process, the private key is used to encrypt only the message digest. The encrypted message digest becomes the digital signature and is attached to the original data.

RSA SecurID software tokens integrate with more than 400 applications and devices. Integrations are available free of charge and are jointly tested by RSA and partners.\n[6] Configuring SSH and HTTPS requires the use of a general use RSA public/private keys. In order to generate this you must first set a domain name for the device by using the ip domain-name NAME.TLD command in global configuration. Once set you then generate the general-use keys by executing the command crypto key generate rsa general-keys modulus {360-4096} whereas 2048 is the most common. Once general use keys have been generated the Cisco IOS device will automatically enable SSH however you must manually disable TELNET on the VTY lines.\n[7] RSA scrambles data based on the product of two prime numbers, each of which is 100 digits long.

Open SSL is much more secure than WEP, it uses 1024 bit encryption. WEP is mostly for wireless routers, simple and implements a lessor version of the Open SSL and Open SSH keys, which are usually RSA and DSA. I don't recall any definition of Open System that had anything to do with security or encryption. A look up of the definition of the acronyms might help.\n[10] RSA Signing is Not RSA Decryption.

RSA is a public-key cryptosystem for both encryption and authentication; it was invented in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman [RSA78]. It works as follows: take two large primes, p and q, and find their product n = pq ; n is called the modulus.\n[17] RSA scrambles data based on the product of two prime numbers, each of which is 100 digits long. RSA is known as a public key encryption system, meaning that many people can use it to encode information, but only the person who holds the key (or knows the value of the two prime numbers) can decode it again.\n[18] RSA involves a public key and a private key. The public key can be known by everyone and is used for encrypting messages. Messages encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted in a reasonable amount of time using the private key.\n[19] RSA involves a public key and a private key. The public key can be known by everyone and is used for encrypting messages.

This algorithm is the first of its kind that can be used for public key encryption as well as digital signatures.The RSA Algorithm is extremely secure due to long keys and up-to-date implementations. It is widely used in e-commerce protocols.rivate Key is used to decrypt the messages that are encrypted using the public key. The message or the data is encrypted using the public key. Encryption involves converting the message into a coded format.

In a multivariate analysis, the risk of barotrauma was increased in mechanically ventilated patients who had asthma, chronic interstitial lung disease, or ARDS and in those who developed ARDS during mechanical ventilation.\n[10] Mechanical ventilation, in the healthcare setting or home, helps patients breathe by assisting the inhalation of oxygen into the lungs and the exhalation of carbon dioxide. Depending on the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s condition, mechanical ventilation can help support or completely control breathing.\n[11] The primary hypothesis of this study is that early use of caffeine in mechanically ventilated preterm infants will reduce the time to first elective extubation and secondarily, that this will reduce the total duration of mechanical ventilation and oxygen supplementation, and reduce the incidence and severity of BPD.\n[12] This form of mechanical ventilation includes pressure control ventilation (PCV), pressure support ventilation (PSV), and several noninvasive modalities applied via a tight-fitting face mask. In all of these modalities, the ventilator delivers a set inspiratory pressure.\n[13] Mechanical ventilation systems circulate fresh air using ducts and fans, rather than relying on airflow through small holes or cracks in a home\u00e2\u0080\u0099s walls, roof, or windows. Homeowners can breathe easier knowing their home has good ventilation. Improved Comfort. Mechanical ventilation systems allow a constant flow of outside air into the home and can also provide filtration, dehumidification, and conditioning of the incoming outside air.\n[14] Plateau pressure. Plateau pressure (PPLAT) is the pressure applied to small airways and alveoli during positive-pressure mechanical ventilation. It is measured during an inspiratory pause on the mechanical ventilator. Morgan, Edward G., Maged Mikhail and Michael Murry.\n[15] This article reviews assisted ventilation of the newborn, highlighting the concepts of pulmonary mechanics, gas exchange, respiration control, and lung injury that can be used to enhance conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) so as to improve survival and reduce adverse effects.\n[16] 2.

Development of a subatmospheric pressure around the thorax and abdomen results in air being drawn into the lungs through the mouth and nose.\n[20] Mechanical ventilation is the use of a mechanical device (machine) to inflate and deflate the lungs. Mechanical ventilation provides the force needed to deliver air to the lungs in a patient whose own ventilatory abilities are diminished or lost. Breathing requires the movement of air into and out of the lungs. This is normally accomplished by the diaphragm and chest muscles.

A tracheostomy might afford the patient a better pattern of breathing and hence a better possibility of surviving ARDS.\n[3] pressure trigger a trigger for initiating assisted ventilation, consisting of a mechanism for measuring pressure and starting assisted ventilation when pressure reaches a given level. time trigger a trigger for initiating assisted ventilation, consisting of a mechanism that measures frequency of respirations and starts assisted ventilation when the respiratory frequency is at a given point.\n[4] Glossopharyngeal breathing as positive pressure ventilation. Glossopharyngeal breathing is a form of positive pressure ventilation produced by the patient's voluntary muscles where boluses of air are forced into the lungs. Paralyzed patients dependent on a mechanical ventilator may be able to use GPB continuously, other than during sleep, to substitute the mechanical ventilation.\n[5] Introduction In patients assisted by mechanical ventilation, the Work Of Breathing (WOB) is shared between the patient and the ventilator. During weaning from mechanical ventilation, the WOB performed by the patient must be adequate and efficient to sustain spontaneous ventilation after extubation. The monitoring of WOB during weaning might allow a better management of the weaning process.\n[6] Mechanical ventilation is more controllable than natural ventilation. In Mechanical Ventilation blowers, fans, filters, and ducts are used for transporting and removing air from a space. There are two types of fans used for the transmission of air.\n[7] Mechanical Ventilation Breathe Easy with Fresh Air in the Home Without mechanical ventilation to provide fresh air, moisture, odors, and other pollutants can build up inside a home.

Mechanical ventilation provides the force needed to deliver air to the lungs in a patient whose own ventilatory abilities are diminished or lost. Breathing requires the movement of air into and out of the lungs. This is normally accomplished by the diaphragm and chest muscles. A variety of medical conditions can impair the ability of these muscles to accomplish this task, including: muscular dystrophies.\n[19] Mechanical ventilation, in the healthcare setting or home, helps patients breathe by assisting the inhalation of oxygen into the lungs and the exhalation of carbon dioxide. Depending on the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s condition, mechanical ventilation can help support or completely control breathing.\n[20] Mechanical ventilation can decrease the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work of breathing by unloading respiratory muscles in a synchronous manner.

One of the strongest is Soft Shadows.. A romantic plea for love and understanding, it ends with a three-part harmony wail that is awesome in its execution, and drives home the point that the Monotones could execute exceedingly well on slow as well as fast songs.\n[14] To show that it does indeed have a limit, we'll prove that it is monotonic decreasing and bounded below. Since the terms of the sequence are positive, the sequence is clearly bounded below by 0. To show monotonicity: an+1- an= \u00e2\u0088\u009a(2an- 1) - \u00e2\u0088\u009a(2an-1- 1) and if we now use the fact that \u00e2\u0088\u009ax - \u00e2\u0088\u009ay = (x - y)/(\u00e2\u0088\u009ax + \u00e2\u0088\u009ay)\n[15] The so-called new tango or alternative music promoted by them often lack an opposite theme. (See The Signature of Tango.) It is either too soft, without a clear rhythm, or too monotonous, lacking of rhythmic diversity. In contrast, classic tango is created in line with the characteristics of the dance. Unlike mush soft-music or monotonous march, classic tango not only has a recognizable rhythm, but also is rich in syncopation, and so is very danceable.\n[16] It doesn't mean anything in particular in reference to java. A class invariant is simply a property that holds for all instances of a class, always, no matter what other code does. For example, X has the class invariant that there is a y property and it is never null and it has a value of type Y. fails to maintain two important invariants. 1 That count never returns a negative value because of possible underflow. 2 That calls to count are strictly monotonically increasing.\n[17] Pitch describes the degree of highness or lowness of a vocal tone. For example, when a person is excited or nervous their pitch may become higher. If a person is trying to control emotion or expressing something serious or confidential they might use a low pitched voice. Practise using a range of notes in your voice so that your voice is flexible and expressive. A voice that is all on one note is in monotone and unless this is a character decision, it can be very boring to listen to.\n[18] rpa benefits rpa benefits Our main objetive is to provide RPA benefits to society offering the possibility of improving the current competitiveness in most sectors of the economy.

The AD650 V/F/V (voltage-to-frequency or frequency-to-voltage converter) provides a combination of high frequency operation and low nonlinearity previously unavailable in monolithic form. The inherent monotonicity of the V/F transfer function makes the AD650 useful as a high-resolution analog-to-digital converter.\n[8] Analogy also spices up the sentence preventing it from getting monotonous.

Hence, zero is its global minimum. The only cases where the square x2 of a number is less than x occur when, that is, when x belongs to an open interval (0,1) .\n[10] page 1 of 3. First, let's establish some definitions: f is said to be increasing on an interval I if for all x in I, whenever. f is said to be decreasing on an interval I if for all x in I, whenever. A function is monotonic on an interval I if it is only increasing or only decreasing on I. The derivative can help us determine whether a function is increasing or decreasing on an interval. This knowledge will later allow us to sketch rough graphs of functions. Let f be continuous on [a, b] and differentiable on (a, b) . If for all x on (a, b) , then f is increasing on [a, b] . If for all x on (a, b) , then f is decreasing on [a, b] . This should make intuitive sense. In the graph below, wherever the slope of the tangent is positive, the function seems to be increasing.\n[11] Expansion joint in a road bridge used to avoid damage from thermal expansion.

Any affine function is both (non-strictly) concave and convex. 2 The sine function is concave on the interval. 3 The function, where is the determinant of a nonnegative-definite matrix B, is concave. 4 Practical example: rays bending in computation of radiowave attenuation in the atmosphere.\n[11] For example, Rudin, in his Principles of Mathematical Analysis (Definition 3.13), defines a sequence $\\{s_n\\}$ of real numbers to be: (a) monotonically increasing if $s_n \\leq s_{n+1}, (n = 1, 2, 3, \\cdots)$ [i.e., non-decreasing].o. $x(0)=0, x(1)=0, x(2)=1$ is non-decreasing, but not monotonically increasing. It is monotonically increasing if $x(1)=0.5$ instead, for example.\n[12] The real absolute value function is continuous everywhere. It is differentiable everywhere except for x = 0. It is monotonically decreasing on the interval (\u00e2\u0088\u0092\u00e2\u0088\u009e,0] and monotonically increasing on the interval [0,+\u00e2\u0088\u009e).\n[13] Likewise, a function is called monotonically decreasing (also decreasing or nonincreasing) if, whenever, then, so it reverses the order (see Figure 2). If the order in the definition of monotonicity is replaced by the strict order, then one obtains a stronger requirement.\n[14] In calculus, a function defined on a subset of the real numbers with real values is called monotonic if and only if it is either entirely increasing or decreasing. It is called monotonically increasing (also increasing or nondecreasing), if for all and such that one has, so preserves the order (see Figure 1).\n[15] Likewise, a function is called monotonically decreasing (also decreasing or non-increasing) if, whenever x \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 y, then f (x) \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 f (y), so it reverses the order (see Figure 2). If the order \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 in the definition of Monotonicity is replaced by the strict order strictly increasing.\n[16] Quite similarly, a function is termed as monotonically decreasing or a decreasing function if Y axis values do decrease as the X axis values are decreasing. The nature of increasing or decreasing function is to either increase or decrease throughout the function.\n[17] The first derivative test examines a function's monotonic properties (where the function is increasing or decreasing) focusing on a particular point in its domain. If the function switches from increasing to decreasing at the point, then the function will achieve a highest value at that point.\n[18] 5 Responses to 'Things SQL needs: sargability of monotonic functions'. 1 First, this was an excellent article.

Monotonic functions are the functions which maintained the order of functions value. As we all know that the variation in independent value also make the variation in functions value. A suitable example for this is monotonic functions or linear polynomials. The monotonic functions maintains the straight line in linear programming graph. This is also called the monotonic nature over the domain and real numbers. A monotonic function increases and decreases over the interval.\n[2] To solidify our understanding of what a monotonic function is, let's consider what a non-monotonic function is. A non-monotonic function is a function that is increasing and decreasing on different intervals of its domain. For example, consider our initial example f(x) equals x 2.\n[3] Montonic Function. When a function is increasing on its entire domain or decreasing on its entire domain, we say that the function is strictly monotonic, and we call it a monotonic function. For example, consider the function g(x) equals x 3: Notice the graph of g is increasing everywhere. Therefore, this is a monotonic function.\n[4] An important application of monotonic functions is in probability theory. If is a random variable, its cumulative distribution function is a monotonically increasing function. A function is unimodal if it is monotonically increasing up to some point (the mode) and then monotonically decreasing. When is a strictly monotonic function, then is injective on its domain, and if is the range of, then there is an inverse function on for.\n[5] Note that just monotonic transformation of a concave function isnot necessarily concave: consider, for example f (x) = x and g (z) = z 3 .Thus the concavity of a function is not ordinal, it is cardinal property.Economic ExampleSuppose production function f (x) is concave and the cost function c (x) is convex.ote that just monotonic transformation of a concave function isnot necessarily concave: consider, for example f (x) = x and g (z) = z 3 .Thus the concavity of a function is not ordinal, it is cardinal property.Economic ExampleSuppose production function f (x) is concave and the cost function c (x) is convex.\n[6] monotonic function. Monotonic Function. (or monotone function), a function whose increments \u00ce\u0094f(x) = f(x\u00e2\u0080\u00b2) \u00e2\u0088\u0092 f(x) do not change sign when \u00ce\u0094x = x\u00e2\u0080\u00b2 \u00e2\u0088\u0092 x > 0; that is, the increments are either always nonnegative or always nonpositive. Somewhat inaccurately, a monotonic function can be defined as a function that always varies in the same direction.\n[7] Monotonic Function. A monotonic function is a function which is either entirely nonincreasing or nondecreasing. A function is monotonic if its first derivative (which need not be continuous) does not change sign.\n[8] I've never heard of monotonic being used for two (input) variables, but I suppose it would mean that, for each fixed value of y, u is a monotonic function of x, and for each fixed value of x, u is a monotonic function of y (and I expect they'd need to be either both monotonic increasing or both monotonic decreasing).\n[9] In mathematics, a monotonic function (or monotone function) is a function between ordered sets that preserves or reverses the given order. This concept first arose in calculus, and was later generalized to the more abstract setting of order theory. 1 Monotonicity in calculus and analysis.\n[10] In calculus, a function defined on a subset of the real numbers with real values is called monotonic if and only if it is either entirely increasing or decreasing. It is called monotonically increasing (also increasing or nondecreasing), if for all and such that one has, so preserves the order (see Figure 1).Likewise, a function is called monotonically decreasing (also decreasing or nonincreasing) if, whenever, then, so it reverses the order (see Figure 2).If the order in the definition of monotonicity is replaced by the strict order, then one obtains a stronger requirement.A function with this property is called strictly increasing. Again, by inverting the order symbol, one finds a corresponding concept called strictly decreasing.wo facts about these functions are: 1 if is a monotonic function defined on an interval, then is differentiable almost everywhere on, i.e. the set of numbers in such that is not differentiable in has Lebesgue measure zero.\n[11] Figure 1. A monotonically increasing function (it is strictly increasing on the left and right while just non-decreasing in the middle.). Figure 2. A monotonically decreasing function. In calculus, a function f defined on a subset of the real numbers with real values is called monotonic (also monotonically increasing, increasing or non-decreasing), if for all x and y such that x \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 y one has f (x) \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 f (y), so f preserves the order (see Figure 1).\n[12] Here's the definition of the monotonic function from Wikipedia: In calculus, a function f defined on a subset of the real numbers with real values is called monotonic (also monotonically increasing, increasing or non-decreasing), if for all x and y such that x \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 y one has f(x) \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 f(y), so f preserves the order.\n[13] In calculus, a function defined on a subset of the real numbers with real values is called monotonic if and only if it is either entirely increasing or decreasing.

Suicide rate among recent veterans 50% higher than non-military civilians. Recent veterans have committed suicide at a much higher rate than people who never served in the military, according to a new analysis that provides the most thorough accounting so far of the problem.\n[16] The findings are the latest in a series of studies prompted by a military suicide rate that has nearly doubled since 2005. The study\u00e2\u0080\u0099s authors and others cautioned, however, that the findings do not rule out combat exposure as a reason for the increase in suicides, adding that more information was needed.he study found that the suicide rate for troops who left the military before completing a four-year enlistment was nearly twice that of troops who stayed. The rate for troops who were involuntarily discharged under less-than-honorable conditions for disciplinary infractions was nearly three times higher.\n[17] The largest study to date of a rising suicide rate among military personnel, published Wednesday in JAMA Psychiatry, found no connection between suicide and deployment overseas in support of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.he study found that the suicide rate for troops who left the military before completing a four-year enlistment was nearly twice that of troops who stayed. The rate for troops who were involuntarily discharged under less-than-honorable conditions for disciplinary infractions was nearly three times higher.\n[18] Suicide rates in the military were traditionally lower than among civilians in the same age range, but in 2004 the suicide rate in the U.S. Army began to climb, surpassing the civilian rate in 2008. Substance use is involved in many of these suicides. The 2010 report of the Army Suicide Prevention Task Force found that 29 percent of active duty Army suicides from fiscal year (FY) 2005 to FY 2009 involved alcohol or drug use; and in 2009, prescription drugs were involved in almost one third of them.\n[19] War was the leading cause of death in the military nearly every year between 2004 and 2011 until suicides became the top means of dying for troops in 2012 and 2013, according to a bar chart published this week in a monthly Pentagon medical statistical analysis journal.\n[20] The data was then compared with a previous investigation \u00e2\u0080\u0093 primarily an estimation \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that had been conducted over the same time period, and had found a suicide rate of 18 per day. Many of these suicides involve older veterans; 69 percent of the suicides recorded were by veterans age 50 and older. But another way to look at this is that 31 percent of these suicides were by veterans 49 and younger. In other words,by men in the prime of life. And then there are the shockingly common active duty suicides. Just two weeks ago, the military released data showing that suicides among those on active duty hit a record high in 2012. There were 349 suicides among active duty personnel \u00e2\u0080\u0093 almost one a day. That means there are now more suicides among active duty soldiers than there are combat deaths.\nSearch Query: causes of military suicide.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

At the nerve terminal, neurotransmitters are present within 35\u00e2\u0080\u009350 nm membrane-encased vesicles called synaptic vesicles.\n[2] neurotransmitter. a substance (e.g., norepinephrine, acetylcholine, dopamine) that is released from the axon terminal of a presynaptic neuron on excitation, and that travels across the synaptic cleft to either excite or inhibit the target cell. substance (e.g. norepinephrine, acetylcholine, dopamine) that is released from the axon terminal of a presynaptic neuron on excitation, and which travels across the synaptic cleft to either excite or inhibit the target cell.\n[3] b) an axon and a dendrite of another neuron (axo-dendritic synapse), c) between the axon terminals (telodendria) of a neuron and the terminal regions of another neuron (axo-axonic synapses). Synapses are essential for homeostasis as they can either transmit or inhibit impulses.)

Axon terminals are that part of a nerve cell that make synaptic connections with another nerve cell or with an effector cell (e.g. muscle cell or gland cell).\n[6] Neurotransmitters are packaged into synaptic vesicles that cluster beneath the axon terminal membrane on the presynaptic side of a synapse. The axonal terminals are specialized to release the electrical impulse of the presynaptic cell.\n[7] The synapse is located at the end of each axonal end branch. Here the end branch forms a small button-like knob, referred to as the synaptic knob. This knob is adjacent to a tiny cleft or synapse. When a nerve impulse reaches this knob, a drug called a neurotransmitter is released from vesicles into the synapse. The neurotransmitter diffuses across the gap and binds to receptors on the membrane of the adjacent neuron or muscle cell.\n[8] a substance (e.g. norepinephrine, acetylcholine, dopamine) that is released from the axon terminal of a presynaptic neuron on excitation, and which travels across the synaptic cleft to either excite or inhibit the target cell. adrenergic neurotransmitter.see norepinephrine. substance (e.g. norepinephrine, acetylcholine, dopamine) that is released from the axon terminal of a presynaptic neuron on excitation, and which travels across the synaptic cleft to either excite or inhibit the target cell. adrenergic neurotransmitter.\n[9] Similar to neurotransmitter release at the presynaptic nerve terminal, ACh secretion along the axon could be elicited by the action potential or by hypertonic solutions. We found that the parameters of neurotransmitter secretion at the nerve terminal and at the middle axon were strikingly similar.he vesicles involved in neurotransmitter secretion along the axon appear to be surprisingly similar to the genuine synaptic vesicles at the nerve terminal. These results are consistent with a scenario in which the whole axon formed by a naive neuron can be considered as a giant precursor of the nerve terminal.\n[10] 1 Storage of the neurotransmitter in storage granules or vesicles in the axon terminal. 2 Calcium enters the axon terminal during an action potential, causing release of the neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft.\n[11] Axon terminals are that part of a nerve cell that make synaptic connections with another nerve cell or with an effector cell (e.g. muscle cell or gland cell).

Exons are parts of DNA that are converted into mature messenger RNA . The process by which DNA is used as a template to create mRNA is called transcription.\n[13] The prion is a product of a human gene, termed the PrP gene, found on chromosome 20. This gene contains two exons separated by a single intron. Exon I and Exon II are transcribed and the two RNAs ligated into a single mRNA.\n[14] The nucleic acid sequence in the DNA, or RNA transcript following genetic splicing. Supplement. Genes contain exons which are regions coding for proteins and which are interrupted by the unused sequences called introns. Exons have been found to include both sequences coding for amino acids and untranslated sequences. The introns are removed and the exons are joined together to form the final functional mRNA. Related forms: exonic (adjective). Compare: intron. See also: DNA, RNA, translation, mRNA, protein synthesis.\n[15] Introns. Introns are sequences of nucleotides present in the genes between exons. These nucleotide sequences do not code for proteins, and that means introns are not immediately important for the process of protein synthesis. Exons are found at the two ends of a gene while introns are always found inside the gene. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 When mutations take place, introns sometimes contribute nucleotides but usually not the other way around. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Both DNA and RNA contain introns and exons, but mature RNA only contain exons and not the introns.\n[16] An exon is any part of a gene that codes for a part of the final mature RNA product of that gene after introns have been removed by RNA splicing.The term exon refers to both the DNA sequence within a gene and to the corresponding sequence in RNA transcripts.In RNA splicing, introns are removed and exons are covalently joined to one another as part of generating the mature messenger RNA.he term exon refers to both the DNA sequence within a gene and to the corresponding sequence in RNA transcripts.\n[17] An exon is any part of a gene that codes for a part of the final mature RNA product of that gene after introns have been removed by RNA splicing.The term exon refers to both the DNA sequence within a gene and to the corresponding sequence in RNA transcripts.In RNA splicing, introns are removed and exons are covalently joined to one another as part of generating the mature messenger RNA.n exon is any part of a gene that codes for a part of the final mature RNA product of that gene after introns have been removed by RNA splicing.\n[18] Exon. any nucleotide sequence encoded by a gene that remains present within the final mature RNA product of that gene after introns have been removed by RNA splicing.

If the genomic DNA sequence of a gene is known, RT-PCR can be used to map the location of exons and introns in the gene. 2 The 5' end of a gene (corresponding to the transcription start site) is typically identified by RACE-PCR (Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends).\n[9] Such stretches of DNA, which get transcribed into RNA but not translated into protein, are called introns. Those stretches of DNA that do code for amino acids in the protein are called exons.

Introns, on the other hand, are termed as nucleotide sequences seen within the genes which are removed through RNA splicing for generating a mature RNA molecule.. Exons are coding areas whereas introns are non-coding areas. 2. An exon is termed as a nucleic acid sequence which is represented in the RNA molecule. Introns, on the other hand, are termed as nucleotide sequences seen within the genes which are removed through RNA splicing for generating a mature RNA molecule. 3.\n[20] For other uses, see Exon (disambiguation) . An exon is any part of a gene that codes for a part of the final mature RNA product of that gene after introns have been removed by RNA splicing. The term exon refers to both the DNA sequence within a gene and to the corresponding sequence in RNA transcripts. In RNA splicing, introns are removed and exons are covalently joined to one another as part of generating the mature messenger RNA.\nSearch Query: exons definition biology.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

In molecular biology and genetics, splicing is a modification of the nascent pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) transcript in which introns are removed and exons are joined. For nuclear-encoded genes, splicing takes place within the nucleus after or concurrently with transcription.\n[2] Exons, Introns, Codons, & their equivalents. Three common technical terms in molecular genetics, exon, intron, and codon, have specific technical definitions, but are often miss-used in hurried or short-hand presentations. The main thing to remember is that exon and introns are features of DNA, whereas codons are features of RNA.\n[3] Silent Mutations are DNA mutations that do not result in a change to the amino acid sequence or a protein. They may occur in a non-coding region (outside of a gene or within an intron), or they may occur within an exon in a manner that does not alter the final amino acid chain.he word biology means, the science of life, from the Greek bios, life, and logos, word or knowledge. Therefore, Biology is the science of Living Things. That is why Biology is sometimes known as Life Science.\n[4] By definition, exons and introns are sequences in a protein-coding gene region of a double-stranded DNA molecule (dsDNA) that are expressed as proteins, or intervening sequences not so expressed. The exon and intron sequences are typicallly visualized as the Sense Strand of the dsDNA, written 5'-3', left to right.\n[5] Molecular Biology & DNA. Q: A: An intron is a nucleotide sequence found within the genes and is removed via RNA splicing when a mature RNA molecule is being generated; on the other hand, an exon is a nucleic acid sequence present in a mature messenger RNA molecule.\n[6] Muro, A.

Journal of Cell Biology 162: 149\u00e2\u0080\u0093160.\n[7] In molecular biology, splicing is the editing of the nascent pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) transcript. After splicing, introns are removed and exons are joined together (ligated). For nuclear-encoded genes, splicing takes place within the nucleus either co-transcriptionally or immediately after transcription.\n[8] Priya Rani Verma, 6-Years teaching experience of Biology/Biotechnology Answered Apr 5, 2016 \u00c2\u00b7 Author has 126 answers and 220.6k answer views Introns and exons were discovered independently by American molecular biologists Richard Roberts and Phillip Sharp in 1977.\n[9] Exon definition may facilitate splice site selection in RNAs with multiple exons.

The average number of exons in human genes is about 8-10 and the mean value of 8.8 exons per gene. Exon lengths are distributed much more tightly (S.D.=192.23 - 396.79) than introns on each chromosome (see below).The average exon length is about 170bp.tarting with 26,564 genes, we filtered out 233,785 exons and 207,344 introns from the human genome. The results of exon (exons in the coding region) and intron (introns between the coding exons) distributions were tabulated for further analysis.\n[11] For other uses, see Exon (disambiguation) .

Description: In most eukaryotic genes, coding regions (exons) are interrupted by noncoding regions (introns). During transcription, the entire gene is copied into a pre-mRNA, which includes exons and introns.\n[14] Exons. Exons are the nucleotide sequences of genes that are expressed, and those are found at either sides of an intron. In simple terms, it could be stated that exons really hit the ground in the expression of genes or in the protein synthesis.The polypeptide strand is formed based on the nucleotide sequence in exons. Exons are found at the two ends of a gene while introns are always found inside the gene. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 When mutations take place, introns sometimes contribute nucleotides but usually not the other way around. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Both DNA and RNA contain introns and exons, but mature RNA only contain exons and not the introns.\n[15] Introns and exons are parts of genes. Exons code for proteins, whereas introns do not. A great way to remember this is by considering introns as intervening sequences and exons as expressed sequences. According to researchers, there are an average of 8.8 exons and 7.8 introns per human gene.\n[16] Introns and exons are parts of genes. Exons code for proteins, whereas introns do not.

On RALY exon 4, SRSF1 depletion resulted in exon inclusion, but SRSF2 depletion induced exon skipping, and the converse was true on the MLF1 exon 3 ( Figure 4C, bottom right panel).\n[19] The 26,564 annotated genes in the human genome (build October, 2003) contain 233,785 exons and 207,344 introns. On average, there are 8.8 exons and 7.8 introns per gene. About 80% of the exons on each chromosome are r = 0.95 and r = 0.97, respectively. These results suggest their implication in genome design.tarting with 26,564 genes, we filtered out 233,785 exons and 207,344 introns from the human genome.

The decreased heart function can affect the lungs, liver, and other body systems. DCM is one of the cardiomyopathies, a group of diseases that affect primarily the heart muscle. Different cardiomyopathies have different causes and affect the heart in different ways. In DCM a portion of the myocardium is dilated, often without any obvious cause. Left or right ventricular systolic pump function of the heart is impaired, leading to progressive heart enlargement via ventricular hypertrophy and ventricular dilation, a process called ventricular remodeling. Dilated cardiomyopathy is the most common form of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy.\n[3] Left ventricular hypertrophy can develop in response to some factor \u00e2\u0080\u0094 such as high blood pressure or a heart condition \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that causes the left ventricle to work harder.

The volume overload (due to elevated pulse pressure and the systemic effects of neuroendocrine hormones) causes left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).\n[7] Best Answer: By teenage and adult ages, the walls of the left ventricle have thickened to three to six times greater than that of the right ventricle. Rowers, cyclists, and cross-country skiers tend to have the largest hearts, with an average left ventricular wall thickness of 1.3 centimeters. Normal thickness of the left ventricular myocardium is from 0.6 to 1.1 cm (as measured at the very end of diastole. If the myocardium is more than 1.1 cm thick, the diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) can be made.\n[8] What is left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)? The right and left sides of your heart do different jobs. The right side takes in blood that has travelled round the body and pumps it to the lungs. From here, the blood enters the left side of the heart from where it is pumped all round your body. Because the left side of the heart has to work harder to get blood round your body, it is usually this side that becomes enlarged when your blood pressure is too high. This is sometimes called left ventricular hypertrophy or LVH for short. In other words, it is another name for an enlarged heart. People with high blood pressure and an enlarged left side of the heart have four times the risk of a heart attack than someone with the same blood pressure but a normal-sized heart.\n[9] Left ventricular hypertrophy is a thickening of the wall of the heart's main pumping chamber. This thickening may result in elevation of pressure within the heart and sometimes poor pumping action. The most common cause is high blood pressure.\n[10] Several underlying conditions can contribute to or influence the enlargement of the heart muscle in the left ventricle. Hypertension is the most common cause, setting the stage for left ventricular hypertrophy once a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blood pressure exceeds the normal level of 140/90 mm Hg. Aside from hypertension, the condition known as aortic valve stenosis is also a common cause of the hypertrophic changes in the heart.\n[11] A. HYPERTENSIVE CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE.

Recent studies suggest that cardiomegaly is associated with a higher risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD).n this condition, the walls of both the left and right side of the heart (ventricles) become thin and stretched. The result is an enlarged heart. In the other types of cardiomegaly, the heart's large muscular left ventricle becomes abnormally thick. Hypertrophy is the usually what causes left ventricular enlargement.\n[19] As enlargement progresses, though, the heart's pumping ability declines. Dilated cardiomyopathy is the main type of cardiomegaly. In dilated cardiomyopathy, the walls of both the left and right side of the heart (ventricles) become thin and stretched. The result is an enlarged heart. In the other types of enlarged heart, the heart's muscular left ventricle becomes abnormally thick. High blood pressure usually causes left ventricular enlargement (hypertrophy), while hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is an inherited condition.\n[20] Right ventricular hypertrophy. Right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) is a form of ventricular hypertrophy affecting the right ventricle. Blood travels through the right ventricle to the lungs via the pulmonary arteries. If conditions occur which decrease pulmonary circulation, meaning blood does not flow well from the heart to the lungs, extra stress can be placed on the right ventricle. This can lead to right ventricular hypertrophy.\nSearch Query: causes of left ventricular hypertrophy.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

ST depression in general means subendocardial ischemia, meaning mild ischemia. However, it can also be due to changes in repolarization due to left ventricular hypertrophy depending on which EKG leads the ST depression in found in. So it is plausible that you have some left ventricular hypertrophy as a result of exercise and that is resulting in ST depression.\n[2] Causes of Right Ventricular Hypertrophy. There are four usual causes of right ventricular hypertrophy. The first one is pulmonary hypertension. As stated earlier, pulmonary hypertension is a condition wherein the blood pressure increases in the pulmonary artery. And this can lead to shortness of breath, dizziness and fainting.\n[3] Patients who present with a thickened left ventricle are likely suffering from left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). There are a few different causes of LVH. It is a strong indicator of potential coronary complications, and there is a strong correlation between certain types of LVH and morbidity and mortality.\n[4] In the other types of cardiomegaly, the heart's large muscular left ventricle becomes abnormally thick. Hypertrophy is usually what causes left ventricular enlargement. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is typically an inherited condition. There are many techniques and tests used to diagnose an enlarged heart.\n[5] The ventricles are the chambers in the heart responsible for pumping blood either to the lungs (right ventricle) or to the rest of the body (left ventricle). Ventricular hypertrophy may be divided into two categories: concentric (maladaptive) hypertrophy and eccentric (adaptive) hypertrophy.\n[6] Chronic hypertension is the most common cause of diastolic dysfunction and failure. It leads to left ventricular hypertrophy and increased connective tissue content, both of which decrease cardiac compliance.\n[7] Left ventricular hypertrophy that is caused by aortic valve stenosis might require surgery to repair the narrow valve or to replace it with an artificial or tissue valve. Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic\n[8] In this condition, the walls of both the left and right side of the heart (ventricles) become thin and stretched. The result is an enlarged heart. In the other types of cardiomegaly, the heart's large muscular left ventricle becomes abnormally thick. Hypertrophy is the usually what causes left ventricular enlargement. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is typically an inherited condition.\n[9] High blood pressure forces your heart to work harder than necessary in order to pump blood to the rest of your body. This causes the left ventricle to thicken or stiffen (left ventricular hypertrophy). These changes limit the ventricle's ability to pump blood to your body.\n[10] Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a condition in which the muscle wall of heart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s left pumping chamber (ventricle) becomes thickened (hypertrophy). Learn more about symptoms, diagnosing and treatment options from the experts at Cleveland Clinic.\n[11] Left ventricular hypertrophy can develop in response to some factor \u00e2\u0080\u0094 such as high blood pressure or a heart condition \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that causes the left ventricle to work harder. As the workload increases, the muscle tissue in the chamber wall thickens, and sometimes the size of the chamber itself also increases.\n[12] Left ventricular hypertrophy is a thickening of the wall of the heart's main pumping chamber. This thickening may result in elevation of pressure within the heart and sometimes poor pumping action. The most common cause is high blood pressure.\n[13] Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) occurs when the muscle tissue in the heart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main pumping chamber becomes enlarged. LVH is often caused by high blood pressure or other heart problems and can lead to serious complications, such as heart disease, heart attack and heart failure.\n[14] Over time, this can cause the heart muscle to thicken. As the heart pumps against elevated pressure in the blood vessels, the left ventricle becomes enlarged and the amount of blood pumped by the heart each minute (cardiac output) goes down, a condition called left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Without treatment, this can lead to heart failure.\n[15] Several underlying conditions can contribute to or influence the enlargement of the heart muscle in the left ventricle. Hypertension is the most common cause, setting the stage for left ventricular hypertrophy once a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blood pressure exceeds the normal level of 140/90 mm Hg. Aside from hypertension, the condition known as aortic valve stenosis is also a common cause of the hypertrophic changes in the heart.\n[16] Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a condition in which the heart becomes enlarged and cannot pump blood efficiently. The decreased heart function can affect the lungs, liver, and other body systems. DCM is one of the cardiomyopathies, a group of diseases that affect primarily the heart muscle. Different cardiomyopathies have different causes and affect the heart in different ways. In DCM a portion of the myocardium is dilated, often without any obvious cause. Left or right ventricular systolic pump function of the heart is impaired, leading to progressive heart enlargement via ventricular hypertrophy and ventricular dilation, a process called ventricular remodeling. Dilated cardiomyopathy is the most common form of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy.\n[17] What is left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)? The right and left sides of your heart do different jobs. The right side takes in blood that has travelled round the body and pumps it to the lungs. From here, the blood enters the left side of the heart from where it is pumped all round your body. Because the left side of the heart has to work harder to get blood round your body, it is usually this side that becomes enlarged when your blood pressure is too high. This is sometimes called left ventricular hypertrophy or LVH for short. In other words, it is another name for an enlarged heart. People with high blood pressure and an enlarged left side of the heart have four times the risk of a heart attack than someone with the same blood pressure but a normal-sized heart.\n[18] Treatment for left ventricular hypertrophy depends on the underlying cause, and may involve medication or surgery. Treating high blood pressure Your doctor is likely to recommend lifestyle changes, including:\n[19] Left ventricular hypertrophy that is caused by aortic valve stenosis might require surgery to repair the narrow valve or to replace it with an artificial or tissue valve. 1 Tests and diagnosis. 2 Lifestyle and home remedies.\n[20] Aortic insufficiency causes both volume overload (elevated preload) and pressure overload (elevated afterload due to increased stroke volume) of the heart. The volume overload (due to elevated pulse pressure and the systemic effects of neuroendocrine hormones) causes left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).\nSearch Query: causes of left ventricular hypertrophy.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Left ventricular hypertrophy was absent in one case only (case 2).\n[3] Ventricular hypertrophy. Ventricular hypertrophy (VH) is thickening of the walls of a ventricle (lower chamber) of the heart.[1][2] Although left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is more common, right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), as well as concurrent hypertrophy of both ventricles can also occur.\n[4] Left Ventricular Hypertrophy. Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH) causes a similar pattern of repolarization abnormalities as LBBB, with ST elevation in the leads with deep S-waves (usually V1-3) and ST depression/T-wave inversion in the leads with tall R waves (I, aVL, V5-6).\n[5] Lifestyle changes can help lower your blood pressure and improve left ventricular hypertrophy signs. Consider: Weight loss. Left ventricular hypertrophy is often found in obese people regardless of blood pressure. Losing weight has been shown to reverse left ventricular hypertrophy. Limiting salt in your diet.\n[6] Left ventricular hypertrophy is more common in people who have uncontrolled high blood pressure. But no matter what your blood pressure is, developing left ventricular hypertrophy puts you at higher risk for a heart attack and stroke. Treating high blood pressure can help ease your symptoms and may reverse left ventricular hypertrophy.\n[7] Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is thickening of the heart muscle of the left ventricle of the heart, that is, left-sided ventricular hypertrophy.\n[8] Ventricular hypertrophy (VH) is thickening of the walls of a ventricle (lower chamber) of the heart. Although left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is more common, right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), as well as concurrent hypertrophy of both ventricles can also occur.\n[9] The last common cause of right ventricular hypertrophy is the ventricular septal defect. This is a disease affecting the ventricular septum. The ventricular septum, on the other hand, is the wall that divides the right and left ventricles of the heart.\n[10] Ventricular hypertrophy is thickening of the walls of a ventricle of the heart. Although left ventricular hypertrophy is more common, right ventricular hypertrophy, as well as concurrent hypertrophy of both ventricles can also occur. Ventricular hypertrophy can result from a variety of conditions, both adaptive and maladaptive.

It refers to a group of disorders that includes heart failure, ischemic heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, and left ventricular hypertrophy (excessive thickening of the heart muscle).\n[12] What is Left Ventricular Hypertrophy? Left ventricular hypertrophy is a disorder of the heart involving the enlargement or thickening of the wall of cardiac muscle situated in the chamber of the heart known as the left ventricle.\n[13] Patient Information. Left Ventricular Hypertrophy on ECG. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) means that the muscle of the left pumping chamber of the heart (left ventricle) is thickened. The left ventricle's job is to pump blood to the body, and conditions that increase the work the left ventricle has to do can lead to thickening of the muscle.\n[14] Left ventricular hypertrophy may cause or facilitate many cardiac complications of hypertension, including congestive heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and sudden death. Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, which may present with all of the symptoms and signs of congestive heart failure, is common in patients with long-standing hypertension.\n[15] Left ventricular hypertrophy is thought to be the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in the adult population. This is most commonly the result of longstanding high blood pressure which has caused secondary damage to the wall of the main pumping chamber of the heart, the left ventricle.\n[16] Sound waves produce live-action images of your heart. Echocardiogram can reveal thickened muscle tissue in the left ventricle, blood flow through the heart with each beat, and heart abnormalities related to left ventricular hypertrophy, such as aortic valve stenosis. MRI. Images of your heart can be used to diagnose left ventricular hypertrophy.\n[17] Symptoms. Left ventricular hypertrophy usually develops gradually. You may experience no signs or symptoms, especially during the early stages of the condition. As left ventricular hypertrophy progresses, you may experience: Shortness of breath; Fatigue; Chest pain, often after exercising; Sensation of rapid, fluttering or pounding heartbeats (palpitations)\n[18] Left ventricular hypertrophy usually develops gradually. You may experience no signs or symptoms, especially during the early stages of the condition. As left ventricular hypertrophy progresses, you may experience: 1 Shortness of breath. 2 Fatigue. 3 Chest pain, often after exercising. 4 Sensation of rapid, fluttering or pounding heartbeats (palpitations). 5 Dizziness or fainting.\n[19] In this condition, the walls of the left and/or right ventricles of the heart become thin and stretched. The result is an enlarged heart. In the other types of cardiomegaly, the heart's large muscular left ventricle becomes abnormally thick. Hypertrophy is usually what causes left ventricular enlargement.\n[20] Common causes of Myocardial infarction.

In hypertrophy the heart muscle becomes thicker. This can have different causes. Left ventricular hypertrophy results from an increase in left ventricular workload, e.g., during hypertension or aortic valve stenosis. Right ventricular hypertrophy results from an increase in right ventricular workload, e.g., emphysema or pulmonary embolization. These causes are fundamentally different from hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HCM), which is a congenital misalignment of cardiomyocytes, resulting in hypertrophy.\n[3] Ventricular hypertrophy. Ventricular hypertrophy (VH) is thickening of the walls of a ventricle (lower chamber) of the heart. Although left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is more common, right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) can also occur, as can hypertrophy of both ventricles, that is, biventricular hypertrophy (BVH). Ventricular hypertrophy can be part of various syndromes caused by any of various underlying diseases.\n[4] Left ventricular hypertrophy can occur when some factor makes your heart work harder than normal to pump blood to your body. Factors that can cause your heart to work harder include: High blood pressure (hypertension). This is the most common cause of left ventricular hypertrophy. More than one-third of people show evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy at the time of their diagnosis with hypertension. Aortic valve stenosis.\n[5] By Mayo Clinic Staff.

Symptoms of Right Ventricular Hypertrophy\n[7] Left ventricular hypertrophy is enlargement and thickening (hypertrophy) of the walls of your heart's main pumping chamber (left ventricle). Left ventricular hypertrophy can develop in response to some factor \u00e2\u0080\u0094 such as high blood pressure or a heart condition \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that causes the left ventricle to work harder. As the workload increases, the muscle tissue in the chamber wall thickens, and sometimes the size of the chamber itself also increases.\n[8] Right ventricular hypertrophy. Description, Causes and Risk Factors: Abbreviation: RVH. Right ventricular hypertrophy is the increase or the enlargement in the size of the right ventricle of the heart. The right ventricle is responsible for pumping blood towards the lungs. In the lungs, blood is mixed with oxygen and then pumped back to the left ventricle to be eventually distributed to the brain and to other parts of the body. There are several possible causes of right ventricular hypertrophy.\n[9] Factors that can cause your heart to work harder include: 1 High blood pressure (hypertension).

Theraderm Skin Renewal System is described as a total skincare system that may produce younger looking skin. This 5-product system is said to reduce fine lines, take care of rough skin and address sun damage. However, this system has received some low scores on consumer-driven websites that rate anti-aging products, which makes us wonder if this system does not live up to expectations.\n[2] The main ingredient in this Theraderm cream is lanolin, which is a chemical obtained from sheep\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wool. Lanolin is often used in skin care products because of its ability to boost the natural moisture barrier, as well as the ability to draw moisture to the application site.\n[3] Nowadays there are many skin care brands, like Theraderm, which are actively promoted by doctors and dermatologists. This is an interesting approach, because it boosts the image of the products through the associated skin care expertise of a doctor.\n[4] In the case of Theraderm, this is taken even further, as the brand was founded by a plastic surgeon, Dr. James Beckman. However, even though this brand was created by a doctor, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean that the products are the right choice for everyone.\n[5] Theraderm is a manufacturer of clinical-grade skin care products, including anti-aging creams and moisturizers, as well as an acne system under an alternate brand: Reversion.

Progress in the molecular characterization of AML has largely focused on this group of patients, and the findings show that the majority of CN-AML patients now have a detectable recurrent genetic mutation (Table 1).\n[5] Untreated adult AML. In untreated adult AML, the disease is newly diagnosed. It has not been treated except to relieve signs and symptoms such as fever, bleeding, or pain, and the following are true: 1 The complete blood count is abnormal. 2 At least 20% of the cells in the bone marrow are blasts (leukemia cells).dult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes abnormal myeloblasts (a type of white blood cell), red blood cells, or platelets.

Surveillance means continued watchfulness over the distribution and trends of incidence through the systematic collection, consolidation, and evaluation of morbidity reports and other relevant data for the purposes of prevention of disease.\n[9] AML patients with these genetic disorders have a better prognosis. Six percent to 8% of patients with AML have structural alterations of 11q23, leading to the MLL rearrangement. The MLL gene rearrangement, also known as mixed lineage leukemia, may lead to AML composed of both myeloid and lymphoid cells.\n[10] I am the creator and owner of the LinkedIn Groups \u00e2\u0080\u009cACAMS / CAMS Exam Study Forum (unofficial)\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cAML Investigators\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Forum\u00e2\u0080\u009d.

In adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the subtype of AML and whether the leukemia has spread outside the blood and bone marrow are used instead of the stage to plan treatment.\n[19] Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a blood cancer. It happens when young abnormal white blood cells called blasts (leukemia cells), begin to fill up the bone marrow, preventing normal blood production. Doctors diagnose AML when 20 out of every 100 white blood cells in the bone marrow is a blast cell. AML is the most common acute leukemia affecting adults, with about 20,000 new cases diagnosed each year. When people have AML, blasts make copies of themselves quickly. This slows the production of red blood cells and platelets, causing tiredness from anemia and a risk of bleeding from a low platelet count.\n[20] Adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes abnormal myeloblasts (a type of white blood cell), red blood cells, or platelets.

Several groups of plants later developed pitted tracheid cells, it seems, through convergent evolution.\n[9] The most distinctive xylem cells are the long tracheary elements that transport water. Tracheids and vessel elements are distinguished by their shape; vessel elements are shorter, and are connected together into long tubes that are called vessels. Xylem also contains two other cell types: parenchyma and fibers.\n[10] Vascular Tissue. Vascular Tissue.

Angiosperm: class of plants that has the seeds enclosed in an ovary; includes flowering plants.\n[15] Ascent of sap. The ascent of sap in the xylem tissue of plants is the upward movement of water and minerals from the root to the crown. Xylem is a complex tissue consisting of living and non-living cells. The conducting cells in xylem are typically non-living and include, in various groups of plants, vessels members and tracheids.\n[16] Xylem vessels have several adaption that make them better for transporting water rather than tracheids. The adaptions ensure that water meets less resistance in xylem vessels. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Adaptions: 1. No nucleus. 2.

In the xylem or woody tissue, most of the cells are dead and the thick-walled tubes (tracheids) serve to transport water and dissolved minerals from the roots to the stems and leaves. The phloem cells provide the principal means of downward conduction of foods from the leaves.\n[18] Xylem and Phloem are complex because they are made different cells, with different roles. Xylem is made up of tracheids, parenchyma and xylem vessels. They conduct water and minerals up, give mechanical support and store food for the the plant and plant tissue. All these types of cells are different yet work as a unit, in combination and in coordination.\n[19] Tracheids and vessel members are referred to as tracheary elements.

Tracheids are the more primitive of the two cell types, occurring in the earliest vascular plants.arenchyma cells also occur within the xylem and phloem of vascular bundles. The largest parenchyma cells occur in the pith region, often, as in corn (Zea) stems, being larger than the vascular bundles. In many prepared slides they stain green.\n[20] In most plants, pitted tracheids function as the primary transport cells. The other type of tracheary element, besides the tracheid, is the vessel element. Vessel elements are joined by perforations into vessels. In vessels, water travels by bulk flow, as in a pipe, rather than by diffusion through cell membranes.t also allows plants to draw water from the root through the xylem to the leaf. Water is constantly lost through transpiration from the leaf.

Xylem vessels are tubelike structures joined end to end. Tracheids are elongated narrow cells. they are dead cells.Water and minerals move upwards through vessels and tracheids. Fibres are long cells with thick walls and narrow cavities.\n[4] Tracheid of oak shows pits along the walls. It is longer than a vessel element and has no perforation plates. Tracheids are elongated cells in the xylem of vascular plants that serve in the transport of water and mineral salts.Tracheids are one of two types of tracheary elements, vessel elements being the other. Tracheids, unlike vessel elements, do not have perforation plates.racheids provide most of the structural support in softwoods, where they are the major cell type. Because tracheids have a much higher surface to volume ratio compared to vessel elements, they serve to hold water against gravity (by adhesion) when transpiration is not occurring.\n[5] Its major components include xylem parenchyma, xylem fibers, tracheids, and xylem vessels. Tracheids are one of the two types of tracheary elements of vascular plants. (The other being the vessel elements). A tracheid cell loses its protoplast at maturity.

Xylem cells in the stem carry water from a plant's roots to its leaves.\n[17] As a complex tissue, it is composed of four cell types: vessel elements, tracheids, parenchyma cells and fibers. Vessel elements, non-living, barrel-like cells, and tracheids, non-living, tapered cells, are the actual water-conducting cells of xylem tissue. The parenchyma cells function in storage and the fibers function in support. Phloem transports the carbohydrate products (sugars) of photosynthesis throughout the plant.\n[18] Several types of cells make up xylem tissue, including parenchyma as well as the tracheids and vessel members, two cell types that specialize in transferring water and minerals.

You might think that large trees would have wide vessels and tracheids, so that water filters fast through the tree, but actually its the opposite. Trees have narrow vessels and tracheids so that water filters slowly up the tree. This indeed is less efficient at carrying water, but wider vessels are more likely to cavitate. In a woody plant, the trunk is almost entirely composed of vessels and tracheids. Tracheids differ from vessels in being much narrower\n[3] Tracheids and vessel elements form tube-shaped structures that provide pathways for water and minerals to travel from the roots to the leaves.

Operating margin is what a company makes on each dollar of sales before interest and taxes. Profit margin is net income divided by revenue. So, Wal-Mart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operating margin is ~5.7% as you state, but its profit margin is ~3.37%.\n[20] What is 'Net Profit Margin'. Net profit margin is the ratio of net profits to revenues for a company or business segment . Typically expressed as a percentage, net profit margins show how much of each dollar collected by a company as revenue translates into profit. The equation to calculate net profit margin is: net margin = net profit / revenue.\nSearch Query: what is a active margin.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Marginal utility, then, asks how much a one-unit change in a variable will impact our utility (that is, our level of happiness. In other words, marginal utility measures incremental utility received from one additional unit of consumption. Marginal utility analysis answers questions such as: How much happier, in terms of 'utils', will an additional dollar make me (that is, what is the marginal utility of money?) How much less happy, in terms of 'utils', will working an additional hour make me (that is, what is the marginal disutility of labor?)\n[10] A continental margin that has a broad continental shelf, a gentle continental slope, and a pronounced continental rise is known as a passive continental margin.

In this activity, students use the GeoMapApp tool to work with earthquake, volcano, and topographic data to identify active and passive margins. 1 Utilize earthquake data to locate subducting slabs.\n[3] Passive margin. A passive margin is the transition between oceanic and continental lithosphere that is not an active plate margin. A passive margin forms by sedimentation above an ancient rift, now marked by transitional lithosphere. Continental rifting creates new ocean basins.\n[4] Marginal analysis is an examination of the additional benefits of an activity compared to the additional costs incurred by that same activity.

Gross margin is the profit you actually earn when you sell it after any discounting or markdowns; it is frequently called maintained margin. This spread will be specific to your business, depending upon your level of promotional and clearance activity. Margin erosion will naturally occur unless you actively manage your markup percentages. Several factors can cause overall margins to erode, including: competitive price pressures forcing below-standard markups; vendor price increases pushing retail prices up against natural price points; and unanticipated shifts in sales mix toward lower-priced and lower-margin merchandise.\n[9] The continental margins along India and Antarctica are other examples of passive margins. A continental margin that has a very narrow, or even nonexistent, continental shelf and a narrow and steep continental slope is known as an active continental margin.

The trench marks the deepest seaward termination of the active continental margin. It coincides with the surface trace of the subduction fault marking the boundary between the converging plates.\n[10] the continental margin is the submerged outer edge of a continent it is generally divided into two sections the continental shelf and the continental slope the continental shelf is the region that extends seaward from the shoreline to a sharp drop off that marks the beginning of the continental slope continental margin that has a broad continental shelf a gentle continental slope and a pronounced continental rise is known as a passive continental margin this type of margin experiences little if any volcanic or earthquake activity the build up of sediment is the primary activity affecting a passive margin\n[11] An active continental margin is found on the leading edge of the continent where it is crashing into an oceanic plate. An excellent example is the west coast of South America. Active margins are commonly the sites of tectonic activity: earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain building, and the formation of new igneous rock.\n[12] Profile illustrating the shelf, slope and rise. The continental margin is the zone of the ocean floor that separates the thin oceanic crust from thick continental crust.Together, the continental shelf, continental slope, and continental rise are called continental margin. Continental margins constitute about 28% of the oceanic area.arthquakes and volcanic eruptions are common on the west coast of North America, but there are no active volcanoes on the east coast and large magnitude earthquakes are rare. Geologists refer to the west coast as (tectonically) active continental margin and the east coast a passive continental margin.\n[13] Active continental margin: A continental margin that has a very narrow, or even nonexistent, continental shelf and a narrow and steep continental slope that ends in a deep trench instead of a continental rise; it is marked by earthquake and volcanic activity.\n[14] Active Margins. occur where oceanic lithosphere is being subducted beneath the edge of the continent. the result is a relatively narrow margin that consists of highly deformed sediment that was scraped from the decending lithospheric slab and plastered against the margin of the overriding continent.\n[15] The overall rate may be extremely slow (one to ten centimeters per year), but the long term effect is a continual re-shaping of the surface of our planet. An active continental margin is found on the leading edge of the continent where it is crashing into an oceanic plate. An excellent example is the west coast of South America. Active margins are commonly the sites of tectonic activity: earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain building, and the formation of new igneous rock.\n[16] The transition from continental to oceanic crust commonly occurs within the outer part of the margin, called continental rise. Oceanwards beyond the edge of the rise lies the abyssal plain.arthquakes and volcanic eruptions are common on the west coast of North America, but there are no active volcanoes on the east coast and large magnitude earthquakes are rare. Geologists refer to the west coast as (tectonically) active continental margin and the east coast a passive continental margin.\n[17] The continental margins along India and Antarctica are other examples of passive margins. A continental margin that has a very narrow, or even nonexistent, continental shelf and a narrow and steep continental slope is known as an active continental margin. Instead of ending in a continental rise, the continental slope of this type of margin often plunges into a deep-ocean trench, which may be filled with sediment.\n[18] A continental margin that has a broad continental shelf, a gentle continental slope, and a pronounced continental rise is known as a passive continental margin. This type of margin experiences little, if any, volcanic or earthquake activity. The build-up of sediment is the primary activity affecting a passive margin.he continental shelf is the region that extends seaward from the shoreline to a sharp drop-off that marks the beginning of the continental slope. That drop-off is known as the continental shelf break. Continental shelves vary in width from 3 to 930 miles (5 to 1,500 kilometers).\n[19] Activity at the Margins of a Batholith. Pegmatites form from waters that separate from a magma in the late stages of crystallization; this activity often occurs in small pockets along the margins of a batholith. Pegmatite can also form in fractures that develop on the margins of the batholith. This is how \u00e2\u0080\u009cpegmatite dikes\u00e2\u0080\u009d are formed.\n[20] Activity at the Margins of a Batholith Pegmatites form from waters that separate from a magma in the late stages of crystallization; this activity often occurs in small pockets along the margins of a batholith.\nSearch Query: what is a active margin.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Active margins are the site of volcanic and earthquake activity. 12 Continental Margins\n[3] Two types of continental margins exist: active margins and passive margins. Active margins form primarily along the boundaries of plates that are actively converging. Passive margins currently exist in the middle of plates, not at plate boundaries.\n[4] Financial analysis.

Companies use marginal analysis as a decision-making tool to help them maximize their profits. Individuals unconsciously use marginal analysis to make a host of everyday decisions.\n[8] As fixed costs are incurred regardless of the level of activity the purpose of marginal costing is to determine what contribution is been generated (sales less variable costs). Using the previous example prepare a marginal costing profit statement for the months of May and June.\n[9] Both passive and active continental margins are located near coastlines. The main difference is that active margins are the main sites where tectonic activity takes place (lik \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 e earthquakes). This is because the continental shelf of active continental margins collide with an oceanic plate, creating subduction.\n[10] Active continental margins form primarily along the boundaries of plates that are actively converging and where one plate is sinking beneath the other. Active margins mark the continents that border the Pacific Ocean where oceanic plates are subducting beneath continental plates.assive continental margin: A continental margin that has a broad continental shelf, a gentle continental slope, and a pronounced continental rise; it is marked by a lack of earthquake and volcanic activity. Plates: Large sections of Earth's lithosphere separated by deep fault zones.\n[11] Making the world better, one answer at a time. Passive continental margins are not areas of convergence. There is little volcanic and earthquake activity on passive margins. Active margins are areas of convergence where one plate is descending beneath another. They are associated with volcanic and earthquake activity.\n[12] All three margins are seismically active, with volcanic activity at constructive and destructive margins. Some plate margins exhibit features of more than one of the three main types and are known as combined plate margins. See PLATE TECTONICS; and SEA-FLOOR SPREADING.\n[13] A continental margin that has a broad continental shelf, a gentle continental slope, and a pronounced continental rise is known as a passive continental margin. This type of margin experiences little, if any, volcanic or earthquake activity. The build-up of sediment is the primary activity affecting a passive margin.\n[14] 1 A Continental Margin is a boundary between continental crust and oceanic crust. 2 Active continental margins occur along plate boundaries, while passive continental margins occur at the boundary that marks a continent and the oceanic crust. 3 Mountain building takes place along active continental margins only.\n[15] best answer an active continental margin is found on the leading edge of the continent where it is crashing into an oceanic platean excellent example is the west coast of south americaactive margins are commonly the sites of tectonic activity earthquakes volcanoes mountain building and the formation of new igneous rockn excellent example is the west coast of south america active margins are commonly the sites of tectonic activity earthquakes volcanoes mountain building and the formation of new igneous rock\n[16] An active continental margin is found on the leading edge of the continent where it is crashing into an oceanic plate.

Dental insurance typically does not cover dental contouring, which is considered purely cosmetic. However, tooth contouring might sometimes be covered if the reshaping is required after an accident or injury. Related articles: Dental Bonding, Teeth Whitening, Dental Veneers, Braces: What should be included: 1 The improvements provided by tooth shaping can be subtle. 2 Dental contouring is relatively pain-free, and is often done in one visit to the dentist. 3 Dental contouring is not a substitute for braces or other procedures that make major changes in the position or appearance of teeth.\n[2] J.

While that is what my family used during the steam era, as well as all of our neighbors, I remember Dad saying, A moldboard plow would plow too deep ruining the ground..\n[4] Tillage and planting practices that reduce erosion include contour cultivation and strip-cropping. Contour cultivation is cultivation that follows the contours of a field, producing furrows that run perpendicular or at angles to the slope-line of a field.heet erosion is caused by raindrops. Sheet erosion is defined as the uniform removal of soil in thin layers from sloping land. This, of course, is nearly impossible; in reality the loose soil merely runs off with the rain.\n[5] What Cotton is Used For. Every part of the cotton plant can be used. The long cotton fibers are used to make cloth, the short fibers can be used in the paper industry.

The beam may be of either wood or steel, depending on when the plow was manufactured, or in some cases, on the intended kind of soil to be plowed.\n[10] Unless you advertise that you have started a snow plowing business, you and your plow will sit idly all winter long. The extent of the advertising effort is up to you. It can be as simple as placing fliers on every car or mailbox you see to purchasing space in the local phone book.he effectiveness of your snow plowing service will depend on the character of your plow.

Contour cultivation is cultivation that follows the contours of a field, producing furrows that run perpendicular or at angles to the slope-line of a field.heet erosion is caused by raindrops. Sheet erosion is defined as the uniform removal of soil in thin layers from sloping land. This, of course, is nearly impossible; in reality the loose soil merely runs off with the rain.\n[12] Tilling the field at right angles to the natural slope after drawing up the elevation contour lines is called contour ploughing in soil, prevents and reduces soil erosion.

They are the lines that reflect the movement of your eye in and around what you see. While contour lines describe edges, cross-contours describe form and volume. These lines can follow planes of form, moving around and across objects as well as through them. Think of a topographical map--the lines move across the terrain. Cross-contour lines do the same thing.\n[5] With a one-bottom plow you'll make one furrow at a time, with a two-bottom plow two at a time, and so on. Since a two-bottom plow will cut the number of passes you have to make up and down the field by 50 percent, it's well worth getting if you can. But again, don't buy a bigger plow than your tractor can handle.low. You may find your first major tractor attachment, the plow, comes with the tractor. This is because of the two major types, trailer plows and mounted plows ... the latter, as its name implies, comes mounted on the tractor.

CoolSculpting works best if you have areas of fat that you wish to reduce or contour, and in most people will reduce fat by 20 to 30%.\n[7] The first hurdle to learning about your plow is over, but now comes the bigger challenge; What size and type of plow bottom is my plow equipped. There are basically two major types of plow bottoms; Conventional (primarily used before the mid 50's) and Modern HS or NU series (used from the early 1950's and up).\n[8] When it comes to plow shape, manufacturers have three basic options: straight, V and box. 1 Straight Plows: A straight blade is just what it sounds like. This option is great for small-scale applications that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t involve a ton of snow. 2 V-Plows: V-plows are great for making initial breaks in dense or high snow.\n[9] What is Exilis ELITE?

This method is also known for preventing tillage erosion. Tillage erosion is the soil movement and erosion by tilling a given plot of land. A similar practice is contour bunding where stones are placed around the contours of slopes.\n[2] Best Answer: 5) Which is the best way to prevent soil erosion on a farm? a) Plow fields along contour lines. 6) Freshwater is usually considered a renewable resource.

But in areas with drifting dry soil, furrowing across the direction of the wind can bring that wind erosion under control long enough for a crop to emerge and keep the soil there.\n[5] Which factors contributed to the dust bowl? Drought, dust storms, and intensive farming Later, scientists discovered that plowing along the contours of the land would have relieved some of the loss of topsoil.\n[6] Using farming methods such as no-till (seeds are planted without plowing the soil), crop rotation (legumes are alternated with high-nitrogen demand crops), and planting or conserving tree cover near croplands we can reduce the effect of wind and rain erosion of cropland.sing farming methods such as no-till (seeds are planted without plowing the soil), crop rotation (legumes are alternated with high-nitrogen demand crops), and planting or conserving tree cover near croplands we can reduce the effect of wind and rain erosion of cropland.\n[7] Contour plowing is also promoted in countries with similar rainfall patterns to the United States such as western Canada and Australia. The practice is effective only on slopes with between 2% and 10% gradient and when rainfall does not exceed a certain amount within a certain period.\n[8] A: Contour plowing conserves soil by following the lay of the land and creating ridges that form a water break to prevent soil erosion. Furrows that do not follow the lay of the land cause rapid runoff during rainfall by forming a convenient channel for the water to flow downhill.\n[9] In the property world, a contour is an outline of a mass of land.

Less plowing means less erosion, less run-off and fewer trips across the field.\n[11] Conservation tillage can be an economical option for farmers, plus provides a number of potential environmental benefits: 1 Reduced plowing makes cropland much less vulnerable to soil erosion: conservation tillage reduces soil erosion by as much as 90 percent, compared to systems using intensive tillage.\n[12] Tillage and planting practices that reduce erosion include contour cultivation and strip-cropping. Contour cultivation is cultivation that follows the contours of a field, producing furrows that run perpendicular or at angles to the slope-line of a field.heet erosion is caused by raindrops. Sheet erosion is defined as the uniform removal of soil in thin layers from sloping land. This, of course, is nearly impossible; in reality the loose soil merely runs off with the rain.\n[13] Tilling the field at right angles to the natural slope after drawing up the elevation contour lines is called contour ploughing in soil, prevents and reduces soil erosion. Terrace Farming In terracing, wide steps are cut around the slopes of hills to prevent soil erosion. Contour ploughing follows the \u00e2\u0080\u009cnatural shape\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the slope without altering it. Terrace farming alters the shape of the slope to produce flat areas that provide a catchment for water.\n[14] Plowing and planting across the changing slope of land, rather than in straight lines, to help retain water and reduce soil erosion. Method for reducing soil erosion; plant stalks are left in the field after harvesting and the next year's crop is planted within the stalks without plowing.\n[15] Conservation tillage systems (described below) can be an important part of a sustainable agricultural system, in that they can be used to decrease soil erosion losses ordinarily associated with typical US agricultural practices.onservation tillage is basically any system of cultivating that reduces soil or water loss when compared to conventional moldboard plowing, which turns over the soil completely.\n[16] Tilling the field at right angles to the natural slope after drawing up the elevation contour lines is called contour ploughing in soil, prevents and reduces soil erosion.

Two small case\u00e2\u0080\u0093control studies on risk factors for L. longbeachae pneumonia conducted in South Australia have been published (10,11).\n[2] About the Disease. Legionnaires' disease is a severe, often lethal, form of pneumonia. It's caused by the bacterium Legionella pneumophila found in both potable and nonpotable water systems.Each year, an estimated 10,000 to 18,000 people are infected with the Legionella bacteria in the United States.It is not uncommon for patients with Legionnaires' disease to be admitted to the intensive care unit. study of outbreak survivors showed persistence of fatigue (75%), neurologic symptoms (66%) and neuromuscular symptoms (63%) in months after an outbreak. See Share Your Story for a first-hand account of the severity of this disease.\n[3] Legionellosis is an infection that is caused by the bacterium Legionella pneumophila. The disease has two distinct forms: 1 Legionnaires' disease is the more severe form of the infection, which may involve pneumonia. 2 Pontiac fever is a milder illness that develops from hours to two days after initial infection and resolves spontaneously.\n[4] From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Legionella pneumophila is a thin, aerobic, pleomorphic, flagellated, nonspore-forming, Gram-negative bacterium of the genus Legionella. L. pneumophila is the primary human pathogenic bacterium in this group and is the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, also known as legionellosis. 1 Characterization.\n[5] Medical Definition of Legionnaire disease Our Legionnaires' Disease Main Article provides a comprehensive look at the who, what, when and how of Legionnaires' Disease Legionnaire disease: A disease due to the bacteria Legionella pneumophila found in plumbing, shower heads and water-storage tanks. Outbreaks of Legionella pneumonia have been attributed to evaporative condensers and cooling towers.\n[6] Pneumonia due to mycoplasma and chlamydophila bacteria is usually mild. 1 Pneumonia due to Legionella pneumophila gets worse during the first 4 to 6 days, and then improves over 4 to 5 days. Even though symptoms will improve, it may take a while for them to go away completely.\n[7] Medical Definition of legionella. 1 capitalized : a genus of gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria (family Legionellaceae) that includes the causative agent (L. pneumophila) of Legionnaires' disease. 2plural legionellae \\-\u00cb\u008c\u00c4\u0093\\ also legionellas : a bacterium of the genus Legionella.\n[8] Causes.

It is caused by Legionella bacteria. The bacteria that cause Legionnaire disease have been found in water delivery systems. They can survive in the warm, moist air conditioning systems of large buildings, including hospitals. Most cases are caused by the bacteria Legionella pneumophila. The rest of the cases are caused by other Legionella species.\n[12] Legionnaires' disease is a type of pneumonia. It is caused by bacteria called Legionella pneumophila. The bacteria got its name in 1976, when a group of people attending an American Legion convention became infected.ymptoms can range from mild to severe. Pontiac fever symptoms include fever and muscle aches. Symptoms usually appear 1 to 2 days after a person is exposed to the bacteria.\n[13] Legionnaires disease (LD) was recognized in 1976 after an outbreak of pneumonia at an American Legion convention in Philadelphia. Soon after, the etiologic agent was identified as a fastidious gram-negative bacillus and named Legionella pneumophila.\n[14] Legionnaires\u00e2\u0080\u0099 disease, or Legionellosis, is a severe infection caused by Legionella species, primarily L. pneumophila. In fact, L. pneumophila is responsible for 90% of infections.\n[15] Medical Definition of Legionnaire disease. Legionnaire disease: A disease due to the bacteria Legionella pneumophila found in plumbing, shower heads and water-storage tanks. Outbreaks of Legionella pneumonia have been attributed to evaporative condensers and cooling towers. The bacteria thrives in the mist sprayed from air-conditioning ducts and so it can infest an entire building or airplane. Travelers are especially vulnerable in the closed space within a plane.\n[16] The bacterium Legionella pneumophila is responsible for most cases of Legionnaires' disease. Outdoors, legionella bacteria survive in soil and water, but rarely cause infections.\n[17] Legionella is a type of bacteria that can cause a serious form of pneumonia called Legionnaires disease. Legionella testing detects the presence of the bacteria to help diagnose the cause of a person's pneumonia. legionella infection affects the lower respiratory tract, often requires hospitalization, and has a significant mortality rate. In addition to pneumonia, Legionella bacteria can also cause Pontiac fever, a milder and self-limiting illness with flu-like symptoms.\n[18] Much of the research done on Legionella pneumophila is related to ecology and how it relates to the environment. Some studies compare L. pneumophila to other microorganisms. Other studies look at the cases of Legionellosis and investigate the causes of the outbreaks.\n[19] Atypical organisms such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila are implicated in up to 40 percent of cases of community-acquired pneumonia.Antibiotic treatment is empiric and includes coverage for both typical and atypical organisms.ecause infection with an atypical pathogen is unlikely in children two months to five years of age, the recommended treatment in these patients is high-dose amoxicillin (80 to 90 mg per kg daily) for seven to 10 days.\n[20] Macrolides A.

Visceral structures are highly sensitive to stretch, ischemia and inflammation, but relatively insensitive to other stimuli that normally evoke pain in other structures, such as burning and cutting.\n[14] The lungs are surrounded by a double membrane called pleura. This membrane has two layers, a parietal pleura and a visceral pleura. The parietal pleura is attached to the chest wall and the visceral pleura covers the surface of the lungs.Between these layers of pleura is a potential space i.e. a space that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exist but it could exist if something goes wrong.his membrane has two layers, a parietal pleura and a visceral pleura. The parietal pleura is attached to the chest wall and the visceral pleura covers the surface of the lungs.\n[15] The visceral pleura is all of the serous membrane that is in direct contact with the lung. The parietal pleura is everything else. The same is true of the pericardium: if it directly touches the heart, it is visceral, but if it only contacts other tissue (including visceral pleura), it is parietal.\n[16] Most people think of the pericardium as just a double-layered, membranous sac (The Pericardial Cavity) that is around the heart. But, the pericardium is actually TRIPLE layered: the visceral layer, the parietal layer, and the fibrous layer (fibrosa).The visceral pericardium is the inner-most layer of the pericardium, and is also known as the Epicardium as it lays upon the heart.The Pericardial Cavity lies between the visceral pericardium and the parietal pericardium.he visceral pericardium is the inner-most layer of the pericardium, and is also known as the Epicardium as it lays upon the heart.\n[17] serous pericardium. the inner, serous portion of pericardium, consisting of two layers, visceral and parietal; the space between the layers is the pericardial cavity. visceral pericardium. the inner layer of the serous pericardium, which is intimately attached to the heart and roots of the great vessels.erous pericardium. the inner, serous portion of pericardium, consisting of two layers, visceral and parietal; the space between the layers is the pericardial cavity. visceral pericardium. the inner layer of the serous pericardium, which is intimately attached to the heart and roots of the great vessels.\n[18] serous pericardium the inner, serous portion of pericardium, consisting of two layers, visceral and parietal; the space between the layers is the pericardial cavity. visceral pericardium the inner layer of the serous pericardium, which is in contact with the heart and roots of the great vessels.Called also epicardium.erous pericardium. the inner, serous portion of pericardium, consisting of two layers, visceral and parietal; the space between the layers is the pericardial cavity. visceral pericardium. the inner layer of the serous pericardium, which is intimately attached to the heart and roots of the great vessels.\n[19] serous pericardium. the inner, serous portion of pericardium, consisting of two layers, visceral and parietal; the space between the layers is the pericardial cavity. visceral pericardium. the inner layer of the serous pericardium, which is intimately attached to the heart and roots of the great vessels.Called also epicardium.erous pericardium. the inner, serous portion of pericardium, consisting of two layers, visceral and parietal; the space between the layers is the pericardial cavity. visceral pericardium. the inner layer of the serous pericardium, which is intimately attached to the heart and roots of the great vessels.\n[20] Sexual activity. Sexual activity requires coordinated motor activity of parasympathetic, sympathetic and somatic motor pathways. In males, erection is maintained mostly by parasympathetic activity, whilst ejaculation is controlled mostly by sympathetic activity.oth somatic and visceral afferents result in complex, brain mediated, responses that include somatic and visceral function. Autonomic motor activity can be generated by both somatic and visceral inputs to the CNS, and visceral inputs to the CNS initiate responses that are both somatic and autonomic.\nSearch Query: define visceral?.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

If you lead a sedentary life you risk building up large amounts of visceral fat in your body. WHAT IS VISCERAL FAT? Visceral fat surrounds your vital organs, the fat is located in the abdominal cavity (stomach area). According to researchers from Duke University Medical Center, exercise can significantly reduce the amount of visceral fat you carry around. The more exercise you do, the more of this type of dangerous fat you will lose. Researchers in this study said that extra exercise can reverse the amount you have, while some moderate exercise can stop your visceral fat mounting up.\n[2] 4.

The visceral or pulmonary pleura covers the outside of the lungs, and the parietal or costal pleura lines the inside of the chest wall, and it extends over the top of diaphragm.\n[11] Definition of visceral. 1 1 : felt in or as if in the internal organs of the body : deep a visceral conviction. 2 2 : not intellectual : instinctive, unreasoning visceral drives. 3 3 : dealing with crude or elemental emotions : earthy a visceral novel. 4 : of, relating to, or located on or among the viscera : splanchnic visceral organs.\n[12] Definition of Visceral. Visceral: Referring to the viscera, the internal organs of the body, specifically those within the chest (as the heart or lungs) or abdomen (as the liver, pancreas or intestines). In a figurative sense, something visceral is felt deep down.. It is a gut feeling..\n[13] Definition of 'visceral'. visceral (v\u00c9\u00aas\u00c9\u0099r\u00c9\u0099l ) Visceral feelings are feelings that you feel very deeply and find it difficult to control or ignore, and that are not the result of thought. I never overcame a visceral antipathy for the monarchy. ...the sheer visceral joy of being alive.\n[14] The suggested ICD-11 chronic pain classification suggests 7 categories for chronic pain. Chronic primary pain: defined by 3 months of persistent pain in one or more anatomical regions that is unexplainable by another pain condition. Chronic cancer pain: defined as cancer or treatment related visceral, musculoskeletal, or bony pain.\n[15] Background. Pneumothorax is defined as the presence of air or gas in the pleural cavity (ie, the potential space between the visceral and parietal pleura of the lung). The clinical results are dependent on the degree of collapse of the lung on the affected side. Pneumothorax can impair oxygenation and/or ventilation.\n[16] Pneumothorax is defined as the presence of air or gas in the pleural cavity (ie, the potential space between the visceral and parietal pleura of the lung), which can impair oxygenation and/or ventilation.

Solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN) is defined as a relatively well defined round or oval pulmonary parenchymal lesion equal or smaller than 30 mm in diameter. It is surrounded by pulmonary parenchyma and/or visceral pleura and is not associated with lymphadenopathy, atelectasis, or pneumonia 9.\n[19] The splanchnic nerves are paired visceral nerves (nerves that contribute to the innervation of the internal organs), carrying fibers of the autonomic nervous system (visceral efferent fibers) as well as sensory fibers from the organs (visceral afferent fibers).he splanchnic nerves are paired visceral nerves (nerves that contribute to the innervation of the internal organs), carrying fibers of the autonomic nervous system (visceral efferent fibers) as well as sensory fibers from the organs (visceral afferent fibers).\n[20] visceral pertaining to the viscera or internal organs. Hence visceral afferents the components of the peripheral nervous system that carry information from the organs. The outgoing nerves to the viscera are the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves of the autonomic nervous system but are not usually known as visceral efferents. visceral pertaining to a viscus.\nSearch Query: define visceral?.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.
