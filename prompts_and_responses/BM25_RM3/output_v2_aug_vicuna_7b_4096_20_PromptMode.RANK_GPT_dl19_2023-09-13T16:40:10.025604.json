They refer to re-usable, long lasting, medical equipment for use in the home that helps individuals to function on a daily basis.\n[12] (December 2012). The standard definition of Durable Medical Equipment used by insurance companies is:Durable Medical Equipment (DME) is any equipment that provides therapeutic benefits to a patient in need because of certain medical conditions and/or illnesses.Durable Medical Equipment (DME) consists of items which:1 are primarily and customarily used to serve a medical purpose; 2 are not useful to a person in the absence of illness or injury; 3 are ordered or prescribed by a physician; 4 are reusable; 5 can stand repeated use, and. 6 are appropriate for use in the home.urable Medical Equipment (DME) consists of items which: 1 are primarily and customarily used to serve a medical purpose; 2 are not useful to a person in the absence of illness or injury; 3 are ordered or prescribed by a physician;\n[13] What is Durable Medical Equipment? Durable medical equipment (DME) and disposable medical supplies are a Colorado Medicaid benefit that provides clients with medical equipment and/or disposable supplies when there is a medical need for the treatment or therapy of an illness or physical condition. DME must serve a medical purpose and be able to withstand repeated use. Some examples of equipment that are considered DME include: oxygen, wheelchairs, walkers and bathroom/bedroom safety equipment. Supplies must also serve a medical purpose, but they are not intended for repeated use. Supply items are items used in active treatment or therapy that are disposable or can be consumed.\n[14] Durable medical equipment (DME) coverage. Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance) covers medically necessary durable medical equipment (DME) that your doctor prescribes for use in your home. Only your doctor can prescribe medical equipment for you. DME meets these criteria: 1 Durable (long-lasting) Used for a medical reason.\n[15] Durable medical equipment (DME) coverage.

Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: what is wifi vs bluetooth.\n\n[1] Bluetooth vs. WiFi - Range: Maximum range for Bluetooth based wireless connections is 30m while for Wi-Fi, it can extend well upto 100m. In Wi-Fi, range depends on the version of Wi-Fi protocol applied and addition of antennas in the communication system while no such concerns of range or extra antenna are much known in Bluetooth. . Bluetooth vs. WiFi - Devices Connected: In Bluetooth, upto 7 devices can be connected to each other (piconet) while in Wi-Fi, the maximum connections depend on Wi-Fi router which can accommodate 1 to several communicating devices at a time.\n[2] Related: wifi repeater wifi router wifi long range antenna wifi range extender wireless router bluetooth transmitter wifi extender outdoor wifi antenna wifi antenna.\n[3] The choice of Bluetooth or WiFi is clear. Bluetooth is a universal standard and easy to use. But, its range is quite limited and sound quality is restricted. WiFi systems have a wider range and can offer excellent fidelity. But, different systems that use WiFi are incompatible, and setup may be difficult.\n[4] Also like WiFi, Bluetooth is \"fairly\" secure. Unlike WiFi, tethering via Bluetooth isn't all that common. Sure, people do it, but it's a little more involved to set up than WiFi, and a little more involved every time you want to use Bluetooth tethering. If power consumption is a concern, Bluetooth is probably the way to go, if you're willing to configure it.\n[5] New Arrival.

A WiFi dongle provides WiFi functionality to a computer that doesn't have ia built-in. Information on how to create a dongle emulator is typically passed from hacker to hacker.\n[7] 1 A lower priced dongle such as the Bluetooth USB 2.0 Dongle retails for $3 to $20 on Amazon. 2 When used as a WiFi dongle, this hardware provides WiFi connectivity to a computer that does not have a built-in Wi-Fi modem. 3 These type of dongles can cost anywhere from $3 to as much as $30. One of the common uses of dongles is used to give a computer bluetooth capabilities by plugging it into a USB port. 2 These types of dongles can cost anywhere from $4 to as much as $65 for a higher-end model.\n[8] 1 A lower priced dongle such as the Bluetooth USB 2.0 Dongle retails for $3 to $20 on Amazon. 2 When used as a WiFi dongle, this hardware provides WiFi connectivity to a computer that does not have a built-in Wi-Fi modem. 3 These type of dongles can cost anywhere from $3 to as much as $30.\n[9] Sky WiFi Smartpen. The Sky WiFi Smartpen is a middle-tier device from Livescribe. Like the Livescribe 3, it can sync your notes wirelessly to an iPhone or iPad in real time. But unlike the more premium pen, which syncs to your mobile device via Bluetooth, the Sky WiFi must be connected to a local Wi-Fi network to sync.\n[10] WiFi has a greater range than Bluetooth \u2013 perhaps as much as 120 feet indoors, but the actual range may be less. With some planning, WiFi can cover an entire house. One way to assure maximum coverage is to locate the WiFi router in the center of a house, or where its coverage is most useful.\n[11] Bluetooth Enabled - Tablets.

Prices have come down a lot, but because it's not as standard as Bluetooth, so it costs more. 2 Setup - Setup can be a huge hassle with wifi systems, especially with cheaper systems. Although most nicer systems utilize an app and WPS to connect to your wifi.\n[16] Support Fastest way to drain the battery. Discussion in 'Android Devices' started by blindnoir, Apr 6, 2010. I want to drain my battery to the very end and then recharge it so I was wondering what to do to really waste the battery really fast. I have the display on the brightest setting, bluetooth and WiFi on. What apps really drain the battery? I tried Sprint TV but it kicked me off the WiFi.\n[17] I use a separate usb wifi adapter. I heard that bluetooth and wifi work the same way. Just want to know if it will apply to this or not. WiFi LAN communication protocol is completely different and is used when high speeds are required and communication distances are much further.\n[18] Bluetooth is an excellent method for tethering. Similar to Wifi, you can connect multiple devices to your smartphone wirelessly. Just like with WiFi, since no cable is required, power consumption is something to keep in mind.\n[19] Sonos speaker vs other bluetooth speakers. Hope everything fine. I'm writing to you to ask for a quick feedback regarding these set of speakers I would like to buy. Sonos Airplay 3: price is about 300 eur. I listened them and I was well impressed about sounds quality. Of course I know it is a plus the possibility to compose with the other speakers but as a negative point, for what i've understood you would need always to be connected to the internet to use the wifi connection.\n[20] 1) Disable Bluetooth in BIOS, keep wifi and Run WiFi latest drivers from Dell. 2) Disable Wifi enable BT and Run Broadcomm Upgrade with alternate network. 3) Enable both in Bios, install Latest Windows 8 BT adapter software from DELL. 4) Run Broadcomm Upgrade Tool one more time.\nSearch Query: what is wifi vs bluetooth.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Hydrogen condenses into a liquid or freezes solid at extremely cold temperatures. Hydrogen's state of matter can change when the temperature changes, becoming a liquid at temperatures between minus 423.18 and minus 434.49 degrees Fahrenheit. It becomes a solid at temperatures below minus 434.49 F.Due to its high flammability, hydrogen gas is commonly used in combustion reactions, such as in rocket and automobile fuels.\n[2] What is neon's state of matter? Full Answer Hydrogen's state of matter can change when the temperature changes, becoming a liquid at temperatures between minus 423.18 and minus 434.49 degrees Fahrenheit. It becomes a solid at temperatures below minus 434.49 F. Due to its high flammability, hydrogen gas is commonly used in combustion reactions, such as in rocket and automobile fuels.\n[3] What is the temperature of the gas turn to liquid? Every gas has a different liquidation temperature based on what element it is. Hydrogen has a liquidation point of 423.17 degrees below zero F.\n[4] User: Hydrogen is a liquid below what temperature? a. 100 degrees C c. -183 degrees C b. -253 degrees C d. 0 degrees C Weegy: Hydrogen is a liquid below 253 degrees C.

At room temperature and under standard pressure conditions, hydrogen is a gas that is tasteless, odorless and colorless. Hydrogen can exist as a liquid under high pressure and an extremely low temperature of 20.28 kelvin (\u2212252.87\u00b0C, \u2212423.17 \u00b0F). Hydrogen is often stored in this way as liquid hydrogen takes up less space than hydrogen in its normal gas form. Liquid hydrogen is also used as a rocket fuel.\n[6] Buy Compressed Hydrogen Gas or Liquid Hydrogen (H2) Buy Compressed Hydrogen Gas or Liquid Hydrogen (H2) We offer compressed hydrogen gas and liquid hydrogen (H2) in a variety of purities and concentrations.

You can make water boil, however, by putting it in a vacuum! Boiling is the process of a substance changing from liquid to gas phase.or Hydrogen, the boiling point is -253 degrees Celsius; for Mercury it is 357 degrees Celsius, and for Iron it is 2,750 degrees Celsius. From these numbers you can see that at room temperature (and indeed for nearly any temperature found on Earth) Hydrogen is a gas, Mercury is a liquid, and Iron is a solid.\n[8] Gas to Liquid: Water change from a gas (water vapor) to a liquid through the process of condensation. The gas cools and loses energy which forces the particles-hydrogen and oxygen in the case of water-to change state from a gas to a liquid.Liquid to Solid: When water as a liquid turns to water as a solid (ice) it goes through the process of freezing. The liquid cools below the freezing point and loses energy.ydrogen and oxygen are elements. What that really means is that when an atom, the fundamental unit that makes up everything, has 1 proton (a positively charged sub-atomic particle) it is a hydrogen atom, and when it has 8 protons, it is an oxygen atom. Hydrogen gas is two hydrogen atoms bonded together, H 2.\n[9] Hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless gas. Its density is the lowest of any chemical element, 0.08999 grams per liter. By comparison, a liter of air weighs 1.29 grams, 14 times as much as a liter of hydrogen. Hydrogen changes from a gas to a liquid at a temperature of -252.77\u00b0C (-422.99\u00b0F) and from a liquid to a solid at a temperature of -259.2\u00b0C (-434.6\u00b0F). It is slightly soluble in water, alcohol, and a few other common liquids.\n[10] The hydrogen gas that makes up most of the atmosphere slowly changes to liquid with depth as the pressure increases. Below the liquid hydrogen rests the heavier liquid helium. Deep in the depths of the body of Saturn, the hydrogen is then under tremendous pressure, and is transformed to liquid metallic hydrogen.\n[11] Atmosphere. The composition of Jupiter's atmosphere is similar to that of the sun\u2014mostly hydrogen and helium. Deep in the atmosphere, the pressure and temperature increase, compressing the hydrogen gas into a liquid.

Ice melts due to the chemical properties of water. There are more hydrogen bonds between the molecules of ice than in water. Ice begins to melt when its temperature exceeds 0 degrees Celsius and hydrogen bonds between water molecules break.\n[20] A further temperature decrease below the boiling point eventually results in mixtures of liquid and solid hydrogen or slush hydrogen, SLH 2. Slush offers the advantages of a higher density and a prolongation of the storage time of the cryogen as the solid melts and absorbs heat.

A typical volume of air at sea level at 15 degrees Celsius contains approximately 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen and between 1 and 5 percent water vapor.\n[7] This is a false assumption. What is correct, however, is that at certain moments in anyone's life, such as when we are simply at rest and thinking, we may be using only 10 percent of our brains.It turns out though, that we use virtually every part of the brain, and that [most of] the brain is active almost all the time, Gordon adds.Let's put it this way: the brain represents three percent of the body's weight and uses 20 percent of the body's energy..his is a false assumption. What is correct, however, is that at certain moments in anyone's life, such as when we are simply at rest and thinking, we may be using only 10 percent of our brains.\n[8] But this still doesn't answer the question. So how do you know if you are a Three Percenter? Try to understand that being a Three Percenter (Threeper, 3%, 3 Percenter, etc) is more of an idea than anything else, but there are some clues that will help you figure it out. What follows is NOT all encompassing or even an extensive listing of clues. Instead, these are merely just a few of the many indicators.\n[9] Of all couples trying to conceive: 30 percent get pregnant within the first cycle (about one month). 60 percent get pregnant within three cycles (about three months). 80 percent get pregnant within six cycles (about six months). 85 percent get pregnant within 12 cycles (about one year). 91 percent get pregnant within 36 cycles (about three years). 93 to 95 percent get pregnant within 48 cycles (about four years).\n[10] The annualized turnover rate for all dealership positions is 39.4 percent. That figures is a 3 percent increase year-over-year. One-year retention for all positions hit 71 percent and three-year retention came in a 47 percent. Sales consultant annualized turnover is 71.9 percent, which is a YOY increase of 5.6 percent. The sales role also had a one-year retention rate of 60 percent and three-year retention rate of 32.8 percent.\n[11] The short answer: No. Here are three reasons why. The 30 percent rule has roots in 1969 public housing regulations, which capped public housing rent at 25 percent of a tenant's income (it inched up to 30 percent in the early 1980s). Rather than looking at what consumers should be spending on housing, however, the government selected the percentages because that's what consumers were spending.\n[12] Of all couples trying to conceive: 1 30 percent get pregnant within the first cycle (about one month). 2 60 percent get pregnant within three cycles (about three months). 3 80 percent get pregnant within six cycles (about six months). 4 85 percent get pregnant within 12 cycles (about one year). 5 91 percent get pregnant within 36 cycles (about three years).\n[13] Of all couples trying to conceive: 1 30 percent get pregnant within the first cycle (about one month). 2 59 percent get pregnant within three cycles (about three months). 3 80 percent get pregnant within six cycles (about six months). 80 percent get pregnant within six cycles (about six months). 2 85 percent get pregnant within 12 cycles (about one year). 3 91 percent get pregnant within 36 cycles (about three years). 4 93 to 95 percent get pregnant within 48 cycles (about four years).\n[14] Store discount: All Team Members receive a 20 percent discount and are eligible to receive an additional 10 percent (up to 30 percent) through the company's voluntary \"Healthy Discount Incentive Program.\" The average for the retail industry is 10 percent.ur Team Members actually have a say in the benefits we offer\u2014we hold a companywide vote every three years.

Acute pelvic pain is pain that starts over a short period of time anywhere from a few minutes to a few days. This type of pain is often a warning sign that something is wrong and should be evaluated promptly. Pelvic pain can be caused by an infection or inflammation. An infection doesn't have to affect the reproductive organs to cause pelvic pain. Pain caused by the bladder, bowel, or appendix can produce pain in the pelvic region; diverticulitis, irritable bowel syndrome, kidney or bladder stones, as well as muscle spasms or strains are some examples of non-reproductive causes of pelvic or lower abdominal pain.\n[11] 1 Young, sexually active women with multiple sex partners are at greatest risk for pelvic inflammatory disease. 2 Pelvic inflammatory disease many not produce any symptoms. 3 In other cases it can cause fever, abdominal or pelvic pain, vaginal discharge, painful urination, or painful sexual intercourse. Pelvic inflammatory disease many not produce any symptoms. 2 In other cases it can cause fever, abdominal or pelvic pain, vaginal discharge, painful urination, or painful sexual intercourse.\n[12] Causes of Right Hip Pain. Due to the close proximity of organs in the abdominal and pelvic cavity, it is not always possible to isolate a specific organ when pain occurs at a particular region. Therefore the most common conditions of the nearest organs to this area needs to be considered. Pain may arise from the hip joint itself or the pelvic bone but there are also other possible conditions as discussed below. Abdominal wall pain is one of the common but often neglected causes of right hip pain. The pain may arise with trauma to the abdominal wall or with muscle strain. The pain is typically superficial and aggravated with movement or touch.\n[13] Chronic pelvic pain is pain in the area below your bellybutton and between your hips that lasts six months or longer. Chronic pelvic pain can have multiple causes. It can be a symptom of another disease, or it can be a condition in its own right. If your chronic pelvic pain appears to be caused by another medical problem, treating that problem may be enough to eliminate your pain.\n[14] Causes. Usually, pelvic pain is not caused by a serious disorder. It is often related to the menstrual cycle. However, several disorders that cause pelvic pain can lead to peritonitis (inflammation and usually infection of the abdominal cavity), which is a serious disorder.sually, pelvic pain is not caused by a serious disorder. It is often related to the menstrual cycle. However, several disorders that cause pelvic pain can lead to peritonitis (inflammation and usually infection of the abdominal cavity), which is a serious disorder.\n[15] Although pelvic pain often refers to pain in the region of women's internal reproductive organs, pelvic pain can be present in men, too, and can stem from multiple causes. Pelvic pain may be a symptom of infection or may arise from pain in the pelvic bone or in non-reproductive internal organs, such as the bladder or colon. In women, however, pelvic pain can very well be an indication that there may be a problem with one of the reproductive organs in the pelvic area (uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix, or vagina). What Causes Pelvic Pain? Possible causes of pelvic pain in both men and women may include: Appendicitis; Bladder disorders; Sexually transmitted diseases\n[16] Pelvic Pain: What's Causing Your Pelvic Pain?

Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: how are some sharks warm blooded.\n\n[1] Most sharks are cold-blooded. Some, like the Mako and the Great white shark, are partially warmblooded (they are endotherms). Cold blooded although if you've ever seen a Great White Shark hunt sea lions you'd be thinking they would have to be hotblooded.

Whales are long lived mammals with a lifespan of 70 \u2013 100 years. Differences between Shark and Whale. \u2022 Sharks are fish and cold-blooded, whereas whales are warm-blooded mammals.\n[3] Are sharks cold-blooded or warm-blooded? Sharks have a reputation as \"cold-blooded killers\" and despite how negative that term is, it's not entirely inaccurate. Sharks are by no means evil, vicious killers like that quote suggests. Nonetheless, sharks are, for the most part anyways, efficient ectothermic predators. Endo vs Ecto.\n[4] Are White Sharks warm-blooded or cold-blooded? White sharks are part of the fish family, so they must be 'cold-blooded', right? Actually, white sharks are much more complex than you may think. An animal that is 'cold-blooded' means their inside body temperature is dependent on the environment they are in. For example, a snake is cold blooded, so its body temperature fluctuates with the day or even whether or not they are in the sun.\n[5] These sharks can raise their temperature about th\u2026e temperature of the water; they need to have occasional short bursts of speed in hunting Cold blooded although if you've ever seen a Great White Shark hunt sea lions you'd be thinking they would have to be hotblooded. Actually the Salmon Shark is a warm blooded shark.\n[6] Regardless sharks are cold blooded, they live either in warm, temperate and cold waters. Some species live mainly in cold waters, while some others prefer warmer waters. SHARK MIGRATION. One thing is for sure; sharks migrate to find new sources of food and they can travel up to hundreds of miles to do that. Most species of sharks live in the oceans. However, some of them are known to dwell in bodies of freshwater, like the bull shark which travels up to 4,000 Km up the Amazon River. Sometimes, sharks reach freshwater bodies; this could be the result of the destruction of their habitat by human activities.\n[7] Sharks' blood gives them turbo speed. Several species of shark and tuna have something special going on inside their bodies. For a long time, scientists have known that some fish species appear warm-blooded. Salmon sharks can elevate their body temperatures by up to 20 degrees compared to the surrounding water, for example.\n[8] Great white sharks are some of the only warm blooded sharks. This allows them to swim in colder waters in addition to warm, tropical waters. Great White sharks can be found as\u2026 north as Alaska and as south as the southern tip of South America. They exist worldwide, everywhere in-between. 5 people found this useful.\n[9] Some fish are ectothermic such as the Blue shark whereas others are endothermic such as swordfish and Lamnid sharks.ndothermic = warm-blooded Ectothermic = cold-blooded Endotherms are able to maintain their own body temperature, whereas Ectotherms rely on their environment to regulate body \u2026 temperature.\n[10] For many people, sharks are the epitome of the 'cold-blooded killer'. The warm-bodied mackerel sharks are spectacular reminders that many of our stereotypes are inaccurate. As apex predators, sharks are absolutely essential to the health and vigor of marine ecosystems.\n[11] Most sharks are cold-blooded. Some, like the Mako and the Great white shark, are partially warmblooded (they are endotherms). These sharks can raise their temperature about the temperature of the water; they need to have occasional short bursts of speed in hunting.\n[12] More on Warm-Bodied Sharks. Shortfin Mako (Isurus oxyrinchus) A question came across SHARK-L concerning makos being considered warm-blooded and various replies touch upon aspects of the topic. I responded to the original query and went onto expand upon or correct some of those responses.\n[13] White sharks are part of the fish family, so they must be 'cold-blooded', right? Actually, white sharks are much more complex than you may think. An animal that is 'cold-blooded' means their inside body temperature is dependent on the environment they are in. For example, a snake is cold blooded, so its body temperature fluctuates with the day or even whether or not they are in the sun.\n[14] How far can sharks smell blood? A: A great white shark can smell blood in a radius of approximately 1/3 mile or as low as 1 part per 25 million.. Not all sharks have this strong of a sense of smell; however, all sharks do have a sense of smell that is superior to many animals. Continue Reading.\n[15] In some sharks, these sensitive cells can detect even the slightest traces of blood in the water. A great white shark, for example, would be able to detect a single drop of blood in an Olympic-size pool. Most sharks can detect blood and animal odors from many miles away.\n[16] And I think blue sharks are more aggresive than whale sharks. _ The blue whale is the largest mammal on Earth. The underside of its flippers are almost white, while the rest of its body is blue grey. The average blue whale is 75 to 80 feet long and weigh up to 110 tonnes.Females are larger and can weigh up to 150 tonnes.he Whale Shark, like the Blue Whale, are both filter feeders. Blue Whales (Balaenoptera musculus), on the other hand are class mammalia--- they're mammals, as we are. They are warm blooded, have hair, bear and nurse their young alive. As with all Mysticetes (the sub class), they are filter feeders.\n[17] Answer: The fastest shark is a Mako Shark, the shark can reach a speed of 45 mph. The Great White Shark attack with a speed of about 30 mph. Answer: It is said that sharks can scent 1 single drop of blood in a 6 miles distance, but I have never heard about documented proofs telling so.nswer: The fastest shark is a Mako Shark, the shark can reach a speed of 45 mph.

It depends on the type of shark, most sharks like living in warm or tropical waters,such as Hawaii and Australia.Some sharks though can live in colder waters,such as the Greenland shark and the Great White shark.The Great White Shark has even been seen in the cold waters of Sanfransisco.\n[19] But the advantages of endothermy are costly. To maintain a warm body in cold water, a mackerel shark must burn fuel like a blast furnace. A warm-bodied shark may need more than ten times as much food as a cold-bodied shark of the same size.\n[20] What eats a shark? What do sharks eat? There are many species of sharks, from tiny, two-foot (.75 meter) sand sharks to great white sharks that can reach a length of 20 feet (6.5 meters) or more. Most sharks eat fish, octopi, squid, turtles, and other cold-blooded sea creatures, along with the occasional sea bird caught napping on the water.\nSearch Query: how are some sharks warm blooded.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

USER: I will provide you with 20 passages, each indicated by a numerical identifier []. Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: how to find the midsegment of a trapezoid.\n\n[1] Extended Conjecture: (Trapezoid Midsegment Conjecture): The midsegment of a trapezoid is parallel to the bases and is equal in length to the average of the lengths of the two bases. Explanation: A midsegment of a trapezoid is a segment that connects the midpoints of the two non-parallel sides of a trapezoid. This segment has two special properties. It is parallel to the bases of the trapezoid. The length of the midsegment is the average of the lengths of the two bases. Remember that the bases of a trapezoid are parallel. Key Curriculum Press can provide demo versions of Geometer's Sketch Pad.\n[2] The midsegment of a trapezoid is the segment that joins the midpoints of the nonparallel sides of a trapezoid. In the trapezoid below, the midpoints of the non-parallel sides are points S and V. The midsegment is the red line segment from S to V. The midsegment below can be found by. 1 calculating the lengths of the bases. 2 35-16 = 9 (length of upper base). 3 45-0 =45 (length of lower base). 4 calculating the sum of the bases.\n[3] The midsegment of a trapezoid is the segment that joins the midpoints of the nonparallel sides of a trapezoid. In the trapezoid below, the midpoints of the non-parallel sides are points S and V. The midsegment is the red line segment from S to V. The midsegment below can be found by. 1 calculating the lengths of the bases. 2 35-16 = 9 (length of upper base). 3 45-0 =45 (length of lower base). 4 calculating the sum of the bases. 5 9+45 = 54.\n[4] The midpoint of the red segment pictured on the left is the point (A, 2b). The most important thing to remember is that a midpoint bisects a line (cuts a line into two equal halves). The midsegment of a trapezoid is the segment that joins the midpoints of the nonparallel sides of a trapezoid. In the trapezoid below, the midpoints of the non-parallel sides are points S and V. The midsegment is the red line segment from S to V. The midsegment below can be found by. calculating the lengths of the bases 35-16 = 9 (length of upper base) 45-0 =45 (length of lower base) calculating the sum of the bases 9+45 = 54.\n[5] A trapezoid midsegment connects the midpoints of the two congruent sides of the trapezoid, and is parallel to the pair of parallel sides. The length of the midsegment is the sum of the two bases divided by 2. Remember that the bases of a trapezoid are the two parallel sides. To find angles within a trapezoid, remember that since there are two sides are parallel, the other sides can be seen as transversals, forming corresponding angles and same side interior angles.\n[6] The midsegment of a trapezoid has two special properties: 1 The midsegment of a trapezoid is parallel to each base. 2 The length of the midsegment of a trapezoid is equal to half the sum of the lengths of its bases.\n[7] The midsegment of a trapezoid is referred to as the median or the midline. The length of the midsegment is calculated by finding the average length of each of the parallel sides. The formula for this length is the sum of the length of side A plus the length of side B, divided by two. The midsegment is also used to calculate the area of a trapezoid. Learn more about Shapes.\n[8] The midsegment (also called the median or midline) of a trapezoid is the segment that joins the midpoints of the legs. It is parallel to the bases. Its length m is equal to the average of the lengths of the bases a and b of the trapezoid, The midsegment of a trapezoid is one of the two bimedians (the other bimedian divides the trapezoid into equal areas). The height (or altitude) is the perpendicular distance between the bases.\n[9] The side of the triangle that the midsegment does not intersect is the base of the triangle. The midsegment of a trapezoid is the segment formed by connecting the midpoints of the two legs of a trapezoid. Although the midsegment of a trapezoid is also useful in mathematics, we will not discuss it here.\n[10] This segment's length is always equal to one-half the sum of the trapezoid's bases, or. Consider trapezoid ABCD shown below. The midsegment, EF, which is shown in red, has a length of. The measurement of the midsegment is only dependent on the length of the trapezoid's bases.\n[11] In the trapezoid below, the midpoints of the non-parallel sides are points S and V. The midsegment is the red line segment from S to V. The midsegment below can be found by. calculating the lengths of the bases 35-16 = 9 (length of upper base) 45-0 =45 (length of lower base) calculating the sum of the bases 9+45 = 54.\n[12] In the trapezoid below, the midpoints of the non-parallel sides are points S and V. The midsegment is the red line segment from S to V. The midsegment below can be found by. 1 calculating the lengths of the bases. 35-16 = 9 (length of upper base)\n[13] The top and bottom sides of the trapezoid run parallel to each other, so they are the trapezoid's bases. The other sides of the trapezoid will intersect if extended, so they are the trapezoid's legs. The segment that connects the midpoints of the legs of a trapezoid is called the midsegment.\n[14] The opposite sides of a trapezoid that are parallel to each other are called bases. The remaining sides of the trapezoid, which intersect at some point if extended, are called the legs of the trapezoid. The top and bottom sides of the trapezoid run parallel to each other, so they are the trapezoid's bases. The other sides of the trapezoid will intersect if extended, so they are the trapezoid's legs. The segment that connects the midpoints of the legs of a trapezoid is called the midsegment.\n[15] The midsegment (also called the median or midline) of a trapezoid is the segment that joins the midpoints of the legs. It is parallel to the bases. Its length m is equal to the average of the lengths of the bases a and b of the trapezoid,\n[16] The segment that connects the midpoints of the legs of a trapezoid is called the midsegment. This segment's length is always equal to one-half the sum of the trapezoid's bases, or. Consider trapezoid ABCD shown below.\n[17] The midsegment (also called the median or midline) of a trapezoid is the segment that joins the midpoints of the legs. It is parallel to the bases. Its length m is equal to the average of the lengths of the bases a and b of the trapezoid,n obtuse trapezoid with two pairs of parallel sides is a parallelogram. A parallelogram has central 2-fold rotational symmetry (or point reflection symmetry). There is some disagreement whether parallelograms, which have two pairs of parallel sides, should be regarded as trapezoids.\n[18] Median of a Trapezoid The median (also called a midline or midsegment) is a line segment half-way between the two bases. The median's length is the average of the two base lengths: m = a+b2\n[19] In a regular n-gon, the sum of the measures of the exterior angles is ___. The sum of the measures of the exterior angles of a 39-gon is ___. If the midsegment of a trapezoid has length 8 m, and one of the bases has length 6 cm, then the other base has length ___cm.\n[20] According to this theorem mid segment of a trapezoid is equal to half of sum of its two parallel sides. In triangle ABC M is mid point of AB and P is midpoint of AC. so MP is mid segment of triangle ABC. similarly just apply this rule in triangle ACD the PN is midsegment of triangle ACD.\nSearch Query: how to find the midsegment of a trapezoid.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: difference between a mcdouble and a double cheeseburger.\n\n[1] There is a discernible difference between the two burgers, especially in the meat quality. The McDouble contains gristle and carry's a different flavor than the Double Cheeseburger. The double cheeseburger tastes more like beef. The McDouble tastes of whatever meat filler they use to fill the gap.\n[2] At first glance, the double cheeseburger looks a lot like the McDouble, but it is not exactly the same thing. The main difference that you will notice is the amount of cheese that is on this sandwich. There are two slices of cheese on the double cheeseburger instead of just the one slice of cheese that comes on the McDouble. Even though it comes with two slices of cheese, it still has the onions, pickles, ketchup and mustard that come on the other burgers.\n[3] But I did it for you. With McDonald's recent release of the McDouble, they now have three basic, sub-$2 cheeseburgers: the cheeseburger, McDouble (two patties with one slice of cheese), and double cheeseburger (two patties with two slices of cheese).\n[4] Although we previously reported that the McDouble would be on the Dollar Menu, in Manhattan the cheeseburger appears on the Dollar Menu while the McDouble is $1.39 and the double cheeseburger is $1.49.\n[5] The Double Cheesburger is now $1.19 instead of a buck. Seriously, $.19/slice of cheese and a removal from the Dollar Menu. Do I order the Double Cheeseburger at its new full price or do I stick to the Dollar Menu and go with the McDouble. Of course, I go with the McDouble. One piece of McCheese might be better than two pieces of McCheese. I guess McDonalds thinks people like me who bought the Double Cheeseburger for a buck will pony up and pay the extra pennies. Sooner or later they will be charging for extra napkins and ketchup.\n[6] Review: Triple Cheeseburger from McDonald's. When it comes to the various sizes of classic McDonald's cheeseburgers, the prices might have you scratching your head. The price differences between a McDonald's Cheeseburger, the beefier McDouble and the cheesier Double Cheeseburger now all fall within 50-cents of one another.\n[7] The Double Cheeseburger is priced at $1.49 and my Triple Cheeseburger was priced at $2.19. I just don't understand the point of paying 70-cents for an extra burger patty when you can just get two McDoubles for $2.00. Obviously the value of the Triple Cheeseburger makes no sense when you're comparing menu items.\n[8] The McDouble is listed as a slice of American cheese between two 100% beef patties, topped with pickles, onions, ketchup and mustard. mcdonalds.com. The Double Cheeseburger is listed as two slices of golden American cheese with two 100% all beef patties, pickles, onions, ketchup and mustard.\n[9] There are many items that can be purchased at McDonald's for just $1, really, just check their dollar menu ! Here's a tip that not everyone knows... a McDouble from the McDonalds Dollar menu is the same thing as a Double Cheeseburger-well, minus one piece of cheese (and a lot of cents).\n[10] The difference is that the Mighty Kid's Meal provides more food than what is typically found in a Happy Meal, providing a McDouble (a cheeseburger consisting of two patties and one slice of cheese) instead of a cheeseburger or a hamburger, and more Chicken McNuggets (6 versus 4), plus a larger drink (16oz vs 12oz).\n[11] So whenever the McDouble hit the Dollar Menu and the Double Cheeseburger was thrown into the \"Burgers\" section at $1.19 or even higher ($1.29 in most places now), the average consumer scratched their head, winced their eyes, and fell over in a wrath of confusion and bewilderment.\n[12] No, The McDonald's McDouble Is Not The 'Greatest Food In Human History'. McDonald's. 800. I may be a little late to this, but it is never too late to point out how stupid it is to argue that the McDonald's McDouble cheeseburger is the greatest food in human history..\n[13] POINTS\u00ae CALORIES TOTAL FAT TOTAL FIBER; White Castle: 3: 140: 7: 0: Cheeseburger: 4: 170: 9: 0: Jalapeno Cheeseburger: 4: 180: 10: 0: Bacon Cheeseburger: 5: 200: 11: 0: Double White Castle: 6: 250: 13: 1: Double Cheeseburger: 7: 300: 17: 1: Double Jalapeno Cheeseburger: 8: 320: 19: 1: Double Bacon Cheeseburger: 9: 370: 22: 1: Chicken Ring Sandwich w/Cheese on Golden Bun: 5: 200: 10: 0: Chicken Breast Sandwich w/Cheese on Golden Bun: 4: 200: 7: 1\n[14] BURGER KING\u00ae Bacon Cheeseburger Deluxe, Bacon Double Cheeseburger, Bacon Cheeseburger, Double Cheeseburger VALUE Menu\n[15] Cheeseburgers.

The difference with ASN and BSN is ASN is a 2 year degree and BSN is a 4 year degree. You will get paid more with a BSN. And I think hospitals are looking more for BSN students.If I were 18, I would go straight thru the 4 years.ut, you're still an RN either way. The best jobs will require the master's degree and have titles like Family Nurse Practitioner or Nurse Anesthetist with salaries nearing $100K per year. They are still an RN-they just have more training than most RNs.\n[8] What Is the Difference Between RN and BSN Degrees? A registered nurse (RN) is a nurse who has passed the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX-RN) after completing an accredited training program. These programs come in the form of an Associate of Science in Nursing (ASN) or a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN).\n[9] ADN vs. BSN Degree. Trying to decide whether to pursue an Associate Degree in Nursing (ADN) or Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) can be a difficult decision.

Both degrees will qualify you to sit for the NCLEX-RN exam and to apply for licensure as a registered nurse. However, there are significant differences between the two.\n[10] RN stands for registered nurse, the next license after LPN. BSN, bachelor of science nursing, and ADN, associate degree nursing are two of the educational levels that allow one to test for an RN license.Don't mix up the license with the education level required to get the license.SN is a four-year degree, aka Bachelor of Science Nursing. There is little, if any, difference in pay between a registered nurse with his/her ADN vs. BSN. The difference is management opportunity, which is geared toward the BSN.\n[11] The higher level positions have a higher average salary. For that reason, while there is no significant difference in the salary of an ADN RN and a BSN RN working as a staff nurse on a hospital unit, a nurse with a BSN will make more income over the course of their career.Many ADN graduates return to school and complete their BSN after they start working.owever, many facilities also offer a differential for the BSN degree. On a national level an RN with a BSN makes $2500-$3500 more per year in the entry level position due to the differential.\n[12] Difference Between Rn and Bsn. RN vs BSN.

That's the only way to become a registered nurse in the US.\n[17] NursingLink. First of all, let's establish what each one stands for. A BSN is a Bachelor of Science in Nursing, while an ADN is an Associates Degree in Nursing. Both degrees lead to getting your RN but there are some differences between the two.The main difference is the length of time and the amount of credits required to complete the program.ursingLink.

With that said the actual difference between an RN (ADN) and an RN (BSN) might be better measured in the way of professional opportunity and options for upward mobility rather than the actual pay for a position.\n[19] Short version: All BSNs are RNs, but not all RNs are BSNs. RN is registered nurse. You can get there via a diploma program, an associates degree (ADN) program or a bachelors degree (BSN) program. A BSN RN is just an RN with a bachelor's degree--basically, they have the most schooling and it (usually) takes the longest to achieve.\n[20] RN to BSN Overview. You can always spot a Drexel Nurse.

RSA encryption is a public-key encryption technology developed by RSA Data Security. The RSA algorithm is based on the difficulty in factoring very large numbers. Based on this principle, the RSA encryption algorithm uses prime factorization as the trap door for encryption. Deducing an RSA key, therefore, takes a huge amount of time and processing power. RSA is the standard encryption method for important data, especially data that's transmitted over the Internet.\n[2] RSA encryption is based on use of a public and a private key. Typically a key fob (such as an RSA SecurID security token) is used by employees in security-sensitive companies.The token generates a public key that changes every minute.SA encryption is based on use of a public and a private key. Typically a key fob (such as an RSA SecurID security token) is used by employees in security-sensitive companies.\n[3] RSA makes the public key infrastructure (PKI) encryption standards by which much of the Internet's secure communication are run. Other RSA products include hardware token s, software tokens, SecurID, Besafe and enVision. RSA encryption is based on use of a public and a private key. Typically a key fob (such as an RSA SecurID security token) is used by employees in security-sensitive companies. The token generates a public key that changes every minute.\n[4] THE CRYPTOGRAPHY GUIDE: RSA. RSA RSA is a public key algorithm invented by Rivest, Shamir and Adleman. The key used for encryption is different from (but related to) the key used for decryption.The algorithm is based on modular exponentiation.hen talking of key lengths in connection with RSA, what is meant is the modulus length. An algorithm that uses different keys for encryption and decryption is said to be asymmetric. Anybody knowing the public key can use it to create encrypted messages, but only the owner of the secret key can decrypt them.\n[5] The RSA cryptosystem is the most widely-used public key cryptography algorithm in the world. It can be used to encrypt a message without the need to exchange a secret key separately. The RSA algorithm can be used for both public key encryption and digital signatures.Its security is based on the difficulty of factoring large integers. Party A can send an encrypted message to party B without any prior exchange of secret keys.he RSA cryptosystem is the most widely-used public key cryptography algorithm in the world. It can be used to encrypt a message without the need to exchange a secret key separately. The RSA algorithm can be used for both public key encryption and digital signatures.\n[6] Use this command to generate RSA key pairs for your Cisco device (such as a router). RSA keys are generated in pairs--one public RSA key and one private RSA key. If your router already has RSA keys when you issue this command, you will be warned and prompted to replace the existing keys with new keys.\n[7] Use this command to generate RSA key pairs for your Cisco device (such as a router). RSA keys are generated in pairs--one public RSA key and one private RSA key. If your router already has RSA keys when you issue this command, you will be warned and prompted to replace the existing keys with new keys.amed Key Pairs. If you generate a named key pair using the key-label argument, you must also specify the usage-keys keyword or the general-keys keyword. Named key pairs allow you to have multiple RSA key pairs, enabling the Cisco IOS software to maintain a different key pair for each identity certificate.\n[8] What is an RSA key used for? RSA key is a private key based on RSA algorithm. Private Key is used for authentication and a symmetric key exchange during establishment of an SSL/TLS session. It is a part of the public key infrastructure that is generally used in case of SSL certificates.\n[9] RSA Algorithm. The RSA algorithm is named after Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Len Adleman, who invented it in 1977 [ RIVE78 ]. The basic technique was first discovered in 1973 by Clifford Cocks [ COCK73 ] of CESG (part of the British GCHQ) but this was a secret until 1997.The patent taken out by RSA Labs has expired.he RSA cryptosystem is the most widely-used public key cryptography algorithm in the world. It can be used to encrypt a message without the need to exchange a secret key separately. The RSA algorithm can be used for both public key encryption and digital signatures.\n[10] RSA involves a public key and private key. The public key can be known to everyone, it is used to encrypt messages. Messages encrypted using the public key can only be decrypted with the private key. The keys for the RSA algorithm are generated the following way: 1 Choose two different large random prime numbers and.\n[11] RSA encryption is based on use of a public and a private key.

The RSA algorithm is based on the fact that there is no efficient way to factor very large numbers.\n[13] RSA (cryptosystem) For other uses, see RSA (disambiguation). RSA is one of the first practical public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission. In such a cryptosystem, the encryption key is public and differs from the decryption key which is kept secret. In RSA, this asymmetry is based on the practical difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers, the factoring problem.\n[14] The RSA system is the most commonly used encryption and authentication algorithm, and is included as a part of Cisco IOS. To use the RSA system, a network host generates a pair of keys. One is called the public key, and the other is called the private key. The Public key is given to anyone who wants to send encrypted data to the host. The Private key is never shared.\n[15] RSA Security is a United States-based organization that creates encryption, network and computer security products. Ron Rivest Adi Shamir, and Len Adleman founded RSA as an independent company in 1982.SA encryption is based on use of a public and a private key.

PEM encoded RSA private key is a format that stores an RSA private key, for use with cryptographic systems such as SSL. A public key can be derived from the private key, and the public key may be associated with one or more certificate files.\n[18] To encrypt a plaintext m, just apply the RSA function with the public key; to decrypt, apply it with the private key. That's where many textbook descriptions of RSA encryption stop. But it's not the whole story. In practice, using the textbook version of RSA encryption is actually insecure.\n[19] RSA involves a public key and a private key. The public key can be known by everyone and is used for encrypting messages.

In RSA, this asymmetry is based on the practical difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers, the factoring problem.\n[20] Definition - What does Public Key Cryptography (PKC) mean? Public key cryptography (PKC) is an encryption technique that uses a paired public and private key (or asymmetric key) algorithm for secure data communication. A message sender uses a recipient's public key to encrypt a message. To decrypt the sender's message, only the recipient's private key may be used. The two types of PKC algorithms are RSA, which is an acronym related to this algorithm's inventors: Rivest, Shamir and Adelman and Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA).\nSearch Query: rsa definition key.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Mechanical ventilation is a method of forced or induced ventilation by using mechanical air handling systems, commonly called HVAC systems. Mechanical ventilation is more controllable than natural ventilation. In Mechanical Ventilation blowers, fans, filters, and ducts are used for transporting and removing air from a space.There are two types of fans used for the transmission of air. When the air enters the impellers axially and is discharged radially from the impeller, it is called a centrifugal or radial flow fan.t is the movement of air from one space to other as well as supply of fresh air into the air conditioned space.

Often the heating, cooling and ventilation of a building are combined in the air-conditioning system.In a mechanical ventilation system the supply air and the exhaust air are transported mechanically.y controlling the ventilator it is possible to control the ventilation capacity of the system. Natural air supply with mechanical air exhaust. This is a popular form of ventilation in residential buildings and offices.\n[7] Define ventilation. ventilation synonyms, ventilation pronunciation, ventilation translation, English dictionary definition of ventilation. n. 1. a. The replacement of stale or noxious air with fresh air. b. The mechanical system or equipment used to circulate air or to replace stale air with...\n[8] There are other ways to estimate home ventilator prevalence in the United States. Medicare claims data from 2010 indicates approximately 3,172 patients on home mechanical ventilation using an invasive interface, and 899 patients on home mechanical ventilation with a noninvasive interface.n some countries, if the patient requires ventilator support more than X hours per day, he is placed on a life-support ventilator. There seems to be no consensus on the number of hours per day that constitutes \"life-support ventilation.\" Some countries use 12 hours, some 14 hours, some more.\n[9] Mechanical ventilation is a life support treatment. A mechanical. ventilator is a machine that helps people breathe when they are not. able to breathe enough on their own. The mechanical ventilator is. also called a ventilator, respirator, or breathing machine. Most. patients who need support from a ventilator because of a severe. illness are cared for in a hospital's intensive care unit (ICU).\n[10] Mechanical ventilation may be defined as the use of a mechanical device to provide. ventilator support for patients. There are 2 types of mechanical ventilation: positive and. negative pressure ventilation. Positive pressure ventilation delivers a positive pressure to. inflate the lungs. Expiration is passive.\n[11] Knowledge and understanding of mechanical ventilation are central to ensuring patients' safe passage from the acute stage to weaning. The author discusses the science related to mechanical ventilation in patients with ARDS.Mechanical ventilation is one of the most commonly used technologies in critical care.Despite the prevalence of ventilators, care planning is heavily influenced by anecdote and clinical preference.nowledge and understanding of mechanical ventilation are central to ensuring patients' safe passage from the acute stage to weaning. The author discusses the science related to mechanical ventilation in patients with ARDS.\n[12] Mechanical ventilation is also called forced or induced ventilation and is done by fans and other mechanical means. This means of ventilation is very effective in controlling the humidity and air quality inside an air conditioned space.t is the movement of air from one space to other as well as supply of fresh air into the air conditioned space. Mechanical ventilation assists in controlling the humidity, contaminants, air borne particles, and general air quality.\n[13] Mechanical ventilation. For the use in architecture and climate control, see Ventilation (architecture). Mechanical ventilation is the medical term for artificial ventilation where mechanical means is used to assist or replace spontaneous breathing.\n[14] Glossopharyngeal breathing as positive pressure ventilation. Glossopharyngeal breathing is a form of positive pressure ventilation produced by the patient's voluntary muscles where boluses of air are forced into the lungs. Paralyzed patients dependent on a mechanical ventilator may be able to use GPB continuously, other than during sleep, to substitute the mechanical ventilation.\n[15] This article reviews the common modes of mechanical. ventilation, new technologies, and specific ventilator strategies that have. been shown to be beneficial. Indications for mechanical ventilation, ventila-. tor associated pneumonia (VAP) and liberation from mechanical ventilation. are beyond the scope of this article. Perhaps one of the most confusing aspects of mechanical ventilation is. the plethora of terms and acronyms that are used. However, this subject.\n[16] Mechanical Ventilation Breathe Easy with Fresh Air in the Home Without mechanical ventilation to provide fresh air, moisture, odors, and other pollutants can build up inside a home. Improved Comfort. Mechanical ventilation systems allow a constant flow of outside air into the home and can also provide filtration, dehumidification, and conditioning of the incoming outside air.\n[17] Ventilators are medical devices that provide mechanical ventilation to assist with or replace patients' spontaneous breathing. Mechanical ventilation is often categorized based on the interface used, such as a tracheostomy tube for invasive ventilation, or a mask for non-invasive ventilation.\n[18] What Is Mechanical Ventilation? Mechanical ventilation, in the healthcare setting or home, helps patients breathe by assisting the inhalation of oxygen into the lungs and the exhalation of carbon dioxide.Depending on the patient's condition, mechanical ventilation can help support or completely control breathing.oncerns how much inspiratory or \"trigger\" effort is required from the ventilator to recognize that the patient is trying to inhale; this can refer to a ventilator setting, but can also be used to describe the ventilator's responsiveness to the patient's breathing effort. Flow of breaths.\n[19] The intentional introduction of subaerial air can be categorized as either mechanical ventilation, or natural ventilation. Mechanical ventilation uses fans to drive the flow of subaerial air into a building.\n[20] We were unable to determine the amount of the overpayment for 1 of the 363 claims. For example, for one beneficiary, the documentation (e.g., time log for the mechanical. ventilation) showed that the beneficiary had received 73 hours of mechanical. ventilation.\nSearch Query: medicare's definition of mechanical ventilation.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: example of monotonic function.\n\n[1] Monotonic Function. Monotonic functions are the functions which maintained the order of functions value. As we all know that the variation in independent value also make the variation in functions value. A suitable example for this is monotonic functions or linear polynomials. The monotonic functions maintains the straight line in linear programming graph. This is also called the monotonic nature over the domain and real numbers. A monotonic function increases and decreases over the interval.\n[2] To solidify our understanding of what a monotonic function is, let's consider what a non-monotonic function is. A non-monotonic function is a function that is increasing and decreasing on different intervals of its domain. For example, consider our initial example f(x) equals x 2.\n[3] Montonic Function. When a function is increasing on its entire domain or decreasing on its entire domain, we say that the function is strictly monotonic, and we call it a monotonic function. For example, consider the function g(x) equals x 3: Notice the graph of g is increasing everywhere. Therefore, this is a monotonic function.\n[4] An important application of monotonic functions is in probability theory. If is a random variable, its cumulative distribution function is a monotonically increasing function. A function is unimodal if it is monotonically increasing up to some point (the mode) and then monotonically decreasing. When is a strictly monotonic function, then is injective on its domain, and if is the range of, then there is an inverse function on for.\n[5] In calculus, a function defined on a subset of the real numbers with real values is called monotonic if and only if it is either entirely increasing or decreasing. It is called monotonically increasing (also increasing or nondecreasing), if for all and such that one has, so preserves the order (see Figure 1).Likewise, a function is called monotonically decreasing (also decreasing or nonincreasing) if, whenever, then, so it reverses the order (see Figure 2).If the order in the definition of monotonicity is replaced by the strict order, then one obtains a stronger requirement.A function with this property is called strictly increasing. Again, by inverting the order symbol, one finds a corresponding concept called strictly decreasing.wo facts about these functions are: 1 if is a monotonic function defined on an interval, then is differentiable almost everywhere on, i.e. the set of numbers in such that is not differentiable in has Lebesgue measure zero.\n[6] Figure 1. A monotonically increasing function (it is strictly increasing on the left and right while just non-decreasing in the middle.). Figure 2. A monotonically decreasing function. In calculus, a function f defined on a subset of the real numbers with real values is called monotonic (also monotonically increasing, increasing or non-decreasing), if for all x and y such that x \u2264 y one has f (x) \u2264 f (y), so f preserves the order (see Figure 1).\n[7] Note that just monotonic transformation of a concave function isnot necessarily concave: consider, for example f (x) = x and g (z) = z 3 .Thus the concavity of a function is not ordinal, it is cardinal property.Economic ExampleSuppose production function f (x) is concave and the cost function c (x) is convex.ote that just monotonic transformation of a concave function isnot necessarily concave: consider, for example f (x) = x and g (z) = z 3 .Thus the concavity of a function is not ordinal, it is cardinal property.Economic ExampleSuppose production function f (x) is concave and the cost function c (x) is convex.\n[8] I've never heard of monotonic being used for two (input) variables, but I suppose it would mean that, for each fixed value of y, u is a monotonic function of x, and for each fixed value of x, u is a monotonic function of y (and I expect they'd need to be either both monotonic increasing or both monotonic decreasing).\n[9] monotonic function. Monotonic Function. (or monotone function), a function whose increments \u0394f(x) = f(x\u2032) \u2212 f(x) do not change sign when \u0394x = x\u2032 \u2212 x > 0; that is, the increments are either always nonnegative or always nonpositive. Somewhat inaccurately, a monotonic function can be defined as a function that always varies in the same direction.\n[10] Monotonic Function. A monotonic function is a function which is either entirely nonincreasing or nondecreasing. A function is monotonic if its first derivative (which need not be continuous) does not change sign.\n[11] In mathematics, a monotonic function (or monotone function) is a function between ordered sets that preserves or reverses the given order. This concept first arose in calculus, and was later generalized to the more abstract setting of order theory. 1 Monotonicity in calculus and analysis.\n[12] In calculus, a function defined on a subset of the real numbers with real values is called monotonic if and only if it is either entirely increasing or decreasing. It is called monotonically increasing (also increasing or nondecreasing), if for all and such that one has, so preserves the order (see Figure 1). Likewise, a function is called monotonically decreasing (also decreasing or nonincreasing) if, whenever, then, so it reverses the order (see Figure 2).\n[13] Here's the definition of the monotonic function from Wikipedia: In calculus, a function f defined on a subset of the real numbers with real values is called monotonic (also monotonically increasing, increasing or non-decreasing), if for all x and y such that x \u2264 y one has f(x) \u2264 f(y), so f preserves the order.\n[14] \u2022 MONOTONE (adjective). The adjective MONOTONE has 2 senses: 1. of a sequence or function; consistently increasing and never decreasing or consistently decreasing and never increasing in value. 2. sounded or spoken in a tone unvarying in pitch. Familiarity information: MONOTONE used as an adjective is rare.\n[15] The term monotonic may also be used to describe set functions which map subsets of the domain to non-decreasing values of the codomain. In particular, if is a set function from a collection of sets to an ordered set , then is said to be monotone if whenever as elements of , .\n[16] Two facts about these functions are: 1 if is a monotonic function defined on an interval, then is differentiable almost everywhere on, i.e. the set of numbers in such that is not differentiable in has Lebesgue measure zero. 2 if is a monotonic function defined on an interval, then is Riemann integrable.\n[17] The MONOTONIC function is often presented as a means of adding sequence numbers to table rows. Several papers present it as a solution to this programming problem. If the MONOTONIC function is used in an SQL procedure that aggregates data then the function may return non-sequential or missing results.\n[18] Two facts about these functions are: 1 if is a monotonic function defined on an interval, then is differentiable almost everywhere on, i.e. the set of numbers in such that is not differentiable in has Lebesgue measure zero.2 In addition, this result cannot be improved to countable: see Cantor function.f the order in the definition of monotonicity is replaced by the strict order, then one obtains a stronger requirement. A function with this property is called strictly increasing. Again, by inverting the order symbol, one finds a corresponding concept called strictly decreasing.\n[19] Monotonicity criterion. This article is about a voting system criterion. For the mathematical notion of an order preserving mapping, see monotonic function. The monotonicity criterion is a voting system criterion used to evaluate both single and multiple winner ranked voting systems.\n[20] In calculus, a function defined on a subset of the real numbers with real values is called monotonic if and only if it is either entirely increasing or decreasing. It is called monotonically increasing (also increasing or nondecreasing), if for all and such that one has, so preserves the order (see Figure 1).\nSearch Query: example of monotonic function.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Summary: Suicide is ranked eighth as a cause of death in the United States and is the third leading cause of death in the 15- to 24-year age group. Schizophrenia, along with depression, is an important risk factor for suicide and attempted suicide.\n[18] Suicide occurs almost twice as often as murder. Each year, about 36,000 people in the United States die by suicide. In the U.S.: 1 Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death. 2 Suicide is the third leading cause of death for people ages 15 to 24 and the second leading cause for people ages 25 to 34. 3 Suicide rates have increased for middle-aged and older adults. 4 One suicide death occurs for every 4 suicide attempts.\n[19] The data was then compared with a previous investigation \u2013 primarily an estimation \u2013 that had been conducted over the same time period, and had found a suicide rate of 18 per day. Many of these suicides involve older veterans; 69 percent of the suicides recorded were by veterans age 50 and older. But another way to look at this is that 31 percent of these suicides were by veterans 49 and younger. In other words,by men in the prime of life. And then there are the shockingly common active duty suicides. Just two weeks ago, the military released data showing that suicides among those on active duty hit a record high in 2012. There were 349 suicides among active duty personnel \u2013 almost one a day. That means there are now more suicides among active duty soldiers than there are combat deaths.\n[20] Suicide in the United States. Suicide. In 2013 the suicide rate in the United States was 13 per 100,000 people, the highest recorded rate in 28 years. The U.S. suicide rate also rose 24% over the 15 previous years (1999-2014), In 2009, suicide was the seventh leading cause of death for males and the 16th leading cause of death for females.

I have seen goldfish grow ridiculously large in very small containers when their water was changed frequently. Goldfish will not grow if water conditions are poor. Fancy goldfish don't grow as large as Common goldfish. A good size would be around 5 inches body length for most fancy varieties, 8 inches for Comets and 12 inches for Common Goldfish. These sizes are usually only attained by pond grown fish.\n[2] A goldfish will grow to the depth of the water it is kept in.

Best Answer: Goldfish do not grow to the size of their tank, that is a myth. Goldfish grow until they are at their mature size, but being in a tank too small for them to grow properly can cause stunting. This is where the idea that they grow to the size of their tank comes from.\n[9] Goldfish Size and Life Expectancy.

The normal life expectancy of a single tail goldfish is about 20 years.\n[12] Fancy goldfish typically grow to 8 inches, while single tail goldfish grow to 10 and sometimes up to 12 inches in length. It's rare for domestic goldfish to achieve the monstrous sizes recorded in the Netherlands and Michigan; these fish were exceptions to the norm.\n[13] You will see your goldfish grow fast. The goldfish food that you feed them plays a part in their growth as well. If you want your goldfish to grow fast consider feeding them a wide variety of food. Also high growth food will help as well maximizing the growth of your goldfish.\n[14] Don't Put Goldfish in a Fish Bowl. You can put a maximum of only one 1 long goldfish in a one-gallon fish bowl, and it usually will not do well. If it does well, it will quickly grow too big for a fish bowl. Goldfish are not appropriate fish for fish bowls.\n[15] A large tank gives your goldfish plenty of room to grow to their full potential. In a small 5-gallon aquarium, your goldfish will still grow. But growth will become stunted, and your goldfish won't be able to develop properly. In such an environment, goldfish usually don't last any more than a couple of years.\n[16] For example, koi are larger than goldfish. They have long, lean bodies and can grow to be 2-3 feet long! Even when in the wild, goldfish grow to be no more than 1 foot long.fter all, both goldfish and koi come in a variety of colors. You may have even wondered if koi are goldfish that have gotten really big! Koi and goldfish are different types of fish, but they are both members of the carp family.\n[17] Goldfish are very large compared to many tropical fish species. Most fancy goldfish varieties grow up to 6 or 7 inches long (15 or 18 centimeters), while common and comet goldfish can grow to a foot long (30 centimeters) and even more. Though there are exceptions, tropical fish tend to stay small.\n[18] Goldfish may grow to a maximum length of 23 inches (59 cm) and a maximum weight of 9.9 pounds (4.5 kg), although this is rare; most individual goldfish grow to under half this size. In optimal conditions, goldfish may live more than 20 years (the world record is 49 years); however, most household goldfish generally only live six to eight years.\n[19] Get a large enough tank. The minimum tank size for one goldfish is 10-15 US gallons (56.7 liters)(Remember, they grow to about 10-12 inches (25.5-30.5 centimeters), and sometimes over!) and you will need to add 10 U.S. gallons (37.8 liters) onto that for each additional goldfish. Do your research about all different kinds of goldfish.\n[20] The Common Goldfish is an omnivourus goldfish species.It is very docile and is often fed vegetable food.The Common Goldfish can grow up to be 40 inches long!The Common Goldfish is the longest living goldfish, and the hardiest also!The Common Goldfish can live up to be 45 years old!It's color is orange.The Common Goldfish has a slim, long body and a ...\nSearch Query: do goldfish grow.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Sous vide, if you recall, is the process of cooking food in a controlled-temperature water bath, using a vacuum sealer to protect your meat from the liquid. What you get from sous vide is your food cooked to exactly the temperature you want to kill bacteria and make it safe to eat, but not overcooking it.\n[2] The sous vide technique has been the secret of great chefs worldwide for decades. The SousVide Supreme is an amazing new all-in-one sous vide water oven designed to bring the sous vide cooking technique into home kitchens and restaurants at an affordable price. The sous vide (pronounced soo-veed) technique involves cooking food in vacuum-sealed pouches submerged in a water bath held at a precisely-controlled temperature.\n[3] The term sous vide (pronounced soo\u2013veed) is a French term, meaning under vacuum. Sous vide is a culinary technique in which vacuum-sealed food is immersed in a water bath and cooked at a very precise, consistent temperature.This cooking technique typically involves cooking food for longer periods of time at a lower temperature.he term sous vide (pronounced soo\u2013veed) is a French term, meaning under vacuum. The term s ous vide (pronounced soo\u2013veed) is a French term, meaning under vacuum.\n[4] What is a Sous Vide Cooker? We said it before and we'll say it again: a sous vide machine is a better way to cook. When you use a sous vide at home, you'll be cooking with water. It's not at all what you're thinking. Your steak and chicken \u2013 any food really \u2013 will be placed in BPA-free, sturdy plastic bags and cooked.\n[5] Actually vacuum is a mis-represented concept in sous vide. Fact is, you don't need vacuum sealing entirely for sous vide cooking. If you can truly control the temperature of the water bath then all you need is to provide the food you are cooking a barrier from the water bath.\n[6] Sous vide recipes. Sous vide recipes. From the French for 'under vacuum', sous vide is a method of cooking where ingredients are sealed in an airtight bag and submerged in a water bath. This method not only ensures a constant cooking temperature, but allows the food to cook for long periods of time without losing any of its flavour or moisture.\n[7] Slow and low is the name of the game here. Some times cooking food sous vide means hours, sometimes it means entire days. Food safety is a concern, but doesn't generally an issue as long as you stick to the temperature and cooking time specified for the food you're cooking.imply put, sous vide cooking is the process of vacuum-sealing raw food in plastic pouches and cooking it slowly in a temperature-controlled water bath.\n[8] What kind of foods can you cook sous vide? Sous vide is traditionally seen as an alternative method for cooking meats. However, the technique is extremely versatile, meaning all manner of ingredients can be cooked such as: Pork, Lamb, Beef, Chicken, Duck, Turkey, Quail.\n[9] The term sous vide (pronounced soo\u2013veed) is a French term, meaning under vacuum.

The term s ous vide (pronounced soo\u2013veed) is a French term, meaning under vacuum.\n[10] Sous-vide cooking involves cooking food in sealed plastic bags immersed in hot water for long periods of time. Depending on the cut, type, and thickness of the meat or the type of food in question, cooking sous-vide for several hours is not out of the ordinary. The key is managing the temperature of the water so it stays hot enough to cook the food thoroughly and evenly, and long enough to kill any food-borne pathogens that may be in the bag along with the food.\n[11] Learn more sous vide at http://www.sousvidesupreme.com-----WHAT IS SOUS VIDE? -----The sous vide technique has been the secret of great chefs worldwide for decades. The SousVide Supreme is an amazing new all-in-one sous vide water oven designed to bring the sous vide cooking technique into home kitchens and restaurants at an affordable price.\n[12] Sous vide cooking has been called revolutionary. It's been named the best thing for cooking since the microwave. It's also been accused of being wasteful, unnatural, and just plain weird.imply put, sous vide cooking is the process of vacuum-sealing raw food in plastic pouches and cooking it slowly in a temperature-controlled water bath.\n[13] The term sous vide (pronounced soo\u2013veed) is a French term, meaning under vacuum.

From the French for 'under vacuum', sous vide is a method of cooking where ingredients are sealed in an airtight bag and submerged in a water bath. This method not only ensures a constant cooking temperature, but allows the food to cook for long periods of time without losing any of its flavour or moisture.\n[15] The cooking medium is boiling water\u2014not low temperature. Yet, because there is a vacuum process involved, it is sous-vide. That said, sous-vide is very effective for low-temp cooking because food inside the bags neither dries out nor loses flavor during prolonged cooking if proper temperature is maintained.\n[16] Sous-vide. Sous-vide is a method of cooking food sealed in airtight plastic bags in a water bath for longer than normal cooking times\u201472 hours in some cases\u2014at an accurately regulated temperature much lower than normally used for cooking, typically around 55 \u00b0C to 60 \u00b0C for meats and higher for vegetables.\n[17] For the best quality sous vide cooking bag, we recommend using only the SousVide Supreme Vacuum Sealer bags. However, our system will also work with some other bags, such as those by Food Saver. Any bag used for sous vide cooking, however, should always be made of food grade plastic and approved for cooking.\n[18] With the Anova, sous vide cooking is simple. All you need to get started is a pot or large container to hold water, heavy duty bags, a few clips, and your Anova Precision Cooker, of course! One of the best parts of sous vide cooking is that you don't need to do much to your food before cooking.\n[19] Slow-cooked eggs would be a more apt description. Very, very slow-cooked eggs even better. It's only through association with the equipment used to cook sous-vide (vacuum-sealed) foods that the term sous-vide eggs has stuck, despite the fact that there is no vacuum involved in their preparation.\n[20] Vacuum packaging also allows for a special cooking method, sous-vide. Sous-vide, French for under vacuum, involves poaching food that is vacuum sealed in a plastic bag.\nSearch Query: what types of food can you cook sous vide.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

A nerve impulse reaches the axon terminal of a presynaptic neuron; the membrane is depolarised by an action potential. 2) Depolarisation of the axon terminal during the action potential causes voltage sensitive calcium ion channels to open in the terminal knob.\n[3] The dendrites don't have terminating knobs at the end of it. The axons are what conduct action potentials away from the cell body. The axon is not an axon because it's long, it's an axon because of the existence of synaptic knobs at the axon terminals. When the axon conducts action potentials away from the cell body and the signal goes to the synaptic knob, it's going to release a neurotransmitter in response to the electrical signal.\n[4] The sequence of events at a synapse is as follows : 1) A nerve impulse reaches the axon terminal of a presynaptic neuron; the membrane is depolarised by an action potential. 2) Depolarisation of the axon terminal during the action potential causes voltage sensitive calcium ion channels to open in the terminal knob.)

Ventricular hypertrophy (VH) is thickening of the walls of a ventricle (lower chamber) of the heart. Although left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is more common, right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) can also occur, as can hypertrophy of both ventricles, that is, biventricular hypertrophy (BVH). Ventricular hypertrophy can be part of various syndromes caused by any of various underlying diseases.\n[2] Left ventricular hypertrophy: Related Topics.

In hypertrophy the heart muscle becomes thicker. This can have different causes. Left ventricular hypertrophy results from an increase in left ventricular workload, e.g., during hypertension or aortic valve stenosis. Right ventricular hypertrophy results from an increase in right ventricular workload, e.g., emphysema or pulmonary embolization. These causes are fundamentally different from hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HCM), which is a congenital misalignment of cardiomyocytes, resulting in hypertrophy.\n[4] Ventricular hypertrophy. Ventricular hypertrophy (VH) is thickening of the walls of a ventricle (lower chamber) of the heart. Although left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is more common, right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) can also occur, as can hypertrophy of both ventricles, that is, biventricular hypertrophy (BVH).\n[5] Right ventricular hypertrophy. Description, Causes and Risk Factors: Abbreviation: RVH. Right ventricular hypertrophy is the increase or the enlargement in the size of the right ventricle of the heart. The right ventricle is responsible for pumping blood towards the lungs. In the lungs, blood is mixed with oxygen and then pumped back to the left ventricle to be eventually distributed to the brain and to other parts of the body. There are several possible causes of right ventricular hypertrophy.\n[6] Left ventricular hypertrophy can occur when some factor makes your heart work harder than normal to pump blood to your body. Factors that can cause your heart to work harder include: High blood pressure (hypertension). This is the most common cause of left ventricular hypertrophy. More than one-third of people show evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy at the time of their diagnosis with hypertension. Aortic valve stenosis.\n[7] By Mayo Clinic Staff. Left ventricular hypertrophy can occur when some factor makes your heart work harder than normal to pump blood to your body. Factors that can cause your heart to work harder include: High blood pressure (hypertension). This is the most common cause of left ventricular hypertrophy. More than one-third of people show evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy at the time of their diagnosis with hypertension.\n[8] The last common cause of right ventricular hypertrophy is the ventricular septal defect. This is a disease affecting the ventricular septum. The ventricular septum, on the other hand, is the wall that divides the right and left ventricles of the heart. Symptoms of Right Ventricular Hypertrophy\n[9] Ventricular hypertrophy. Ventricular hypertrophy (VH) is thickening of the walls of a ventricle (lower chamber) of the heart.(1)(2) Although left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is more common, right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), as well as concurrent hypertrophy of both ventricles can also occur.\n[10] Left ventricular hypertrophy is enlargement and thickening (hypertrophy) of the walls of your heart's main pumping chamber (left ventricle). Left ventricular hypertrophy can develop in response to some factor \u2014 such as high blood pressure or a heart condition \u2014 that causes the left ventricle to work harder. As the workload increases, the muscle tissue in the chamber wall thickens, and sometimes the size of the chamber itself also increases.\n[11] Ventricular hypertrophy (VH) is thickening of the walls of a ventricle (lower chamber) of the heart. Although left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is more common, right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), as well as concurrent hypertrophy of both ventricles can also occur.\n[12] Ventricular hypertrophy is thickening of the walls of a ventricle of the heart. Although left ventricular hypertrophy is more common, right ventricular hypertrophy, as well as concurrent hypertrophy of both ventricles can also occur. Ventricular hypertrophy can result from a variety of conditions, both adaptive and maladaptive. For example, it occurs in what is regarded as a physiologic, adaptive process in pregnancy in response to increased blood volume; but can also occur as a consequence of v\n[13] Factors that can cause your heart to work harder include: 1 High blood pressure (hypertension). This is the most common cause of left ventricular hypertrophy. More than one-third of people show evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy at the time of their diagnosis with hypertension. Aortic valve stenosis.\n[14] Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is thickening of the heart muscle of the left ventricle of the heart, that is, left-sided ventricular hypertrophy.\n[15] What is Left Ventricular Hypertrophy? Left ventricular hypertrophy is a disorder of the heart involving the enlargement or thickening of the wall of cardiac muscle situated in the chamber of the heart known as the left ventricle.\n[16] Ventricular hypertrophy is the thickening of the ventricular walls (lower chambers) in the heart. Although left ventricular hypertrophy is more common, enlargement can also occur in the right ventricle, or both ventricles. 1 Physiology.\n[17] However, some cases with less right ventricular hypertrophy than the maximal one had a more advanced associated left ventricular hypertrophy (cases 8, 10, 22, 24, 25, 26), the thickness of the left ventricular wall ranging from 15 to 20 millimeters. Left ventricular hypertrophy was absent in one case only (case 2).\n[18] Left ventricular hypertrophy is more common in people who have uncontrolled high blood pressure. But no matter what your blood pressure is, developing left ventricular hypertrophy puts you at higher risk for a heart attack and stroke. Treating high blood pressure can help ease your symptoms and may reverse left ventricular hypertrophy.\n[19] The last common cause of right ventricular hypertrophy is the ventricular septal defect. This is a disease affecting the ventricular septum. The ventricular septum, on the other hand, is the wall that divides the right and left ventricles of the heart.\n[20] Patient Information. Left Ventricular Hypertrophy on ECG. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) means that the muscle of the left pumping chamber of the heart (left ventricle) is thickened. The left ventricle's job is to pump blood to the body, and conditions that increase the work the left ventricle has to do can lead to thickening of the muscle.\nSearch Query: causes of left ventricular hypertrophy.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Tracheids and vessel elements are distinguished by their shape; vessel elements are shorter, and are connected together into long tubes that are called vessels.Xylem also contains two other cell types: parenchyma and fibers.Xylem can be found: 1 in vascular bundles, present in non-woody plants and non-woody parts of woody plants. 2 in secondary xylem, laid down by a meristem called the vascular cambium in woody plants.n most plants, pitted tracheids function as the primary transport cells. The other type of tracheary element, besides the tracheid, is the vessel element. Vessel elements are joined by perforations into vessels. In vessels, water travels by bulk flow, as in a pipe, rather than by diffusion through cell membranes.\n[8] 13. The main cells of xylem are tracheids and vessel elements (these are only in found in angiosperms). Tracheids and vessel elements are dead cells that have lost their cytoplasm. Only their cell wall impregnated with lignin (an impermeable biopolymer) remains.3. The main cells of xylem are tracheids and vessel elements (these are only in found in angiosperms). Tracheids and vessel elements are dead cells that have lost their cytoplasm. Only their cell wall impregnated with lignin (an impermeable biopolymer) remains.\n[9] Summary: Vessels have perforations at the end plates while tracheids do not have end plates. Tracheids are derived from single individual cells while vessels are derived from a pile of cells. Tracheids are present in all vascular plants whereas vessels are confined to angiosperms.Tracheids are thin whereas vessel elements are wide. Tracheids have a much higher surface-to-volume ratio as compared to vessel elements.Vessels are broader than tracheids with which they are associated.Morphology of the perforation plate is different from that in tracheids.racheids are thin whereas vessel elements are wide. Tracheids have a much higher surface-to-volume ratio as compared to vessel elements. Vessels are broader than tracheids with which they are associated. Morphology of the perforation plate is different from that in tracheids.\n[10] Difference Between Tracheids and Vessels In plants xylem and phloem are the complex tissues which are the components parts of conductive system. In higher plants xylem contains tracheids, vessels (tracheae), xylem fibres(wood fibres) and xylem parenchyma (wood parenchyma).\n[11] While parenchyma cells do occur within what is commonly termed the xylem the more identifiable cells, tracheids and vessel elements, tend to stain red with Safranin-O. Tracheids are the more primitive of the two cell types, occurring in the earliest vascular plants.Tracheids are long and tapered, with angled end-plates that connect cell to cell. Vessel elements are shorter, much wider, and lack end plates.hile parenchyma cells do occur within what is commonly termed the xylem the more identifiable cells, tracheids and vessel elements, tend to stain red with Safranin-O. Tracheids are the more primitive of the two cell types, occurring in the earliest vascular plants.\n[12] Its major components include xylem parenchyma, xylem fibers, tracheids, and xylem vessels. Tracheids are one of the two types of tracheary elements of vascular plants. (The other being the vessel elements). A tracheid cell loses its protoplast at maturity. Thus, at maturity, it becomes one of the non-living components of the xylem.\n[13] In most plants, pitted tracheids function as the primary transport cells. The other type of tracheary element, besides the tracheid, is the vessel element. Vessel elements are joined by perforations into vessels. In vessels, water travels by bulk flow, as in a pipe, rather than by diffusion through cell membranes.n most plants, pitted tracheids function as the primary transport cells. The other type of tracheary element, besides the tracheid, is the vessel element. Vessel elements are joined by perforations into vessels. In vessels, water travels by bulk flow, as in a pipe, rather than by diffusion through cell membranes.\n[14] have xylem (but not wood!) - they have small groups of vessels arranged in a circle around the outer part of the stem. You might think that large trees would have wide vessels and tracheids, so that water filters fast through the tree, but actually its the opposite. Trees have narrow vessels and tracheids so that water filters slowly up the tree. This indeed is less efficient at carrying water, but wider vessels are more likely to cavitate. In a woody plant, the trunk is almost entirely composed of vessels and tracheids. Tracheids differ from vessels in being much narrower\n[15] Tracheid of oak shows pits along the walls. It is longer than a vessel element and has no perforation plates. Tracheids are elongated cells in the xylem of vascular plants that serve in the transport of water and mineral salts.Tracheids are one of two types of tracheary elements, vessel elements being the other. Tracheids, unlike vessel elements, do not have perforation plates.racheids provide most of the structural support in softwoods, where they are the major cell type. Because tracheids have a much higher surface to volume ratio compared to vessel elements, they serve to hold water against gravity (by adhesion) when transpiration is not occurring.\n[16] Xylem is made up of xylem vessels, tracheids ,xylem parenchyma and xylem fibers. Xylem vessels are tubelike structures joined end to end. Tracheids are elongated narrow cells. they are dead cells.Water and minerals move upwards through vessels and tracheids. Fibres are long cells with thick walls and narrow cavities.\n[17] The most distinctive xylem cells are the long tracheary elements that transport water. Tracheids and vessel elements are distinguished by their shape; vessel elements are shorter, and are connected together into long tubes that are called vessels.Xylem also contains two other cell types: parenchyma and fibers.n most plants, pitted tracheids function as the primary transport cells. The other type of tracheary element, besides the tracheid, is the vessel element. Vessel elements are joined by perforations into vessels. In vessels, water travels by bulk flow, as in a pipe, rather than by diffusion through cell membranes.\n[18] Woody angiosperms have also vessels. The mature tracheids form a column of superposed, cylindrical dead cells whose end walls have been perforated, resulting in a continuous tube called vessel (trachea) . Tracheids are found in all vascular plants and are the only conducting elements in gymnosperms and ferns.Tracheids have Pits on their end walls. Pits are not nearly as efficient for water translocation as Perforation Plates found in vessel elements.oody angiosperms have also vessels. The mature tracheids form a column of superposed, cylindrical dead cells whose end walls have been perforated, resulting in a continuous tube called vessel (trachea) . Tracheids are found in all vascular plants and are the only conducting elements in gymnosperms and ferns.\n[19] As a complex tissue, it is composed of four cell types: vessel elements, tracheids, parenchyma cells and fibers. Vessel elements, non-living, barrel-like cells, and tracheids, non-living, tapered cells, are the actual water-conducting cells of xylem tissue. The parenchyma cells function in storage and the fibers function in support. Phloem transports the carbohydrate products (sugars) of photosynthesis throughout the plant.\n[20] Several types of cells make up xylem tissue, including parenchyma as well as the tracheids and vessel members, two cell types that specialize in transferring water and minerals. Tracheids and vessel members are referred to as tracheary elements. Phloem vascular tissue contains parenchyma and has two types of cells that assist in the transport of food: sieve-tube members and sieve cells. Sieve-tube members are more specialized and are present in advanced flowering seed plants.\nSearch Query: tracheids are part of _____..\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Commonly used for genital herpes, they can also be used to treat cold sores as well as to suppress future outbreaks. The oral prescription drugs are acyclovir (brand name Zovirax), valacyclovir (Valtrex) and famciclovir (Famvir), all available in generic form.\n[11] Drug therapy is not a cure, but it can make living with the condition easier. There are three major drugs commonly used to treat genital herpes symptoms: acyclovir (Zovirax), famciclovir (Famvir), and valacyclovir (Valtrex). These are all taken in pill form. Severe cases may be treated with the intravenous (IV) drug acyclovir.\n[12] The best treatments for cold sores are prescription antiviral agents such as Zovirax (acyclovir), Valtrex (valacyclovir) and Famvir (famciclovir) taken orally, says Rao.\n[13] Famciclovir (Famvir) is sometimes used to treat the herpes virus that causes cold sores and genital herpes (as well as the virus that causes shingles). This medicine is available only by prescription and is taken orally in tablet form.\n[14] Famciclovir (Famvir) is a drug used for the treatment of genital herpes, cold sores, shingles, and chickenpox. Side effects, drug interactions, warnings and precautions, and pregnancy information should be reviewed prior to taking this medication.\n[15] These drugs can also reduce the severity and duration of symptoms when they do flare up. Drug therapy is not a cure, but it can make living with the condition easier. There are three major drugs commonly used to treat genital herpes symptoms: acyclovir (Zovirax), famciclovir (Famvir), and valacyclovir (Valtrex).These are all taken in pill form. Severe cases may be treated with the intravenous (IV) drug acyclovir.ost cases of genital herpes are caused by infection by the herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is more often the cause of cold sores or fever blisters. But it can also be a cause of genital herpes.\n[16] Hello. I have recurrent cold sores and have a Famvir prescription for this. Two weeks ago, I felt and saw redness, lumpiness and then a whitish sore that I associate with cold sores and hurriedly bolted down 1500mg of Famvir. But the sore/lesion seems to have been on the inside of my lip (the moist inner mouth), and not on my skin.\n[17] The #1 Trusted Brand for Herpes & Cold Sore \"Can I use ProsurX with prescription medication like Valacyclovir (Valtrex), Acyclovir or Famvir?\" Yes, you can.\n[18] Exclusive of the antiretroviral agents used in HIV (AIDS) therapy, there are currently only 11 antiviral drugs available, covering four types of virus. Acyclovir (Zovirax), famciclovir (Famvir), and valacyclovir (Valtrex) are effective against herpesvirus, including herpes zoster and herpes genitalis.\n[19] They can lower the amount of healing time when you take them at the first sign of a cold sore -- like tingly, red or itchy skin. You'll start acyclovir before cold sores fully flare and take it five times a day for 5 days, or you can take valacyclovir (Valtrex) at the first sign of a cold sore and then 12 hours later. Famciclovir (Famvir) can be given as a single dose of medicine.\n[20] Treatment. Shingles is often treated with oral antiviral drugs: acyclovir (Zovirax), famciclovir (Famvir) or valacyclovir (Valtrex). These medicines should be started within the first 3 days of the onset of the rash. In fact, the sooner the medication is started the better. These medications are generally safe and well tolerated.\nSearch Query: what is famvir prescribed for.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

If you try this with a fir needle, it won't roll at all because it's flat. Like spruce needles, fir needles don't grow in bundles, either. Like spruce trees, fir trees tend to be tall, dark and symmetrical. Like pine trees, some types of fir trees are used for Christmas trees.\n[19] Spruce and fir trees have their needles attached individually to the branches. To tell spruce and fir trees apart, it helps to know that spruce needles are sharply pointed, square and easy to roll between your fingers. Fir needles, on the other hand, are softer, flat and cannot be rolled between your fingers. Spruce needles are attached to small, stalk-like woody projections. When needles are shed, these projections remain. As a result, the branches of spruce trees feel rough.\n[20] Not many plants can survive the extreme cold of the taiga winter.

Active margins form primarily along the boundaries of plates that are actively converging. Passive margins currently exist in the middle of plates, not at plate boundaries.\n[4] Active continental margins form primarily along the boundaries of plates that are actively converging and where one plate is sinking beneath the other. Active margins mark the continents that border the Pacific Ocean where oceanic plates are subducting beneath continental plates.assive continental margin: A continental margin that has a broad continental shelf, a gentle continental slope, and a pronounced continental rise; it is marked by a lack of earthquake and volcanic activity. Plates: Large sections of Earth's lithosphere separated by deep fault zones.\n[5] What is 'Marginal Analysis'. Marginal analysis is an examination of the additional benefits of an activity compared to the additional costs incurred by that same activity. Companies use marginal analysis as a decision-making tool to help them maximize their potential profits.\n[6] Both passive and active continental margins are located near coastlines. The main difference is that active margins are the main sites where tectonic activity takes place (lik \u2026 e earthquakes). This is because the continental shelf of active continental margins collide with an oceanic plate, creating subduction.\n[7] 1 A Continental Margin is a boundary between continental crust and oceanic crust. 2 Active continental margins occur along plate boundaries, while passive continental margins occur at the boundary that marks a continent and the oceanic crust. 3 Mountain building takes place along active continental margins only.\n[8] Financial analysis.

Individuals unconsciously use marginal analysis to make a host of everyday decisions.\n[11] A continental margin that has a broad continental shelf, a gentle continental slope, and a pronounced continental rise is known as a passive continental margin. This type of margin experiences little, if any, volcanic or earthquake activity. The build-up of sediment is the primary activity affecting a passive margin.\n[12] Profile illustrating the shelf, slope and rise. The continental margin is the zone of the ocean floor that separates the thin oceanic crust from thick continental crust.Together, the continental shelf, continental slope, and continental rise are called continental margin. Continental margins constitute about 28% of the oceanic area.arthquakes and volcanic eruptions are common on the west coast of North America, but there are no active volcanoes on the east coast and large magnitude earthquakes are rare. Geologists refer to the west coast as (tectonically) active continental margin and the east coast a passive continental margin.\n[13] Passive margin. A passive margin is the transition between oceanic and continental lithosphere that is not an active plate margin. A passive margin forms by sedimentation above an ancient rift, now marked by transitional lithosphere. Continental rifting creates new ocean basins.\n[14] Making the world better, one answer at a time. Passive continental margins are not areas of convergence. There is little volcanic and earthquake activity on passive margins. Active margins are areas of convergence where one plate is descending beneath another. They are associated with volcanic and earthquake activity.\n[15] the continental margin is the submerged outer edge of a continent it is generally divided into two sections the continental shelf and the continental slope the continental shelf is the region that extends seaward from the shoreline to a sharp drop off that marks the beginning of the continental slope continental margin that has a broad continental shelf a gentle continental slope and a pronounced continental rise is known as a passive continental margin this type of margin experiences little if any volcanic or earthquake activity the build up of sediment is the primary activity affecting a passive margin\n[16] In general, the continental shelves bordering active margins are narrower than those along passive margins. The trench marks the deepest seaward termination of the active continental margin. It coincides with the surface trace of the subduction fault marking the boundary between the converging plates.\n[17] DEFINITION of 'Marginal Analysis'.

Marginal analysis is also widely used in microeconomics when analyzing how a complex system is affected by marginal manipulation of its comprising variables.\n[18] The continental margins along India and Antarctica are other examples of passive margins. A continental margin that has a very narrow, or even nonexistent, continental shelf and a narrow and steep continental slope is known as an active continental margin. Instead of ending in a continental rise, the continental slope of this type of margin often plunges into a deep-ocean trench, which may be filled with sediment.\n[19] Companies use marginal analysis as a decision-making tool to help them maximize their profits.

Contour plowing or contour farming or Contour bunding is the farming practice of plowing and/or planting across a slope following its elevation contour lines. These contour lines create a water break which reduces the formation of rills and gullies during times of heavy water run-off; which is a major cause of soil erosion.\n[2] Contour plowing is the act of farming on a hill or a contoured area. The plow follows the contours of the land horizontally helping to reduce runoff of water. This practice helps to prevent soil erosion in hilly and contoured areas by capturing the water runoff using water breaks to keep water contained. Contour plowing is also known as contour farming, and is a sustainable form of agriculture.\n[3] In contour plowing, the land is plowed across the slopes and along the contour lines. This will also reduce soil erosion and make rainwater infiltrate into the soil more than on land plowed along the slope. Terraces are more effective than contour plowing alone in minimizing soil erosion and facilitating infiltration f rainfall into the soil.\n[4] Contour bunding, Catalonia, 2007.

On December 8 1991, leaders of Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine met at the nature reserve called Belovezhskaya Pushcha in Belarus. They discussed the creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). They reached an agreement about many points and signed a document creating the CIS.

Parietal peritoneum is the shiny lining of the abdominal cavity, visceral peritoneum is the shiny outer surface of the abdominal viscera and the cavity is between the two.\n[3] Type 2 diabetes can be caused by storing high amounts of visceral fat. Visceral fat is body fat that is stored within the abdominal cavity and is therefore stored around a number of important internal organs such as the liver, pancreas and intestines.t is important to define the difference between visceral fat and subcutaneous fat. Subcutaneous fat is the fat that we store just under our skin. The fat we may be able to feel on our arms and legs is subcutaneous fat. A growing belly can be the result of both types of fat.\n[4] define and distinguish visceral vs. parietal parts of serous membranes. Visceral parts of serous membrane is the part of the serous membrane that sits on the organ. The parietal parts of a serous membrane is the part that lines the surface of the cavity that holds the organ.\n[5] The term visceral obesity defines excessive fat accumulation around the organs within the abdominal cavity. The terms central or abdominal obesity, or belly fat, describe fat accumulation in the upper part of the body and don't differentiate between visceral or subcutaneous fat accumulation. Usually, belly fat is a combination of both.\n[6] Examine the parietal pleura and its relation to the chest wall. Identify cupula, the two pleural sacs, and the lateral surface of the lungs covered with visceral pleura. Define parietal and visceral pleura. Note the point of continuity between the two, the hilar reflection, at the hilum of the lung.\n[7] Lesson Summary. In summary, each pleural cavity is defined by a space surrounding each lung and lined by a pleural membrane. Each pleural cavity is lined by a pleural membrane that is composed of two layers. The visceral pleura surrounds the outside of the lung.he pleural membrane is made up of two layers. These layers can be illustrated in a transverse section of the thoracic cavity.
