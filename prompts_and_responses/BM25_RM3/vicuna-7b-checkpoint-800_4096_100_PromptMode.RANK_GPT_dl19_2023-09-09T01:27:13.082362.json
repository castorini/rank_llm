Eventually, the original pet, or a new one, may eat some of these fleas and the parasite\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life cycle repeats. This can occur again and again. There are many kinds of tapeworm.\n[2] The total flea life cycle can range from a couple weeks to several months, depending on environmental conditions. ADULT: The adult flea is very flat side to side. There are hair-like bristles on the flea body and legs to aid in their navigation through pet hair.\n[3] How long is the life span of a flea? 30-90 Days (Average). A flea might live a year and a half under ideal conditions. These include the right temperature, food supply, and humidity. Generally speaking, though, an adult flea only lives for 2 or 3 months. Without a host for food, a flea's life might be as short as a few days. But with ample food supply, the adult flea will often live up to 100 days.\n[4] Since a female flea can lay about 40 eggs per day, a few case studies have shown that for each flea you find, there are an estimated 120 eggs (or a further stage of the flea development cycle) around your home (see photo of flea eggs above) or garden.\n[5] Like many other parasites, tapeworms require a living host \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in particular, any host with a spine \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to continue their life cycles. However, a portion of their lives is spent outside of a human or animal host, typically in soil or feces. For instance, fleas in their larval stage consume the tapeworm eggs.When an animal eats the flea, tapeworm eggs are released in the system and migrate to the intestine. Animals in the wild are at particular risk.efore you think about killing tapeworm larvae in the soil, it may be helpful to understand this parasite\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life cycle and how it travels from host to host. Many types of tapeworm exist that infect humans and animals. Some are rare or nonexistent in the U.S., while others thrive around the world.\n[6] How long is the life span of a flea? 30-90 Days (Average). A flea might live a year and a half under ideal conditions. These include the right temperature, food supply, and humidity. Generally speaking, though, an adult flea only lives for 2 or 3 months. Without a host for food, a flea's life might be as short as a few days.\n[7] Completion of the life cycle from egg to adult varies from two weeks to eight months. Normally the female flea lays about 15 to 20 eggs per day up to 600 in a lifetime. Usual hosts for fleas are dogs, cats, rats, rabbits, mice, squirrels, chipmunks, raccoons, opossums, foxes, chickens, and humans.\n[8] Oral Flea Formulas for Cats. Fleas can cause skin irritations, hair loss and inflammation. Part your kitty's fur and you may see a flea scurry for deeper cover. It's annoying, but flea infestation is something pet owners face. A number of flea products work, but oral flea formulas for cats serve specific needs to help end the dreaded flea cycle.\n[9] Advantage my be used as the only product for fleas control as it breaks the life cycle and kills all fleas emerging in the environment, so the premises is quickly eradicated of fleas.

Contrary to belief, fleas cannot go through several generations without having a blood meal. The entire life cycle (Figure 5) of a flea can require two weeks to two years. Hot, wet, summer months favor egg laying.\n[11] Getting rid of fleas on your dog or cat alone does not treat the overall flea problem. During the flea cycle only about 5% of fleas are actually living on your dog or cat. The other 95% of fleas are living in your house or yard.\n[12] The flea population is typically. made up of 50% eggs, 1 Completion of the life cycle from egg to adult varies from two weeks to eight months.

Usual hosts for fleas are dogs, cats, rats, rabbits, mice, squirrels, chipmunks, raccoons, opossums, foxes, chickens, and humans.\n[17] However, completely developed adult fleas can live for several months without eating, so long as they do not emerge from their puparia. Optimum temperatures for the flea's life cycle are 21 \u00c2\u00b0C to 30 \u00c2\u00b0C (70 \u00c2\u00b0F to 85 \u00c2\u00b0F) and optimum humidity is 70%. Adult female rabbit fleas, Spilopsyllus cuniculi, can detect the changing levels of cortisol and corticosterone hormones in the rabbit's blood that indicate it is getting close to giving birth.\n[18] There are four stages in a flea's life: egg, larva (maggoty-like-thing), pupa (in a cocoon) and adult. Egg-to-egg life cycle is usually two to four weeks. Under the right conditions this can be a little shorter (12 days), or much longer (8 months).\n[19] Remember that what you see on your pet is only the five percent of the total population of the flea infestation. 95 percent can be found inside your home or in your yard.

Adult cat fleas do not willingly leave their hosts, and inter-animal transfer of adult fleas is rare except in animals that share sleeping quarters.\n[6] Cat Owners. Fleas. Fleas are the most common external parasite found on cats (and dogs). (Parasites are freeloaders that live in or on another creature.) Although fleas are more likely to be a problem during warm-weather months, they can also cause problems during cooler seasons due to their ability to continue their life cycle indoors.\n[7] The flea life cycle has four stages: Egg: An adult female flea can lay up to 40 eggs a day. The eggs are laid on the host \u00e2\u0080\u008bbut will dry and fall off that host into the environment (pet bedding, carpet, etc). Eggs typically hatch within about two days.\n[8] The adult cat flea can survive on the host and maintain some reproduction for 2-4 weeks under most natural conditions, but if not killed prematurely an adult flea may live as long as 4 months. For the full life cycle please see the link. Source(s): http://www.flea-info.com/about_fleas/en/...\n[9] In the UK, the two most common types of dog worms are roundworms and tapeworms. Some have complex life histories and may infest more than one type of animal in their life cycle. A good example of this is the flea tapeworm.Here the maggot-like flea immature stage eats the eggs produced by the tapeworm.ost responsible dog owners know that they should be worming their dog but there are many myths regarding why to worm, how often to worm and what to worm with.\n[10] fleas are the intermediate host for dipylidium caninum in other words the tapeworm is unable to complete its life cycle without the presence of fleas in the environment regardless of whether the owner may have seen fleas the cat must have ingested a flea in order to have tapewormshe other common tapeworms that can infect a cat are members of a group called taenia the intermediate hosts of these tapeworms are mice birds or rabbits in a similar manner to dipylidium transmission cats acquire taenia infestations by eating infected mice birds or rabbits\n[11] How long is the life span of a flea? 30-90 Days (Average).

Fleas survive an average of eight days on a short-haired dog, and they typically last longer on a host with longer hair. Fleas need a food source to survive and reproduce to continue their life cycle, and a healthy flea can lay around 27 eggs each day.\n[7] Estimates are that for every adult flea on your pet, there are around 10 more wherever your pet spends time. That's why you must eliminate not only the adults on your dog or cat, but the eggs, larva and pupa in your home, yard and your pet's bedding. The pupa stage is the most problematic because the cocoon is quite resistant to agents that can kill fleas in the other stages of the life cycle.\n[8] Completely developed adult fleas can live for several months without eating, as long as they do not emerge from their cacoons. Newly emerged adult fleas live only about one week if a blood meal is not obtained.

The complete life cycle of the flea takes about four weeks, varying according to the temperature. The female fleas lay at night while attached to the bird, and the very small eggs fall to the ground. In about four days, small wormlike larvae emerge from the eggs. The larvae feed on organic material, mainly the dried blood excreted by the adult fleas, and shelter in the surface dust and litter on the soil.

The pupa stage is the most problematic because the cocoon is quite resistant to agents that can kill fleas in the other stages of the life cycle.\nSearch Query: how long is life cycle of flea.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

The flea lays eggs and the eggs hatch (and look like tiny worms). The worms (called the larval stage) develop a cocoon type barrier (called the pupal stage) where they transform into an adult flea (like a caterpillar becoming a butterfly).\n[2] In order to control fleas effectively, you must understand the flea life cycle. Though there are several species of fleas that can infest your home, by far the most common species found on cats or dogs is the cat flea (Ctenocephalides felis), so I will focus on cat fleas in this article.\n[3] Fleas go through four life cycle stages of egg, larva, pupa, and imago (adult). Adult fleas must feed on blood before they can become capable of reproduction. Flea populations are distributed with about 50% eggs, 35% larvae, 10% pupae, and 5% adults.\n[4] Oral flea treatments are given in pill form every 30 days. They work in a similar fashion as the topical treatment, by breaking up the life cycle of the flea and prohibiting flea eggs and larvae from developing. Oral treatments can also be used in conjunction with bathing products to kill adult fleas.at flea products are the only sure way rid your cat and your home of those annoying irritants. General home care will aid in the effectiveness of any cat flea product that you choose. There are flea collars, topical treatments, oral treatments, shampoos and sprays. Any combination of these solutions can be productive.\n[5] Capstar is safe for dogs, cats, puppies and kittens 4 weeks of age and older. This product, made by Elanco, contains Spinosad for killing fleas. It is a chewable tablet that begins killing fleas within 30 minutes and kills the flea before it is able to lay eggs, thus breaking the flea life cycle.\n[6] 1 Fleas pass through a complete life cycle of four stages. made up of 50% eggs, 30% larvae, 15% pupae and only 5% biting adults. 1 Completion of the life cycle from egg to adult varies from two weeks to eight months. Normally the female flea lays about 15 to 20 eggs per day up to 600 in a lifetime.\n[7] 6 weeks. In 3 weeks, one flea can pass through its entire life cycle and can lay 1000 eggs. In another 3 weeks, those eggs can hatch and lay 1,000 eggs each, so within 6 weeks, it is possible to have a million new fleas. weeks. In 3 weeks, one flea can pass through its entire life cycle and can lay 1000 eggs. In another 3 weeks, those eggs can hatch and lay 1,000 eggs each, so within 6 weeks, it is possible to have a million new fleas.\n[8] It's estimated that with any flea population, 95% of all these parasites are in a sub-adult stage (i.e., eggs, larvae, or pupa). These sub-adult fleas can lie dormant in your home for several months before they hatch and start the cycle all over again. Stages of a Flea's Life.\n[9] The Flea Life Cycle. Fleas undergo complete metamorphosis with four stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Environmental variables influence the length of each developmental stage. Fleas prefer a warm, humid environment, with temperatures ranging between 70\u00c2\u00b0 and 90\u00c2\u00b0 Fahrenheit and a relative humidity of 75% or more.\n[10] Life cycle and habitat[edit] Fleas are holometabolous insects, going through the four lifecycle stages of egg, larva, pupa, and imago (adult). Adult fleas must feed on blood before they can become capable of reproduction. Flea populations are distributed with about 50% eggs, 35% larvae, 10% pupae, and 5% adults.\n[11] Author's note: As will be explained later (in sections 2e and 2f), the flea cocoon stage of the fleas life cycle can lay dormant for a long period of time (up to 1 year), waiting for a host animal to come along to trigger it to hatch.\n[12] Stickfast flea life history. The complete life cycle of the flea takes about four weeks, varying according to the temperature. The female fleas lay at night while attached to the bird, and the very small eggs fall to the ground. In about four days, small wormlike larvae emerge from the eggs. The larvae feed on organic material, mainly the dried blood excreted by the adult fleas, and shelter in the surface dust and litter on the soil. After several moults, they grow to about 3 mm, cease to feed and burrow down into the soil to a depth of about 15 cm.\n[13] Under ideal conditions, the cat flea life cycle takes just 18 days, from egg to adult. Adult fleas (both male and female) require a blood meal prior to mating. They prefer blood from your pet, but in the absence of a canine or feline host, fleas will bite people.\n[14] Fleas prefer a warm, humid environment, with temperatures ranging between 70\u00c2\u00b0 and 90\u00c2\u00b0 Fahrenheit and a relative humidity of 75% or more. Under ideal conditions, the cat flea life cycle takes just 18 days, from egg to adult. Adult fleas (both male and female) require a blood meal prior to mating.\n[15] The whole cycle can be as quick as 20 days or can last up to one full year; this is because the flea may be in a dormant stage for a long time. The cycle can be interrupted at any stage, but some flea control methods are more effective than others depending upon the stage the flea is in.\n[16] The flea population is typically. made up of 50% eggs, 30% larvae, 15% pupae and only 5% biting adults. Completion of the life cycle from egg to adult varies from two weeks to eight months. Normally the female flea lays about 15 to 20 eggs per day up to 600 in a lifetime. Usual hosts for fleas are dogs, cats, rats, rabbits, mice, squirrels, chipmunks, raccoons, opossums, foxes, chickens, and humans.\n[17] Life Cycle (Back to Top). The cat flea life cycle is one of complete metamorphosis, involving the stages of an egg, larva, pupa, and adult. This cycle usually lasts 30 to 75 days, yet may vary due to external factors, such as temperature and humidity.\n[18] The flea life cycle has four stages: Egg: An adult female flea can lay up to 40 eggs a day. The eggs are laid on the host \u00e2\u0080\u008bbut will dry and fall off that host into the environment (pet bedding, carpet, etc). Eggs typically hatch within about two days.\n[19] There are four stages in a flea's life: egg, larva (maggoty-like-thing), pupa (in a cocoon) and adult. Egg-to-egg life cycle is usually two to four weeks. Under the right conditions this can be a little shorter (12 days), or much longer (8 months).\n[20] Completion of the life cycle from egg to adult varies from two weeks to eight months. Normally the female flea lays about 15 to 20 eggs per day up to 600 in a lifetime.

One of the most important things is life cycle of the flea, which depending on the environmental temperature and humidity levels can take between a couple of week to many months. There are four stages in the life cycle of a flea: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Here we will discuss all four\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.\n[2] Boric acid is more effective in killing eggs and larva than adult fleas. This means that it will take two to six weeks for the adult population of fleas to die off, but the application of Borax will end the cycle of flea life with that generation. Borax is potent for long periods of time. If new fleas get into your home, Borax left in the carpet and furniture will kill off the eggs and larva that these new fleas will create, limiting the infestation to the initial generation. Step 1 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Clean the House. It is important to begin by cleaning up.\n[3] The flea life cycle is very important to know if a flea infestationis to be controlled adequately and permanently (after all, much of the flea life cycle occurs in the animal's environment, not on the animal itself, and so environmental flea control is very important).\n[4] The flea is the key. Fleas are the key to tapeworm infection in dogs, cats and people. It takes a flea ingesting an infective egg to complete the life cycle of the tapeworm. That infected flea then has to be devoured, delivering its tapeworm egg cargo into the host\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intestinal tract.\n[5] The flea life cycle. Adult fleas spend most of their time on your dog or cat. They can live up to two years and a female will start laying eggs within two days of finding a host. The eggs that are laid by females fall off the cat or dog into the environment along with \u00e2\u0080\u0098flea dirts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (flea excrement).\n[6] Stickfast flea life history. The complete life cycle of the flea takes about four weeks, varying according to the temperature. The female fleas lay at night while attached to the bird, and the very small eggs fall to the ground. In about four days, small wormlike larvae emerge from the eggs. The larvae feed on organic material, mainly the dried blood excreted by the adult fleas, and shelter in the surface dust and litter on the soil.\n[7] There are four stages in the life cycle of a flea: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Depending on the environmental temperature and humidity levels, the total life cycle will take anywhere from a couple weeks to many months. Optimal conditions for fleas are between 70-85\u00c2\u00b0F and 70 percent humidity.\n[8] Flea Eggs. A female flea can lay around 20 to 25 eggs in one day. The flea egg stage is the beginning of the flea cycle. This part of the flea cycle represents a little more than one third of the flea population at any given time. Depending on the temperature and humidity of the environment the egg can take from two to six days to hatch.\n[9] Fleas pass through a complete life cycle of four stages. 30% larvae, 15% pupae and only 5% biting adults. Completion of the life cycle from egg to adult varies from two weeks to eight months. Normally the female flea lays about 15 to 20 eggs per day up to 600 in a lifetime.\n[10] Completely developed adult fleas can live for several months without eating, as long as they do not emerge from their cacoons. Newly emerged adult fleas live only about one week if a blood meal is not obtained. Optimum temperatures for the flea's life cycle are 70\u00c2\u00b0F to 85\u00c2\u00b0F and optimum humidity is 70 percent. Breaking the cycle with an Insect Growth Regulator , not just killing the few adults is the secret to flea control.\n[11] 1 Fleas pass through a complete life cycle of four stages. made up of 50% eggs, 30% larvae, 15% pupae and only 5% biting adults. 1 Completion of the life cycle from egg to adult varies from two weeks to eight months.

Advantage II for cats provides multi-stage flea control effectively breaking all flea life-cycle stages for lasting control of flea populations.\n[3] The flea life cycle is such that the fleas that are seen on your pet are only a small proportion of the total flea population. 95% of the problem exists in the pet's environment as flea eggs, larvae and pupae (cocoons).\n[4] PROS: 1 Topical treatment for fleas, ticks and lice. 2 Active ingredient is the insect growth regulator, S-methoprene, which kills flea eggs and larvae. 3 Kills fleas, flea eggs, flea larvae, ticks and chewing lice for up to 30 days. 4 Stops the flea life cycle and kills flea eggs and larvae for up to 12 weeks.\n[5] The pupa is the life cycle stage of the flea that is the most vitalto a flea population's persistence in a host environment. The reason why this stage of the flea life cycleis so important to the flea population as a whole is because of the fact that flea cocoons generally only hatch in the presence of a host animal.\n[6] LIFE CYCLE. Unlike most fleas, adult cat fleas remain on the host where feeding, mating, and egg laying occur. Females lay about 20 to 50 eggs per day. Cat flea eggs are pearly white, oval, and about 1/32 inch long (Figure 3).\n[7] Only the remaining 5% of the problem are the fleas actually seen on your pet. Applying a flea treatment for dogs and cats such as FRONTLINE PLUS every month will kill adult fleas on the pet and prevent further infestation of the environment with eggs.

Two Parts: Treating Your Home for Fleas Treating Your Pet for Fleas. Fleas are small, agile insects that live by feeding on the blood of other animals, usually your furry and harmless cat or dog. Fleas can be a real problem when they invade a household and its inhabitants. It is best not to use salt in homes where the air conditioner is not running continuously. 2 Because of the long flea life cycle, two or three treatment spaced three weeks apart are often needed to completely rid your home of a flea infestation. 3 Be sparing with the use of insecticides.\n[9] The pupae stage of the flea life cycle accounts for about 10 percent of the flea population in a home. This cocoon stage is the last developmental stage before the adult flea emerges. The cocoon protects the pupae for several days or weeks before the adult flea emerges.\n[10] Fleas eat the tapeworm eggs and the tapeworm eggs hatch in the fleas and grow. Then, the cycle starts again when the dog eats the flea. Therefore, the most common type of tapeworm get to be on dog's because of fleas, who transmit them and aid them in their life cycle.\n[11] When it comes to eliminating fleas from your pet and from your home, there are some key things to consider.

It depends on how long the flea remains in the dormant stage (eggs, larvae, pupa). Outside influences, such as weather, affect the flea cycle. A female flea can lay around 20 to 25 eggs in one day. The flea egg stage is the beginning of the flea cycle. This part of the flea cycle represents a little more than one third of the flea population at any given time. Depending on the temperature and humidity of the environment the egg can take from two to six days to hatch.\n[2] 2) The fleas life cycle discussed - the flea life cycle diagram explained in full. 2a) Fleas life cycle 1 - The adult flea lays her eggs on the host animal. 2b) Fleas life cycle 2 - The egg falls off the animal's skin and into the local environment of the host animal. 2c) Fleas life cycle 3 - The flea egg hatches, releasing a first stage (stage 1) flea larva.\n[3] The life cycle of a flea can last anywhere from 20 days to an entire year.

Larvae make up about 35 percent of the flea population in the average household. If conditions are favorable, the larvae will spin cocoons in about 5-20 days of hatching from their eggs.This leads to the next life stage, called the cocoon or pupae stage.The pupae stage of the flea life cycle accounts for about 10 percent of the flea population in a home.f conditions are favorable, the larvae will spin cocoons in about 5-20 days of hatching from their eggs.

The table below gives the value for the ion product for water, Kw, at various temperatures.\n[3] As the temperature is increased they will melt and become liquids. Each element melts at a different temperature, called it's melting point. Hydrogen melts at -259 degrees Celsius. Mercury melts at -39 degrees Celsius. Iron melts at 1,535 degrees Celsius. As the temperature is increased still further, each element will boil and become a gas. Each element boils at a different temperature, called the boiling point.\n[4] In my experiment I will be freezing liquids, milk, raspberry lemonade, diet Pepsi, and water. Each of those liquids freezes and I will be melting them to see if what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in them effects how fast they melt. When a solid melts to a liquid it goes through a phase change called melting.The normal freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius, so if the temperature is above that then ice will melt.In order to see if what is in my liquids affects how fast they melt, I found out what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s is in them.Water is hydrogen and oxygen and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about it, but 1% milk is made out of protein, sugar, salt, fat, milk and vitamins A and D.

The main concern in working with hydrogen is flammability. Liquid hydrogen is sometimes used as an extremely condensed hydrogen fuel; it is also used as a coolant for electric generators in power stations. 2 Hydrogen is also used as a feedstock in industrial processes including production of ammonia and methanol.\n[6] At the temperature of the boiling point, the liquid turns into a gas. The molecules are not in contact each other in the gaseous state. Water Liquid to Water Gas: This animation shows how water molecules are able to break the forces of attraction i.e. the hydrogen bonds to each other and escape as the gas molecule.\n[7] Hydrogen peroxide, in both liquid and as vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP), is another chemical sterilizing agent. Hydrogen peroxide is strong oxidant, which allows it to destroy a wide range of pathogens. Hydrogen peroxide is used to sterilize heat or temperature sensitive articles such as rigid endoscopes.\n[8] Rank dipole-dipole forces, dispersion forces, and hydrogen bonds in order of increasing strength... dispersion forces, dipole-dipole forces, hydrogen bonds. T/F: The constant motion of the particles in a liquid causes the liquid to take the shape of its container. T/F: At room temperature and one atmospher of air pressure, the density of a liquid is much greater than that of its vapor.\n[9] Most of the trans fat in the foods we eat is formed through a manufacturing process that adds hydrogen to vegetable oil, which converts the liquid into a solid fat at room temperature. This process is called hydrogenation. Partially hydrogenated oils are the major source of artificial trans fats in the food supply.\n[10] The speed of sound in a material, particularly in a gas or liquid, varies with temperature because a change in temperature affects the material's density. In air, for example, the speed of sound increases with an increase in temperature.At 32 \u00c2\u00b0F. (0 \u00c2\u00b0C.), the speed of sound in air is 1,087 feet per second (331 m/s); at 68 \u00c2\u00b0F. (20 \u00c2\u00b0C.), it is 1,127 feet per second (343 m/s).he effect of elasticity and density on the speed of sound can be seen by comparing the speed of sound in air, hydrogen, and iron. Air and hydrogen have nearly the same elastic properties, but the density of hydrogen is less than that of air. Sound thus travels faster (about 4 times as fast) in hydrogen than in air.\n[11] At STP (standard temperature and pressure) hydrogen is a gas. It cools to a liquid at -423 \u00c2\u00b0F, which is only about 37 degrees above absolute zero. Eleven degrees cooler, at \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 -434 \u00c2\u00b0F, it starts to solidify.\n[12] Confidence votes 11.4K. At STP (standard temperature and pressure) hydrogen is a gas.

Water is a liquid at standard ambient temperature and pressure, but it often co-exists on Earth with its solid state, ice; and gaseous state, steam (water vapor).s a chemical compound, a water molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms that are connected by covalent bonds. Water is a liquid at standard ambient temperature and pressure, but it often co-exists on Earth with its solid state, ice; and gaseous state, steam (water vapor).\n[14] No. Liquid metallic hydrogen only forms when hydrogen is subjected to extreme pressure. Hydrogen is present in trace amounts in Earth's atmosphere in gas form, under low p\u00e2\u0080\u00a6ressure. The core is composed primarily of iron. Liquid metallic hydrogen likely exists in the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn.\n[15] Jupiter is composed of a relatively small rocky core, surrounded by metallic hydrogen, surrounded by liquid hydrogen, which is surrounded by gaseous hydrogen. There is no clear boundary or surface between these different phases of hydrogen; the conditions blend smoothly from gas to liquid as one descends.\n[16] (1) Jupiter is about 70% hydrogen by mass, but 90% of Jupiter's atoms are hydrogen. (2) Below the roughly 1000-kilometer-thick atmosphere, a layer of liquid hydrogen is believed to extend to a depth of 20,000 kilometers.\n[17] The composition of Jupiter's interior is mostly the simple molecules hydrogen, in the form of liquid. Under the cloud layers, when the pressure of the interior becomes high enough, the hydrogen of which Jupiter is made changes to liquid hydrogen, which gradually changes further to liquid metallic hydrogen.The core of Jupiter is made out of heavier, rocky and. elements.nder the cloud layers, when the pressure of the interior becomes high enough, the hydrogen of which Jupiter is made changes to liquid hydrogen, which gradually changes further to liquid metallic hydrogen.

The state of a molecule is determined by intermo\u00e2\u0080\u00a6lecular forces, such as dipole-dipole interactions, Van der Waals forces (also called London dispersion forces), and hydrogen bonds.\n[19] Hydrogen bonds hold the two strands of DNA together and is a component of the Base pairing in nucleic acids. Hydrogen bonding allows water to remain liquid at room temperature when it would otherwise be a gas. It allows a number of nitrogen and oxygen containing compounds (such as glucose and urea) to pass easily through the body. Hydrogen bonds hold the two strands of DNA together and is a component of the Base pairing in nucleic acids.\n[20] At room temperature, ammonia, N \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 H3, is a gas. It becomes a liquid if cooled below -28 degrees F, and will freeze into a solid once below -108 degrees F. Household ammonia is liquid at room temperature; it is a solution of ammonia in water.\nSearch Query: hydrogen is a liquid below what temperature.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

At normal room temperature HCl is called hydrogen chloride and it is a gas. If you dissolve this gas in water, it becomes hydrochloric acid, which is a liquid. It all depends on the exact wording of the question. Source(s):\n[2] A small number of plant fats are also naturally solid or semisolid at room temperature. Plant fats that are usually liquid at room temperature can be transformed into a solid fat if they undergo a process called hydrogenation in which hydrogen is added to the plant oil.\n[3] Interesting Facts about Hydrogen. 1 Scientists estimate that Hydrogen makes up over 90 percent of all the atoms in the universe. 2 It is the only element that can exist without neutrons. 3 Hydrogen becomes a liquid at very low temperature and high pressure. Under extremely high pressure it can become a liquid metal.\n[4] Elements appear in their natural phase at room temperature as gas, liquid, solid or synthetic. For a complete list of the different states of matter, visit Wikipedia's page. Gas. Argon, chlorine, fluorine, helium, hydrogen, krypton, neon, nitrogen, oxygen, radon, and xenon. Liquid. Bromine and mercury.\n[5] The liquid vegetable oil is then heated to high temperatures and a catalyst (commonly nickel, but could be palladium, platinum or rhodium) is added. Hydrogen is bubbled through the liquid. The mixture is then filtered to remove the metal, leaving hydrogenated vegetable oil.\n[6] Hydrogen Bonding and Water. Hydrogen bonds account for some important qualities of water. Even though a hydrogen bond is only 5% as strong as a covalent bond, it's enough to stabilize water molecules. 1 Hydrogen bonding causes water to remain liquid over a wide temperature range. 2 Because it takes extra energy to break hydrogen bonds, water has an unusually high heat of vaporization. Water has a much higher boiling point than other hydrides. There are many important consequences of the effects of hydrogen bonding between water molecules: Hydrogen bonding makes ice less dense than liquid water, so ice floats on water.\n[7] Although carbon dioxide has a greater molecular mass than water, water is a liquid at room temperature while carbon dioxide is a gas because of the strong intermolecular \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 forces that hold water molecules together. Primarily, it is water's hydrogen bonds that keep it liquid at room temperature.\n[8] If the solvent is a solid, then gases, liquids and solids can be dissolved. 1 Gas in solids: 2 Hydrogen dissolves rather well in metals, especially in palladium; this is studied as a means of hydrogen storage.3 Liquid in solid: 4 Mercury in gold, forming an amalgam. 5 Water in solid salt or sugar, forming moist solids. 6 Hexane in paraffin wax. 7 Solid in 8 ... Sf the solvent is a solid, then gases, liquids and solids can be dissolved. 1 Gas in solids: 2 Hydrogen dissolves rather well in metals, especially in palladium; this is studied as a means of hydrogen storage.\n[9] The hydrogen bond length of water varies with temperature and pressure. As the covalent bond lengths vary much less with temperature and pressure, most of the densification of ice I h due to reduced temperature or increased pressure must be due to reduction in the hydrogen bond length.uch cooperativity is a fundamental property of liquid water where hydrogen bonds are up to 250% stronger than the single hydrogen bond in the dimer [ 77 ]. A strong base at the end of a chain may strengthen the bonding further.\n[10] Liquid water is exceptional in having approximately as many hydrogen bonds as it has covalent bonds. Shown right is the number of hydrogen bonds per water molecule as the temperature rises with the line-width showing the approximate disparity between different experimental methods (data from [ 2264 ]).uch cooperativity is a fundamental property of liquid water where hydrogen bonds are up to 250% stronger than the single hydrogen bond in the dimer [ 77 ].

However, none of these can hydrogen bond, and that is why they are gases, whereas water is a liquid. Of course, at high temperatures water is a gas (steam) and at low temperatures water is a solid (ice). See the Web Links for more information about intermolecular forces. Why is water at room temperature a liquid?\n[6] If natural gas smells like rotten eggs then it contains H2S or hydrogen sulfide.

Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil is Vegetable Oil which has been hydrogenated to make it solid at room temperature. This can then been used to make spreads and margarines. Hydrogenation Process: Vegetable seeds are cleaned and bleached to remove all colour, taste, smells and impurities.\n[8] Liquid hydrogen or slush hydrogen may be used, as in the Space Shuttle. However liquid hydrogen requires cryogenic storage and boils around 20.268 K (\u00e2\u0088\u0092252.882 \u00c2\u00b0C or \u00e2\u0088\u0092423.188 \u00c2\u00b0F). Hence, its liquefaction imposes a large energy loss (as energy is needed to cool it down to that temperature).\n[9] Transferring Liquid. Two persons should be present when liquid hydrogen is being used or transferred, or a container is moved. This does not apply where specially trained employees of the liquid hydrogen supplier, who routinely handle liquid hydrogen, are involved. Hydrogen is normally vaporized and used as a gas.\n[10] Hydrogen fluoride is a chemical compound with the chemical formula HF. This colorless gas or liquid is the principal industrial source of fluorine, often in the aqueous form as hydrofluoric acid, and thus is the precursor to many important compounds including pharmaceuticals and polymers (e.g. Teflon).F is widely used in the petrochemical industry and is a component of many superacids. Hydrogen fluoride boils near room temperature, while other hydrogen halides evaporate at much lower temperatures. Unlike other hydrogen halides, HF is lighter than air and diffuses relatively quickly through porous substances.\n[11] Hydrogen is found naturally in the molecular H2 form.

However, for hydrogen to be in a fully liquid state without boiling at atmospheric pressure, it needs to be cooled to 20.28 K (\u00e2\u0088\u0092423.17 \u00c2\u00b0F/\u00e2\u0088\u0092252.87 \u00c2\u00b0C).\n[12] Confidence votes 11.4K. At STP (standard temperature and pressure) hydrogen is a gas. It cools to a liquid at -423 \u00c2\u00b0F, which is only about 37 degrees above absolute zero.

However liquid hydrogen requires cryogenic storage and boils around 20.268 K (\u00e2\u0088\u0092252.882 \u00c2\u00b0C or \u00e2\u0088\u0092423.188 \u00c2\u00b0F). Hence, its liquefaction imposes a large energy loss (as energy is needed to cool it down to that temperature).\n[16] Saturated fats are solid at room temperature, while unsaturated fats are liquid at room temperature. This is because saturated and unsaturated fats differ in their chemical structures. Saturated fats have no double bond between molecules, which means there are no gaps and the fat is saturated with hydrogen molecules.aturated fats are solid at room temperature, while unsaturated fats are liquid at room temperature. This is because saturated and unsaturated fats differ in their chemical structures. Saturated fats have no double bond between molecules, which means there are no gaps and the fat is saturated with hydrogen molecules.\n[17] Trans fat (also called trans fatty acid) is created when unsaturated fats are hydrogenated (combined with hydrogen), a chemical process that causes fats that would normally be liquid at room temperature to become solid. American Heart Association-Stroke Association answered. Trans fats, also called trans fatty acids, are a type of fat formed when liquid vegetable oils go through a chemical process in which hydrogen is added to make the oils more solid.\n[18] A small number of plant fats are also naturally solid or semisolid at room temperature. Plant fats that are usually liquid at room temperature can be transformed into a solid fat if they undergo a process called hydrogenation in which hydrogen is added to the plant oil.\n[19] Entry 2: Vegetable Oils are usually liquids at room temperature. Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil is Vegetable Oil which has been hydrogenated to make it solid at room temperature. This can then been used to make spreads and margarines. Hydrogenation Process: Vegetable seeds are cleaned and bleached to remove all colour, taste, smells and impurities.\n[20] The liquid vegetable oil is then heated to high temperatures and a catalyst (commonly nickel, but could be palladium, platinum or rhodium) is added. Hydrogen is bubbled through the liquid. The mixture is then filtered to remove the metal, leaving hydrogenated vegetable oil.\nSearch Query: hydrogen is a liquid below what temperature.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Kamerlingh Onnes worked for many years to liquify the element which persisted as a gas to the lowest temperature. Using liquid air to produce liquid hydrogen and then the hydrogen to jacket the liquification apparatus, he produced about 60 cubic centimeters of liquid helium on July 10, 1908.\n[2] Give a reason for the fact that water, the hydride of oxygen, is a liquid at room temperature while the hydride of sulfur (the next member of Group 16) is a gas? (1.) Hydrogen fluoride is a liquid at room temperature and a weak acid but hydrogen chloride is a gas and a strong acid. Explain these facts. (2.) For similar reasons water and ammonia have unexpected properties.\n[3] The composition of Jupiter's atmosphere is similar to that of the sun\u00e2\u0080\u0094mostly hydrogen and helium. Deep in the atmosphere, the pressure and temperature increase, compressing the hydrogen gas into a liquid.At depths about a third of the way down, the hydrogen becomes metallic and electrically conducting.he composition of Jupiter's atmosphere is similar to that of the sun\u00e2\u0080\u0094mostly hydrogen and helium. Deep in the atmosphere, the pressure and temperature increase, compressing the hydrogen gas into a liquid. At depths about a third of the way down, the hydrogen becomes metallic and electrically conducting.\n[4] Not all gases are flammable. eg carbon dioxide, nitrogen or helium. Flammable gases are those which react easily with oxygen in the air to cause combustion... such as hydrogen, methane or propane etc. Even flammable liquids are flammable only because they give off a flammable gas at temperatures below. Gasoline evaporates at room temperature into a mixture of flammable gases which are far more flammable than the liquid itself.\n[5] Examples include butane, acetylene, methane and hydrogen. Flammable liquids are identified as liquids that have a flashpoint (minimum temperature needed for the liquid to produce a vapor with enough of a concentration to ignite) below 100 degrees Fahrenheit (F). There is an exception to this definition. If any of the components of the mixture have flashpoints of 100 deg. F or higher, then the material is classified as combustible rather than flammable. Another way to identify flammable liquids is by class. It is important to remember that with flammable liquids that it is the vapor coming off of the liquid that will ignite and burn, not necessarily the liquid itself.\n[6] Hydrogen is the lightest, simplest and most commonly found chemical element in the Universe, making up around 75% of its elemental mass. Hydrogen is found in large amounts in giant gas planets and stars, it plays a key role in powering stars through fusion reactions.Hydrogen is one of two important elements found in water (H 2 O). Each molecule of water is made up of two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom.In 1766, during an acid metal reaction, Henry Cavendish first formally recognized hydrogen.In 1781 he also found that hydrogen produces water when burned.ydrogen can exist as a liquid under high pressure and an extremely low temperature of 20.28 kelvin (\u00e2\u0088\u0092252.87\u00c2\u00b0C, \u00e2\u0088\u0092423.17 \u00c2\u00b0F). Hydrogen is often stored in this way as liquid hydrogen takes up less space than hydrogen in its normal gas form. Liquid hydrogen is also used as a rocket fuel.\n[7] Some chemical and physical properties of the cyanides likely to be involved in an industrial accident or terrorist attack include: Hydrogen cyanide (AC) is a pale blue or colorless liquid below 78\u00c2\u00b0 F and a colorless gas at higher temperatures.\n[8] The gas cools and loses energy which forces the particles-hydrogen and oxygen in the case of water-to change state from a gas to a liquid. Liquid to Solid: When water as a liquid turns to water as a solid (ice) it goes through the process of freezing. The liquid cools below the freezing point and loses energy.\n[9] Hydrogen cyanide is a colorless or pale-blue liquid at room temperature. It is very volatile, readily producing flammable and toxic concentrations at room temperature. Hydrogen cyanide gas mixes well with air, and explosive mixtures are easily formed.\n[10] Sunflower oil is also sometimes hydrogenated, a process by which hydrogen is added to oils to change their texture. The chemical process of hydrogenation produces saturated fats, while partial hydrogenation produces trans fats. In both cases, hydrogenation allows liquid oils to stay solid at room temperature.\n[11] Hydrogen is found naturally in the molecular H2 form.

Hence, its liquefaction imposes a large energy loss (as energy is needed to cool it down to that temperature).\n[18] Even though a hydrogen bond is only 5% as strong as a covalent bond, it's enough to stabilize water molecules. Hydrogen bonding causes water to remain liquid over a wide temperature range. Because it takes extra energy to break hydrogen bonds, water has an unusually high heat of vaporization. Water has a much higher boiling point than other hydrides.

Ice melts due to the chemical properties of water. There are more hydrogen bonds between the molecules of ice than in water. Ice begins to melt when its temperature exceeds 0 degrees Celsius and hydrogen bonds between water molecules break.\n[10] A further temperature decrease below the boiling point eventually results in mixtures of liquid and solid hydrogen or slush hydrogen, SLH 2.

Also known as social and physical determinants of health, they impact a wide range of health, functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes. Examples of social determinants include: Availability of resources to meet daily needs, such as educational and job opportunities, living wages, or healthful foods.\n[9] Social determinants of health affect factors that are related to health outcomes. Factors related to health outcomes include: 1 How a person develops during the first few years of life (early childhood development). 2 How much education a persons obtains. 3 Being able to get and keep a job.hese social determinants of health also interact with and influence individual behaviors as well.

The three main gases found in the Earth's air are nitrogen, oxygen and water vapor. A typical volume of air at sea level at 15 degrees Celsius contains approximately 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen and between 1 and 5 percent water vapor.\n[7] This is a false assumption. What is correct, however, is that at certain moments in anyone's life, such as when we are simply at rest and thinking, we may be using only 10 percent of our brains.It turns out though, that we use virtually every part of the brain, and that [most of] the brain is active almost all the time, Gordon adds.Let's put it this way: the brain represents three percent of the body's weight and uses 20 percent of the body's energy..his is a false assumption.

Let's put it this way: the brain represents three percent of the body's weight and uses 20 percent of the body's energy..\n[14] The short answer: No. Here are three reasons why. The 30 percent rule has roots in 1969 public housing regulations, which capped public housing rent at 25 percent of a tenant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s income (it inched up to 30 percent in the early 1980s). Rather than looking at what consumers should be spending on housing, however, the government selected the percentages because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what consumers were spending.\n[15] The vast majority of Americans don't know their credit score -- or even how to find out what it is. A July 2003 survey commissioned by the Consumer Federation of America found that only 2 percent of Americans said they knew their credit score.

Twenty percent of all fresh surface water is in one lake, Lake Baikal in Asia. Another twenty percent (about 5,500 cubic miles (about 23,000 cubic kilometers)) is stored in the Great Lakes. Rivers hold only about 0.006 percent of total freshwater reserves. You can see that life on Earth survives on what is essentially only a drop in the bucket of Earth's total water supply!\n[18] So if you paid $400,000 upfront and lived in the village for 12 years with a three percent DMF fee, you would pay 10 times three percent, or 30 percent of $400,000 ($120,000) as your DMF. In effect, this means your \u00e2\u0080\u0098rent' was $10,000 per year or $190 per week.he benefit is that you know what your weekly expenses are going to be in advance, not only for the next 12 months but well into the distant future. The second cost of living in a village community is the Departure Management Fee (DMF). This is paid when you depart the village so it does not affect your weekly budget.\n[19] While a rose is a rose is a rose, not all fats are the same. There are three kinds of fat -- saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated -- and foods contain a mixture of all three.

Endometriosis is a condition in which the lining of the uterus (endometrium) grows outside the uterus. The lining can attach to the ovaries, fallopian tubes, intestines or other structures in the pelvis. Adenomyosis occurs when tissue from the lining of the uterus grows in the muscle of the uterus. Endometriosis may cause pelvic pain, especially during menstruation. Hormones of the menstrual cycle cause the endometriosis to bleed each month. This can be painful and result in the formation of pelvic adhesions, also known as scar tissue.\n[18] Causes Of Abdominal Pain In Women.

Untreated PID can result in long term complications including infertility, ectopic pregnancy, chronic pelvic pain, and cancer.\n[9] Abdominal pain. Appendicitis usually involves a gradual onset of dull, cramping, or aching pain throughout the abdomen. As the appendix becomes more swollen and inflamed, it will irritate the lining of the abdominal wall, known as the peritoneum. This causes localized, sharp pain in the right lower part of the abdomen. The pain tends to be more constant and severe than the dull, aching pain that occurs when symptoms start. However, some people may have an appendix that lies behind the colon. Appendicitis that occurs in these people can cause lower back pain or pelvic pain. Mild fever. Appendicitis usually causes a fever between 99\u00c2\u00b0F (37.2\u00c2\u00b0C) and 100.5\u00c2\u00b0F (38\u00c2\u00b0C). You may also have the chills.

It is amazing how many causes of chronic pelvic pain there are; infection, endometriosis, pelvic muscle imbalances, gastrointestinal causes, joint pathology, etc. There are literally dozens of causes of chronic pain in this region. One of the rarer causes of chronic pelvic and genital pain is a disease called Pudendal Neuralgia. I have treated many patients over the past few years with this diagnosis, and it has been professionally rewarding for me.\n[7] Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of a woman's pelvic organs. The pelvic organs include the uterus (womb), fallopian (fuh-LOH-pee-uhn) tubes (tubes), ovaries, and cervix. Young, sexually active women with multiple sex partners are at greatest risk for pelvic inflammatory disease. 2 Pelvic inflammatory disease many not produce any symptoms. 3 In other cases it can cause fever, abdominal or pelvic pain, vaginal discharge, painful urination, or painful sexual intercourse.\n[8] Adhesions and Chronic Pelvic Pain (CPP). ADHESIONS are believed to cause pelvic pain by tethering down organs and tissues, causing traction (pulling) of nerves. Nerve endings may become entrapped within a developing adhesion. If the bowel becomes obstructed, distention will cause pain. Some patients in whom chronic pelvic pain has lasted more than six months may develop Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome. In addition to the chronic pain, emotional and behavioral changes appear due to the duration of the pain and its associated stress.\n[9] Abdominal pain can occur in one very small specific area, such as the right lower area of the abdomen with appendicitis. Abdominal pain can also be more diffuse and spread throughout the abdomen. Crampy abdominal pain in the pelvic area can be a symptom of menstrual cramps or endometriosis.

Signs and symptoms, when present may include lower abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, fever, burning with urination, pain with sex, or irregular menstruation. Untreated PID can result in long term complications including infertility, ectopic pregnancy, chronic pelvic pain, and cancer.\n[18] Abdominal pain. Appendicitis usually involves a gradual onset of dull, cramping, or aching pain throughout the abdomen. As the appendix becomes more swollen and inflamed, it will irritate the lining of the abdominal wall, known as the peritoneum. This causes localized, sharp pain in the right lower part of the abdomen. The pain tends to be more constant and severe than the dull, aching pain that occurs when symptoms start. However, some people may have an appendix that lies behind the colon. Appendicitis that occurs in these people can cause lower back pain or pelvic pain. Mild fever. Appendicitis usually causes a fever between 99\u00c2\u00b0F (37.2\u00c2\u00b0C) and 100.5\u00c2\u00b0F (38\u00c2\u00b0C). You may also have the chills. If your appendix bursts, the resulting infection could cause your fever to rise.\n[19] Symptoms of pelvic pain can occur along with other symptoms, depending upon the exact cause. Associated symptoms can include low back pain, vaginal or urethral bleeding or discharge, fever, and pain during sex. Endometriosis is a common cause of pelvic pain in women that can cause heavy menstrual bleeding as well as pain during or after sex.

In addition to the chronic pain, emotional and behavioral changes appear due to the duration of the pain and its associated stress.\n[19] Abdominal pain can occur in one very small specific area, such as the right lower area of the abdomen with appendicitis. Abdominal pain can also be more diffuse and spread throughout the abdomen. Crampy abdominal pain in the pelvic area can be a symptom of menstrual cramps or endometriosis.

There are some impressive statistics to back this up, too. A shark can sniff out fish extracts that make up only one part for every 10 billion parts [source: Elasmodiver]. Other research shows sharks are able to respond to one part blood for every one million parts of water; this is like being able to smell one teaspoon of something in a swimming pool [source: Shark Trust]. What's more, sharks can smell these small amounts from hundreds of meters away [source: SeaWorld].\n[2] Sharks have nostrils that they only use to smell. When they swim, water flows through the nostrils, is introduced into the nasal duct and moves the last folds of the skin that has sensory cells. Some sharks, such as the lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostris), can detect a small amount of blood in the water.\n[3] Most large sharks are cold-blooded and cruise at a leisurely 1.5 mph. Because most species fare poorly in captivity, the maximum swimming speed of a shark has seldom been measured. The Blue Shark is an open ocean glider, planing on wing-like pectoral fins and flattened belly.\n[4] The shark is a meat-eating fish and one of the most feared animals in the sea. There are over 300 types of sharks that live in oceans all over the world. Most of them live in warm seas but some sharks prefer colder regions like the seas around Antarctica. The first sharks lived in our oceans about 300 million years ago.\n[5] (How Long Do Sharks Live) Many sharks can live for about 20 to 30 years, with some species are known to live a fairly longer life. The lifespans of large sharks are greater than that of the smaller sharks. Great white shark reaches its maturity at the age of 15 and it has the lifespan of 25 to 30 years.\n[6] (How Long Do Sharks Live). Many sharks can live for about 20 to 30 years, with some species are known to live a fairly longer life. The lifespans of large sharks are greater than that of the smaller sharks. Great white shark reaches its maturity at the age of 15 and it has the lifespan of 25 to 30 years.\n[7] MYTH: The Great White is a common shark found off beaches visited by humans. FACT: Great Whites are relatively uncommon large predators that prefer cooler waters. In some parts of their range, great whites are close to being endangered. MYTH: Whale sharks, the largest species of sharks, are voracious predators. FACT: Whale sharks, which are the largest fish that ever lived, are plankton feeders like the great whales, thus the name. A reef shark on the prowl is seldom a target for anglers.\n[8] Sharks like the great white can smell blood up to 3 miles away. According to National Geographic, sharks can smell one drop of blood in 25 gallons of water, 3 miles away.\n[9] The name bull shark comes from the shark's stocky shape, broad, flat snout, and aggressive, unpredictable behavior. In India, the bull shark may be confused with the Sundarbans or Ganges shark. In Africa, it is also commonly called the Zambezi River shark or just Zambi.he bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas), also known as the Zambezi shark or, unofficially, as Zambi in Africa and Nicaragua shark in Nicaragua, is a requiem shark commonly found worldwide in warm, shallow waters along coasts and in rivers.\n[10] These sharks are unique in their ability to elevate and maintain body temperatures as much as 13 C above the ambient water temperature. One striking feature of these warm-bodied sharks is that their flanks and viscera are warm, while the heart and gills are at environmental temperatures.\n[11] The bull shark, also known as the whaler shark, Zambezi shark or unofficially known as Zambi in Africa and Nicaragua shark in Nicaragua, is a shark common worldwide in warm, s\u00e2\u0080\u00a6hallow waters along coasts and in rivers. The bull shark is well known for its unpredictable, often aggressive behavior.\n[12] 1) that sharks attack surfers because of 'mistaken identification' 2)that sharks are man eaters and are out to get us 3)that a shark can tow away a boat 4)dogs attract sharks \u00e2\u0080\u00a65)sharks can detect a pin head amount of blood from up to mile away.\n[13] The gills are crucial to a sharks breathing system. By opening its mouth, water is drawn into the shark. The open mouth gives the appearance of a smile in many sharks. When a shark closes its mouth, the water is forced over its gills and the tiny blood vessels in shark gills absorb oxygen from the water.\n[14] Bull shark. The bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas), also known as the Zambezi shark or, unofficially, as Zambi in Africa and Nicaragua shark in Nicaragua, is a requiem shark commonly found worldwide in warm, shallow waters along coasts and in rivers.\n[15] The bull shark, also known as the Zambezi shark in Africa, and Lake Nicaragua shark in Nicaragua, is a requiem shark commonly found worldwide in warm, shallow waters along coasts and in rivers. The bull shark is known for its aggressive nature, predilection for warm shallow water, and presence in brackish and freshwater systems including estuaries and rivers. Bull sharks can thrive in both salt and fresh water and can travel far up rivers. They have been known to travel up the Mississippi River as far as Alton, Illinois, about 700 miles (1100 km) from the ocean.\n[16] Bull shark. The bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas), also known as the Zambezi shark or, unofficially, as Zambi in Africa and Lake Nicaragua shark in Nicaragua, is a requiem shark commonly found worldwide in warm, shallow waters along coasts and in rivers.\n[17] Shark bites occur more frequently in murky water. They are attracted by lights, noise, or splashing, and smell. For theses reasons surface swimming should be kept to a minimum, in shark waters. Research shows that bright colors attract sharks more than dark objects, so it is better for divers to wear dark colors. Blood in the water can attract sharks from long distances. They can sense blood in the water in concentrations as little as 4 parts per million.\n[18] Blood and human waste attract sharks. 6. Sharks are creatures of habit. Do not swim in areas where a shark attack has recently occurred, since the same shark, or others, may still frequent the spot. 5. Try to swim on sunny, clear days. Foggy mornings and dusk may cause a shark to confuse you with prey.\n[19] The red tail shark will be compatible with such fish as gouramis, barbs, danios, rainbows, bala sharks, iridescent sharks, red finned cigar sharks, pictus catfish, swordtails, silver dollars, angels, most loaches and even some types of cichlids.hile the body of this fish is black, the tail of this shark is a striking, bright red. In some cases, the red tail shark's black dorsal and pectoral fins may even be tipped with white. Usually, these white tips will fade as the fish matures, as most of these white tipped red tail sharks are juveniles.\n[20] Shark size varies according to the species. The largest shark is the whale shark which is up to 41 feet long. The great white shark is up to 20 feet long. Bull sharks can reach up to 11 feet.Tiger sharks can measure between 10 to 14 feet.he largest shark is the whale shark which is up to 41 feet long. The great white shark is up to 20 feet long.

The Bull Shark is found in tropical and subtropical seas around the world, and prefers warm waters. It also lives very close inshore, and often enters fresh water for long periods.\n[4] Not to be confused with whitetip reef shark.

The largest specimen ever caught measured 4 m (13 ft), an exceptionally large size considering few specimens are known to exceed a length of 3 m (9.8 ft). The maximum reported weight is 170 kg (370 lb).\n[5] It depends.

Bull sharks can thrive in both salt and fresh water and can travel far up rivers. They have been known to travel up the Mississippi River as far as Alton, Illinois, although few freshwater human-shark interactions have been recorded.\n[8] Blue sharks eat a significant amount of squid, while tiger sharks are known to eat sea turtles. Smooth dogfish sharks eat crabs and lobsters, and hammerhead sharks prefer stingrays. Some sharks that are quick and large enough also hunt sea mammals. Great white sharks, tiger sharks and mako sharks have been known to eat sea lions, seals, dolphins, porpoises and sea birds. They also prey on large fish like mackerel and tuna. The largest shark, the whale shark, doesn't hunt for its food.\n[9] The scientists found growth rate to be a good indicator of metabolic rates in living animals, ranging from sharks to birds. In general, warm-blooded mammals that grow about 10 times faster than cold-blooded reptiles also metabolize about 10 times faster. Comparative growth rates in vertebrates. Dinosaurs grew intermediate to endothermic mammals and birds and ectothermic reptiles and fish, but closest to living mesotherms.\n[10] Tiger sharks (pictured) are among the 17 species that appear to lack color vision.

Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: how are some sharks warm blooded.\n\n[1] White Shark Diving: White Shark Ventures invites you cage diving with great white sharks in the aptly named Shark Alley , near the fishing village of Gansbaai, South Africa. Sharks are quite possibly the world's most feared animals. From the smallest sand shark to the enormous whale shark, they are sleek, muscled, and some are almost as agile as a dolphin. There is no doubt that they are the most evolved predators in the ocean.\n[2] Research shows that sharks are capable of responding to one part blood for every 10 billion parts water, essentially a tea spoon of blood in a swimming pool; but, not probably not an Olympic sized swimming pool. Sharks can smell 10,000x better than humans. But, according to LiveScience (Shark Smell Myth Found Fishy ) and Floridian researchers, the smelling capacity of sharks based on the volume of blood and/or amino acids in a volume of water does not greatly exceed that of other fish species.\n[3] It is unknown how long whale sharks can live, however, scientists believe they can live approximately 60-100 years. Whale sharks are found in all tropical and warm-temperate seas around the world, preferring water temperatures of 20-25\u00c2\u00b0C.\n[4] Growing up watching Jaws and fictional shark based stories, I recalled some scenes from the movie that sharks target wounded people who were swimming or in the water. I'm just really curious if they(sharks) actually are attracted to the smell of blood.\n[5] Sharks are attracted to blood and smelly farts. If there is ever a shark attach try not to poop alot because that will attract more sharks because of shark sugar.\n[6] Nothing to Turn Your Nose Up At. The notion that the mighty great white can smell blood from a great distance has been central to modern shark mythology. Indeed, sharks do possess some of the most amazing olfactory capabilities in the natural world. Smell is so vital to a shark that two-thirds of its brain is devoted to it. They can detect some scents at concentrations as low as 1 part per 25 million, which translates to about a third of a mile away in the open ocean.\n[7] How Long Do Great White Sharks Live. Many sharks can live for about 20 to 30 years, with some species are known to live a fairly longer life. The lifespans of large sharks are greater than that of the smaller sharks. Great white shark reaches its maturity at the age of 15 and it has the lifespan of 25 to 30 years.\n[8] The bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas), also known as the Zambezi shark or, unofficially, as Zambi in Africa and Nicaragua shark in Nicaragua, is a requiem shark commonly found worldwide in warm, shallow waters along coasts and in rivers.he bull shark is known for its aggressive nature, predilection for warm shallow water, and presence in brackish and freshwater systems including estuaries and rivers. Bull sharks can thrive in both saltwater and freshwater and can travel far up rivers.\n[9] Interesting facts and questions about sharks. How Big Is The Biggest Recorded Whale Shark? Answer: The Guinness Book of Records has the World\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Largest fish (a Whale Shark) registered as 12.65 meters which are 41 feet 6 inches. However, there are versions that whale sharks could reach up to 60 feet, but this is not confirmed. Links to other pages in this site. Where Do Tiger Sharks Live? How Do Sharks Breed? What To Do If A Shark Of The Atlantic Attack? How Do Sharks Communicate? Why Do Sharks Have Cartilage?\n[10] How big can sharks grow? Sharks come in a range of sizes. The largest shark known is the whale shark, which reaches lengths of 12 metres (almost 40 feet) or more. The smallest shark, the dwarf shark, is only 25 cm (10 inches) long. The basking shark is the largest shark in Atlantic Canada, routinely reaching lengths of 8-9 metres. The largest confirmed great white shark caught in Canada was more than 5 metres long.\n[11] These sharks are unique in their ability to elevate and maintain body temperatures as much as 13 C above the ambient water temperature. One striking feature of these warm-bodied sharks is that their flanks and viscera are warm, while the heart and gills are at environmental temperatures.\n[12] Caribbean Reef Shark: This is the most commonly seen shark in the Caribbean. It is usually 6.5-8 feet, or 2-2.5 meters, long. Look for dusky-colored fins that do not have any prominent markings, as well as a coloration that is dark grey or grey-brown on the top of the body and white or white-yellow underneath.iger Sharks: Another large shark, capable of growing to a length of over 16 feet, or 5 meters, the Tiger Shark can be found in the Caribbean and other warm waters around the world.\n[13] The bull shark, also known as the Zambezi shark in Africa, and Lake Nicaragua shark in Nicaragua, is a requiem shark commonly found worldwide in warm, shallow waters along coasts and in rivers. The bull shark is known for its aggressive nature, predilection for warm shallow water, and presence in brackish and freshwater systems including estuaries and rivers. Bull sharks can thrive in both salt and fresh water and can travel far up rivers. They have been known to travel up the Mississippi River as far as Alton, Illinois, although few freshwater human-shark interactions have been recorded.\n[14] Many scientists agree that since bull sharks often dwell in shallow waters, they may be more dangerous to humans than any other species of shark, and that they, tiger sharks and great white sharks are the three shark species most likely to attack humans.onfidence votes 28. The Bull Shark is found in tropical and subtropical seas around the world, and prefers warm waters. It also lives very close inshore, and often enters fresh water for long periods.\n[15] Sharks like the great white can smell blood up to 3 miles away. According to National Geographic, sharks can smell one drop of blood in 25 gallons of water, 3 miles away.\n[16] Smell is probably the most important shark sense, so much so that sharks have been referred to as swimming noses [source: SeaWorld]. There are some impressive statistics to back this up, too. A shark can sniff out fish extracts that make up only one part for every 10 billion parts [source: Elasmodiver]. Other research shows sharks are able to respond to one part blood for every one million parts of water; this is like being able to smell one teaspoon of something in a swimming pool [source: Shark Trust]. What's more, sharks can smell these small amounts from hundreds of meters away [source: SeaWorld].\n[17] Sharks have nostrils that they only use to smell. When they swim, water flows through the nostrils, is introduced into the nasal duct and moves the last folds of the skin that has sensory cells. Some sharks, such as the lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostris), can detect a small amount of blood in the water.\n[18] The gills are crucial to a sharks breathing system. By opening its mouth, water is drawn into the shark. The open mouth gives the appearance of a smile in many sharks. When a shark closes its mouth, the water is forced over its gills and the tiny blood vessels in shark gills absorb oxygen from the water.\n[19] The name bull shark comes from the shark's stocky shape, broad, flat snout, and aggressive, unpredictable behavior. In India, the bull shark may be confused with the Sundarbans or Ganges shark. In Africa, it is also commonly called the Zambezi River shark or just Zambi.he bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas), also known as the Zambezi shark or, unofficially, as Zambi in Africa and Nicaragua shark in Nicaragua, is a requiem shark commonly found worldwide in warm, shallow waters along coasts and in rivers.\n[20] Bull shark.

Most of the time if there is a shark attack a helicopter will come to assist but the helicopter will not attract more sharks to come.\n[6] Tiger sharks (pictured) are among the 17 species that appear to lack color vision. Sharks may be able to smell blood from miles away, but they probably don't know how red it is: New research suggests sharks are color-blind.\n[7] Because of these characteristics, many experts consider bull sharks to be the most dangerous sharks in the world. Historically, they are joined by their more famous cousins, great whites and tiger sharks, as the three species most likely to attack humans. Bull sharks get their name from their short, blunt snout, as well as their pugnacious disposition and a tendency to head-butt their prey before attacking. They are medium-size sharks, with thick, stout bodies and long pectoral fins. They are gray on top and white below, and the fins have dark tips, particularly on young bull sharks. They are found cruising the shallow, warm waters of all the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s oceans. Fast, agile predators, they will eat almost anything they see, including fish, dolphins, and even other sharks.\n[8] Whale Shark. The Whale Shark is the largest and the heaviest living shark because its weight is more than 21 tons and its length is more than 12 meter. It is found in open oceans and warm waters. It feeds on plankton but some times it also uses other small fishes as food. It is not facing any serious threat of extinction as they are found in large numbers.\n[9] Large sharks that living in temperate waters include the great white shark, the shortfin mako shark, and the basking shark. These large temperate sharks can generate their own body heat and are therefore able to travel farther than smaller temperate sharks, which cannot.lthough large temperate sharks will travel into tropical waters, they will swim only at depths where the temperature is in their preferred range. Smaller sharks are much more affected by heat and cold and stay within their limits. Sandbar sharks like water temperature between about 15\u00c2\u00b0-30\u00c2\u00b0C (59&deg-86&degF).\n[10] Bull Sharks Are Found All Over The World. Bull sharks are found the world over in just about every place a shark might typically live, and even some where most sharks can't. They like tropical and warm temperate areas, but will make seasonal forays into cool, temperate waters.\n[11] These sharks are unique in their ability to elevate and maintain body temperatures as much as 13 C above the ambient water temperature.

Most sharks can detect blood and animal odors from many miles away. Another amazing thing about a shark's sense of smell is that it's directional. The twin nasal cavities act something like your two ears: Smell coming from the left of the shark will arrive at the left cavity just before it arrives at the right cavity. In this way, a shark can figure out where a smell is coming from and head in that direction. Sharks also have a very acute sense of hearing.\n[8] While most sharks prefer warm or temperate water, one shark is built to withstand extreme cold. The Greenland shark lives in the northernmost waters of any shark \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the icy seas of the Arctic Circle, where water temperatures can drop to 30\u00c2\u00b0 Fahrenheit.\n[9] Sharks live in every ocean. Sharks swim in every ocean of the world, from warm tropic waters to icy polar. seas. Some live in the deep, dark waters of the ocean, while others bask in sunlit. waters close to the surface. Some prefer the high seas, others live in water closer. to shore. A few sharks even swim up rivers, and at least one species, the bull. shark, is sometimes found in fresh water lakes. 2. All sharks look alike. No, many kinds of sharks which live in the open ocean have torpedo-shaped. bodies.\n[10] How big can great white sharks mouth open? Is Whale Shark a whale or a shark? A whale shark is a shark, the largest living fish in the world, yet it is a filter feeder. Even though it doesnt have the same diet as a shark, it is a shark.\n[11] These sharks are unique in their ability to elevate and maintain body temperatures as much as 13 C above the ambient water temperature. One striking feature of these warm-bodied sharks is that their flanks and viscera are warm, while the heart and gills are at environmental temperatures.\n[12] The bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas), also known as the Zambezi shark or, unofficially, as Zambi in Africa and Nicaragua shark in Nicaragua, is a requiem shark commonly found worldwide in warm, shallow waters along coasts and in rivers.he bull shark is a special case in evolutionary history. Some of its closest living relatives do not have the capabilities of osmoregulation. The bull shark's genus, Carcharhinus, is shared by the sand bar shark that is not capable of osmoregulation.\n[13] How Long Do Great White Sharks Live. Many sharks can live for about 20 to 30 years, with some species are known to live a fairly longer life. The lifespans of large sharks are greater than that of the smaller sharks. Great white shark reaches its maturity at the age of 15 and it has the lifespan of 25 to 30 years. The average lifespan of tiger sharks is 50 years in the wild. (How Long Do Sharks Live) The average lifespan of nurse sharks is 25 years in captivity.\n[14] How Long Do Great White Sharks Live.

The Whale Shark is the largest and the heaviest living shark because its weight is more than 21 tons and its length is more than 12 meter. It is found in open oceans and warm waters. It feeds on plankton but some times it also uses other small fishes as food.\n[16] Tiger Shark \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Galeocerdo cuvier. Tiger sharks are very large and so they require a considerable amount of wide open space. They enjoy warm water so they are found in the tropic areas of the world as well as some sub tropic locations.ating Habits of Tiger Sharks. A tiger shark will eat any type of fish, shark, animal, and small entity it can find in the water. They are very curious by nature and will taste anything that comes their way. The stomachs of tiger sharks have been found with some very unique items inside of them.\n[17] Tiger Sharks: Another large shark, capable of growing to a length of over 16 feet, or 5 meters, the Tiger Shark can be found in the Caribbean and other warm waters around the world.iger Sharks: Another large shark, capable of growing to a length of over 16 feet, or 5 meters, the Tiger Shark can be found in the Caribbean and other warm waters around the world.\n[18] Bull shark Facts. Bull shark is a type of shark that is best known by its aggressive behavior. This fish can be found in warm, shallow waters of all oceans of the world.Bull sharks can survive in brackish water (mixture of salty and fresh water), but they can be also found in the Amazon and Mississippi rivers and in various lakes.ull shark Facts. Bull shark is a type of shark that is best known by its aggressive behavior. This fish can be found in warm, shallow waters of all oceans of the world.\n[19] Because of these characteristics, many experts consider bull sharks to be the most dangerous sharks in the world. Historically, they are joined by their more famous cousins, great whites and tiger sharks, as the three species most likely to attack humans. Bull sharks get their name from their short, blunt snout, as well as their pugnacious disposition and a tendency to head-butt their prey before attacking. They are medium-size sharks, with thick, stout bodies and long pectoral fins. They are gray on top and white below, and the fins have dark tips, particularly on young bull sharks. They are found cruising the shallow, warm waters of all the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s oceans. Fast, agile predators, they will eat almost anything they see, including fish, dolphins, and even other sharks.\n[20] Bull Sharks Are Found All Over The World. Bull sharks are found the world over in just about every place a shark might typically live, and even some where most sharks can't. They like tropical and warm temperate areas, but will make seasonal forays into cool, temperate waters.\nSearch Query: how are some sharks warm blooded.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Beneath the gills are tiny blood vessels that extract oxygen out of the water as it passes over them. Most shark species breathe by swimming with their mouths open which allows the water to pass over the gills. Some sharks like nurse, angel and lemon sharks have strong neck muscles that pump water over the gills, allowing the shark to breathe while resting on the ocean bottom. Sharks are fish, and therefore breathe through the use of\n[2] Myth 5: Sharks Can Detect a Single Drop of Blood in the Ocean! Sharks are often portrayed as having an almost supernatural sense of smell. However, reports that sharks can smell a single drop of blood in a vast ocean are greatly exaggerated. While some sharks can detect blood at one part per million, that hardly qualifies as the entire ocean. Sharks do, however, have an acute sense of smell and a sensitive olfactory system--much more so than humans.\n[3] Sharks Can Detect a Single Drop of Blood in the Ocean!

It is found in open oceans and warm waters. It feeds on plankton but some times it also uses other small fishes as food.\n[5] Powerful Sense of Smell. The strongest sense for a shark is their smell. It is a common myth though that sharks can smell blood miles away and then they will find the person or animal that it is coming from. While sharks can smell blood, it often indicates to them that there is wounded prey they can easily overpower. It may surprise you to learn that the nostrils on a shark aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t used for smelling. In fact, they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even attached to their mouths. It isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t an instinct of killing that the blood is going to create in them. In fact, if they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hungry then they won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even bother to look for the source of the smell. Some of the species though can smell and indicate even a single drop of blood in the water. This is just an example of how powerful their sense of smell really is.\n[6] Oceanic Whitetip Shark. The oceanic whitetip shark, Carcharhinus longimanus, is a large pelagic shark of tropical and warm temperate seas. It is a stocky shark, most notable for its long, white-tipped, rounded fins.ceanic Whitetip Shark.

Great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) are huge and powerful warm-blooded fish that have been around for at least 11 million years. Also known as white pointers, their ancestors existed on Earth 400 million years ago, which is 200 million years before the first dinosaur appeared.\n[11] These sharks are unique in their ability to elevate and maintain body temperatures as much as 13 C above the ambient water temperature.

Best Answer: Whales, seals, dolphins, and otters are mammals (warm blooded creatures that give birth to live young. Some sharks give live birth, some eggs, and some are eggs in the uterus, but are born live. Seals find a nice beach and give birth to their pups there.ut whales, dolphins and otters (I'm supposing it's sea otters you're talking about) give birth in water. Although their babies are born in water and can swim, they need adults to help them to the surface to breathe. As for sharks, most lay eggs, but some do give live birth.\n[14] A great white shark, for example, would be able to detect a single drop of blood in an Olympic-size pool.

Pelagic sharks are shortfin makos and whale sharks. Deep water sharks, such as catsharks, goblin sharks and megamouth sharks, stay in cold water all year round.lthough large temperate sharks will travel into tropical waters, they will swim only at depths where the temperature is in their preferred range. Smaller sharks are much more affected by heat and cold and stay within their limits. Sandbar sharks like water temperature between about 15\u00c2\u00b0-30\u00c2\u00b0C (59&deg-86&degF).\n[19] Sharks live in every ocean.

Some, like the Mako and the Great white shark, are partially warmblooded (they are endotherms). These sharks can raise their temperature about the temperature of the water; they need to have occasional short bursts of speed in hunting.\n[2] More on Warm-Bodied Sharks. Shortfin Mako (Isurus oxyrinchus) A question came across SHARK-L concerning makos being considered warm-blooded and various replies touch upon aspects of the topic. I responded to the original query and went onto expand upon or correct some of those responses.\n[3] White sharks are part of the fish family, so they must be 'cold-blooded', right? Actually, white sharks are much more complex than you may think. An animal that is 'cold-blooded' means their inside body temperature is dependent on the environment they are in. For example, a snake is cold blooded, so its body temperature fluctuates with the day or even whether or not they are in the sun.\n[4] How far can sharks smell blood? A: A great white shark can smell blood in a radius of approximately 1/3 mile or as low as 1 part per 25 million.. Not all sharks have this strong of a sense of smell; however, all sharks do have a sense of smell that is superior to many animals.

A great white shark, for example, would be able to detect a single drop of blood in an Olympic-size pool. Most sharks can detect blood and animal odors from many miles away.\n[6] And I think blue sharks are more aggresive than whale sharks. _ The blue whale is the largest mammal on Earth. The underside of its flippers are almost white, while the rest of its body is blue grey. The average blue whale is 75 to 80 feet long and weigh up to 110 tonnes.Females are larger and can weigh up to 150 tonnes.he Whale Shark, like the Blue Whale, are both filter feeders. Blue Whales (Balaenoptera musculus), on the other hand are class mammalia--- they're mammals, as we are. They are warm blooded, have hair, bear and nurse their young alive. As with all Mysticetes (the sub class), they are filter feeders.\n[7] Answer: The fastest shark is a Mako Shark, the shark can reach a speed of 45 mph.

It depends on the type of shark, most sharks like living in warm or tropical waters,such as Hawaii and Australia.Some sharks though can live in colder waters,such as the Greenland shark and the Great White shark.The Great White Shark has even been seen in the cold waters of Sanfransisco.\n[9] But the advantages of endothermy are costly. To maintain a warm body in cold water, a mackerel shark must burn fuel like a blast furnace. A warm-bodied shark may need more than ten times as much food as a cold-bodied shark of the same size.\n[10] What eats a shark? What do sharks eat? There are many species of sharks, from tiny, two-foot (.75 meter) sand sharks to great white sharks that can reach a length of 20 feet (6.5 meters) or more. Most sharks eat fish, octopi, squid, turtles, and other cold-blooded sea creatures, along with the occasional sea bird caught napping on the water.\n[11] These sharks are unique in their ability to elevate and maintain body temperatures as much as 13 C above the ambient water temperature.

Some species live mainly in cold waters, while some others prefer warmer waters. SHARK MIGRATION. One thing is for sure; sharks migrate to find new sources of food and they can travel up to hundreds of miles to do that. Most species of sharks live in the oceans. However, some of them are known to dwell in bodies of freshwater, like the bull shark which travels up to 4,000 Km up the Amazon River. Sometimes, sharks reach freshwater bodies; this could be the result of the destruction of their habitat by human activities.\n[7] Sharks' blood gives them turbo speed. Several species of shark and tuna have something special going on inside their bodies. For a long time, scientists have known that some fish species appear warm-blooded. Salmon sharks can elevate their body temperatures by up to 20 degrees compared to the surrounding water, for example.\n[8] Great white sharks are some of the only warm blooded sharks. This allows them to swim in colder waters in addition to warm, tropical waters. Great White sharks can be found as\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 north as Alaska and as south as the southern tip of South America. They exist worldwide, everywhere in-between. 5 people found this useful.\n[9] Some fish are ectothermic such as the Blue shark whereas others are endothermic such as swordfish and Lamnid sharks.ndothermic = warm-blooded Ectothermic = cold-blooded Endotherms are able to maintain their own body temperature, whereas Ectotherms rely on their environment to regulate body \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 temperature.\n[10] For many people, sharks are the epitome of the 'cold-blooded killer'. The warm-bodied mackerel sharks are spectacular reminders that many of our stereotypes are inaccurate.

I responded to the original query and went onto expand upon or correct some of those responses.\n[13] White sharks are part of the fish family, so they must be 'cold-blooded', right? Actually, white sharks are much more complex than you may think. An animal that is 'cold-blooded' means their inside body temperature is dependent on the environment they are in. For example, a snake is cold blooded, so its body temperature fluctuates with the day or even whether or not they are in the sun.\n[14] These sharks are unique in their ability to elevate and maintain body temperatures as much as 13 C above the ambient water temperature. One striking feature of these warm-bodied sharks is that their flanks and viscera are warm, while the heart and gills are at environmental temperatures.\n[15] While most sharks prefer warm or temperate water, one shark is built to withstand extreme cold. The Greenland shark lives in the northernmost waters of any shark \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the icy seas of the Arctic Circle, where water temperatures can drop to 30\u00c2\u00b0 Fahrenheit.\n[16] In some sharks, these sensitive cells can detect even the slightest traces of blood in the water. A great white shark, for example, would be able to detect a single drop of blood in an Olympic-size pool. Most sharks can detect blood and animal odors from many miles away.\n[17] Powerful Sense of Smell. The strongest sense for a shark is their smell. It is a common myth though that sharks can smell blood miles away and then they will find the person or animal that it is coming from. While sharks can smell blood, it often indicates to them that there is wounded prey they can easily overpower. It may surprise you to learn that the nostrils on a shark aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t used for smelling. In fact, they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even attached to their mouths. It isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t an instinct of killing that the blood is going to create in them. In fact, if they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hungry then they won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even bother to look for the source of the smell. Some of the species though can smell and indicate even a single drop of blood in the water. This is just an example of how powerful their sense of smell really is.\n[18] A great white shark, for example, would be able to detect a single drop of blood in an Olympic-size pool. Most sharks can detect blood and animal odors from many miles away. Another amazing thing about a shark's sense of smell is that it's directional. The twin nasal cavities act something like your two ears: Smell coming from the left of the shark will arrive at the left cavity just before it arrives at the right cavity. In this way, a shark can figure out where a smell is coming from and head in that direction. Sharks also have a very acute sense of hearing.\n[19] HOW DO SHARKS BREATHE? Beneath the gills are tiny blood vessels that extract oxygen out of the water as it passes over them. Most shark species breathe by swimming with their mouths open which allows the water to pass over the gills. Some sharks like nurse, angel and lemon sharks have strong neck muscles that pump water over the gills, allowing the shark to breathe while resting on the ocean bottom. Sharks are fish, and therefore breathe through the use of\n[20] What eats a shark? What do sharks eat? There are many species of sharks, from tiny, two-foot (.75 meter) sand sharks to great white sharks that can reach a length of 20 feet (6.5 meters) or more. Most sharks eat fish, octopi, squid, turtles, and other cold-blooded sea creatures, along with the occasional sea bird caught napping on the water.\nSearch Query: how are some sharks warm blooded.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

A trapezoid is a quadrilateral -- a four sided shape -- with two parallel sides, called bases, of unequal length. You can find the area of a trapezoid using the lengths of these two sides, and the distance between the two sides, called the height.If you don't know a trapezoid's height, solve for it using the Pythagorean Theorem and length of the trapezoid's diagonals, the two sides that connect its bases.rea, A, is given by the lengths of the two bases, b1 and b2, divided by 2 and multiplied by the trapezoid's height, h, as follows: A = (b1 + b2) / 2 x h. Take a trapezoid whose bases are 4 and 6 inches long and which is 2 inches high.\n[11] trapezoid, closed plane figure bounded by four line segments, or sides, two of which are parallel and two of which are nonparallel. The parallel sides of a trapezoid are called bases and the nonparallel sides legs; in an isosceles trapezoid the legs are of equal length. The median of a trapezoid is the line segment connecting the midpoints of the legs; it is parallel to the bases and equal to half the sum of their lengths.\n[12] Let's begin studying the area of a trapezoid. The area of a trapezoid is equal to one half the height multiplied by the sum of the lengths of the bases. It is expressed as. where A is the area of the trapezoid, h is the height, and b1 and b2 are the lengths of the two bases. The bases and height of the trapezoid are required in order to determine its area. Let's work on two exercises that will help us apply this area formula to trapezoids. Exercise 1.

Explanation: A midsegment of a trapezoid is a segment that connects the midpoints of the two non-parallel sides of a trapezoid. This segment has two special properties. It is parallel to the bases of the trapezoid. The length of the midsegment is the average of the lengths of the two bases. Remember that the bases of a trapezoid are parallel. Key Curriculum Press can provide demo versions of Geometer's Sketch Pad.\n[2] The midsegment of a trapezoid is the segment that joins the midpoints of the nonparallel sides of a trapezoid.

The most important thing to remember is that a midpoint bisects a line (cuts a line into two equal halves). The midsegment of a trapezoid is the segment that joins the midpoints of the nonparallel sides of a trapezoid. In the trapezoid below, the midpoints of the non-parallel sides are points S and V.

The length of the midsegment is the sum of the two bases divided by 2. Remember that the bases of a trapezoid are the two parallel sides. To find angles within a trapezoid, remember that since there are two sides are parallel, the other sides can be seen as transversals, forming corresponding angles and same side interior angles.\n[6] The midsegment of a trapezoid has two special properties: 1 The midsegment of a trapezoid is parallel to each base. 2 The length of the midsegment of a trapezoid is equal to half the sum of the lengths of its bases.\n[7] The midsegment of a trapezoid is referred to as the median or the midline. The length of the midsegment is calculated by finding the average length of each of the parallel sides. The formula for this length is the sum of the length of side A plus the length of side B, divided by two. The midsegment is also used to calculate the area of a trapezoid. Learn more about Shapes.\n[8] The midsegment (also called the median or midline) of a trapezoid is the segment that joins the midpoints of the legs. It is parallel to the bases. Its length m is equal to the average of the lengths of the bases a and b of the trapezoid, The midsegment of a trapezoid is one of the two bimedians (the other bimedian divides the trapezoid into equal areas). The height (or altitude) is the perpendicular distance between the bases.\n[9] The side of the triangle that the midsegment does not intersect is the base of the triangle. The midsegment of a trapezoid is the segment formed by connecting the midpoints of the two legs of a trapezoid. Although the midsegment of a trapezoid is also useful in mathematics, we will not discuss it here.\n[10] This segment's length is always equal to one-half the sum of the trapezoid's bases, or. Consider trapezoid ABCD shown below. The midsegment, EF, which is shown in red, has a length of. The measurement of the midsegment is only dependent on the length of the trapezoid's bases.\n[11] In the trapezoid below, the midpoints of the non-parallel sides are points S and V.

Rank the passages based on their relevance to the search query: difference between a mcdouble and a double cheeseburger.\n\n[1] There is a discernible difference between the two burgers, especially in the meat quality. The McDouble contains gristle and carry's a different flavor than the Double Cheeseburger. The double cheeseburger tastes more like beef. The McDouble tastes of whatever meat filler they use to fill the gap.\n[2] At first glance, the double cheeseburger looks a lot like the McDouble, but it is not exactly the same thing. The main difference that you will notice is the amount of cheese that is on this sandwich. There are two slices of cheese on the double cheeseburger instead of just the one slice of cheese that comes on the McDouble. Even though it comes with two slices of cheese, it still has the onions, pickles, ketchup and mustard that come on the other burgers.\n[3] But I did it for you. With McDonald's recent release of the McDouble, they now have three basic, sub-$2 cheeseburgers: the cheeseburger, McDouble (two patties with one slice of cheese), and double cheeseburger (two patties with two slices of cheese).\n[4] Although we previously reported that the McDouble would be on the Dollar Menu, in Manhattan the cheeseburger appears on the Dollar Menu while the McDouble is $1.39 and the double cheeseburger is $1.49.\n[5] The Double Cheesburger is now $1.19 instead of a buck. Seriously, $.19/slice of cheese and a removal from the Dollar Menu. Do I order the Double Cheeseburger at its new full price or do I stick to the Dollar Menu and go with the McDouble. Of course, I go with the McDouble. One piece of McCheese might be better than two pieces of McCheese. I guess McDonalds thinks people like me who bought the Double Cheeseburger for a buck will pony up and pay the extra pennies. Sooner or later they will be charging for extra napkins and ketchup.\n[6] Review: Triple Cheeseburger from McDonald\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. When it comes to the various sizes of classic McDonald\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cheeseburgers, the prices might have you scratching your head. The price differences between a McDonald\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Cheeseburger, the beefier McDouble and the cheesier Double Cheeseburger now all fall within 50-cents of one another.\n[7] The Double Cheeseburger is priced at $1.49 and my Triple Cheeseburger was priced at $2.19. I just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand the point of paying 70-cents for an extra burger patty when you can just get two McDoubles for $2.00. Obviously the value of the Triple Cheeseburger makes no sense when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re comparing menu items.\n[8] The McDouble is listed as a slice of American cheese between two 100% beef patties, topped with pickles, onions, ketchup and mustard. mcdonalds.com. The Double Cheeseburger is listed as two slices of golden American cheese with two 100% all beef patties, pickles, onions, ketchup and mustard.\n[9] There are many items that can be purchased at McDonald's for just $1, really, just check their dollar menu ! Here's a tip that not everyone knows... a McDouble from the McDonalds Dollar menu is the same thing as a Double Cheeseburger-well, minus one piece of cheese (and a lot of cents).\n[10] The difference is that the Mighty Kid's Meal provides more food than what is typically found in a Happy Meal, providing a McDouble (a cheeseburger consisting of two patties and one slice of cheese) instead of a cheeseburger or a hamburger, and more Chicken McNuggets (6 versus 4), plus a larger drink (16oz vs 12oz).\n[11] A double cheesburger has 2 slices of cheese with 2 meat patties. A mcdouble on the other hand only had 1 slice of cheese, but still 2 pieces of meat. I say had because mcdoubles arent sold in Australia (maybe a few stores but not a regular menu item) anymore. Other countries might be different but that's the difference in Australia.\n[12] So whenever the McDouble hit the Dollar Menu and the Double Cheeseburger was thrown into the \u00e2\u0080\u009cBurgers\u00e2\u0080\u009d section at $1.19 or even higher ($1.29 in most places now), the average consumer scratched their head, winced their eyes, and fell over in a wrath of confusion and bewilderment.\n[13] No, The McDonald's McDouble Is Not The 'Greatest Food In Human History'.

I may be a little late to this, but it is never too late to point out how stupid it is to argue that the McDonald's McDouble cheeseburger is the greatest food in human history..\n[14] Cheeseburgers.

It's not nearly a value as the McDouble as it carries a price tag of $1.99.\n[19] It also comes in sandwich form with mayo for the same price. On the burger front, McDo has the Cheeseburger Deluxe (the Mac!) which is a cheeseburger with lettuce, cheese, and mayo at a relatively pricey (in comparison) 52 pesos ($1.17).

There is little, if any, difference in pay between a registered nurse with his/her ADN vs. BSN. The difference is management opportunity, which is geared toward the BSN.\n[11] The higher level positions have a higher average salary. For that reason, while there is no significant difference in the salary of an ADN RN and a BSN RN working as a staff nurse on a hospital unit, a nurse with a BSN will make more income over the course of their career.Many ADN graduates return to school and complete their BSN after they start working.owever, many facilities also offer a differential for the BSN degree.

Thus, it involves spasticity of the limbs rather than absolute inability to move.\n[2] There are several types of cerebral palsy, classified by the kind of movement affected, the body parts affected, and how severe the symptoms are. Some types involve intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs) as well as movement problems. Spastic cerebral palsy. This type is the most common form of the disorder.\n[3] Cerebral Palsy is considered a neurological disorder caused by a non-progressive brain injury or malformation that occurs while the child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brain is under development. Cerebral Palsy primarily affects body movement and muscle coordination. Though Cerebral Palsy can be defined, having Cerebral Palsy does not define the person that has the condition. Definition of Cerebral Palsy. While Cerebral Palsy (pronounced seh-ree-brel pawl-zee) is a blanket term commonly referred to as \u00e2\u0080\u009cCP\u00e2\u0080\u009d and described by loss or impairment of motor function, Cerebral Palsy is actually caused by brain damage.\n[4] Secondary conditions can include seizures, epilepsy, apraxia, dysarthria or other communication disorders, eating problems, sensory impairments, mental retardation, learning disabilities, and/or behavioral disorders. Speech and language disorders are common in people with Cerebral Palsy.\n[5] Causes of Cerebral Palsy Cerebral palsy is caused by damage to the developing brain before, during or after birth. There are multiple types of brain damage that can lead to different types of cerebral palsy.\n[6] Cerebral Palsy (CP) is an umbrella term to describe a group of disabilities that affect the motor control of individuals. The three classifications are Spastic, Ataxic and Athetoid. Spastic Cerebral Palsy affects people about 80% of the time and is characterized by muscle tension (known as \u00e2\u0080\u009chypertonic\u00e2\u0080\u009d) in the muscle stemming from a lesion in the motor cortex and brain. Ataxic Cerebral Palsy is reported in 10% of cases and the main brain damage is centered on the cerebellum.\n[7] The motor disorders of cerebral palsy are often accompanied by disturbances of sensation, perception, cognition, communication and behavior, epilepsy, and by secondary musculoskeletal problems. The specific motor types present in CP are determined by the extent, type, and location of a child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abnormalities. (Fig. 1) SPASTIC CEREBRAL PALSY Spastic CP is the most common type. People will experience increased muscle tone and their movements may appear stiff or awkward. Different parts of the body can be affected: Spastic hemiplegia/hemiparesis (Fig.\n[8] Types of Cerebral Palsy. Several cerebral palsy classification systems exist today to define the type and form of cerebral palsy an individual has. The classification is complicated by the wide range of clinical presentations and degrees of activity limitation that exist. Knowing the severity, location and type of cerebral palsy your child has will help to coordinate care and fund treatment.\n[9] Cerebral palsy is one of the most common congenital (existing at or before birth) disorders of childhood. About 500,000 children in the United States have the condition. The three types of CP are: spastic cerebral palsy \u00e2\u0080\u0094 causes stiffness and movement difficulties.\n[10] Cerebral Palsy: Symptoms, Types, Causes, Treatment, Prevention. 1 The first step is proper diagnosis of cerebral palsy. For that, one must be aware of what exactly are the signs and symptoms of cerebral palsy, and how it differs from other disorders.\n[11] Almost half the children affected by cerebral palsy develop hypertonia (excessive muscle tension) or spasticity (excessive muscle tension with increased tendon reflexes). This is usually caused by damage to the white matter of the brain.Other affected children can have mixed cerebral palsy, experiencing multiple symptoms with a spastic component. Cerebral palsy can result in irreversible damage and dysfunction of the nervous system.any cases of CP have unknown causes. The disorder occurs when there is abnormal development or damage to areas in the brain that control motor function. It occurs in approximately three out of every 1,000 live births. There are several types of injuries that can impair the nervous system, including: 1 Head injuries.\n[12] It is the one-sided version of spastic diplegia. It falls under the mobility impairment umbrella of cerebral palsy. About 20\u00e2\u0080\u009330% of people with cerebral palsy have spastic hemiplegia.Due to brain or nerve damage, the brain is constantly sending action potentials to the neuromuscular junctions on the affected side of the body.t is the one-sided version of spastic diplegia. It falls under the mobility impairment umbrella of cerebral palsy. About 20\u00e2\u0080\u009330% of people with cerebral palsy have spastic hemiplegia.\n[13] The spasms cause a range of different unwanted movements. Dystonic cerebral palsy often appears in combination with other symptoms of cerebral palsy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 usually the dystonic movements appear in combination with high and/or low muscle tone.For this reason, the condition is often described as cerebral palsy with dystonia.Causes. Dystonic cerebral palsy is generally caused by damage to the basal ganglia-part of the brain involved in the recruitment of muscles of movement.nything that changes or affects the normal development of the brain can lead to problems with the way it transmits information to the muscles, and therefore can cause cerebral palsy.\n[14] Dysarthria is caused by damage to the brain. This may occur at birth, as in cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy, or may occur later in life due to one of many different conditions that involve the nervous system, including. 1 stroke,\n[15] Types of Cerebral Palsy. Cerebral palsy can be described by the way it affects people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s movement, the part of the body affected and by how severe the affects are. Quadriplegia (a form of bilateral cerebral palsy) Both arms and legs are affected. The muscles of the trunk, face and mouth are often also affected.\n[16] Some children have symptoms of more than one type of cerebral palsy. For example, spastic legs (symptoms of spastic diplegic CP) and problems with facial muscle control (symptoms of dyskinetic CP) may both develop. Total body cerebral palsy affects the entire body to some degree.\n[17] There are four types of brain damage that cause cerebral palsy. The brain damage that causes motor impairment in cerebral palsy results from one of four types of brain injury or brain malformation.\n[18] Movement Disorders.

Cerebral Palsy is a term we have heard a lot in recent times. There are organizations all around the world which offer support to patients with cerebral palsy and their caregivers. It might appear that the number of patients suffering from cerebral palsy is increasing day by day.\n[4] Overview. Cerebral palsy is a disorder of muscle movement and coordination. It is caused by an injury to a child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brain that occurs before birth or during infancy.It affects the part of the brain that controls body movement.ymptoms of other types of cerebral palsy may also include floppy muscle tone and lack of muscle coordination. Tremors or an unsteady gait are also common. People who have cerebral palsy may have difficulty with speech, chewing, and swallowing, drooling and irregular breathing.\n[5] Spastic (pyramidal) cerebral palsy. Spastic cerebral palsy is the most common type. A person with spastic CP develops tight muscles in some parts of the body that are unable to relax. Affected joints become stiff and hard to move. Usually, a person has problems controlling movements, poor coordination and balance, and difficulty talking and eating.\n[6] Cerebral palsy is a neurological condition which primarily causes orthopedic impairment. Cerebral palsy is caused by a brain injury or brain abnormality that interferes with the brain cells responsible for controlling muscle tone, strength, and coordination.igns and symptoms of cerebral palsy. Signs of cerebral palsy are different from symptoms of cerebral palsy. Signs are clinically identifiable effects of brain injury or malformation that cause cerebral palsy. A doctor will discern signs of a health concern during the exam and testing.\n[7] Cerebral palsy is a general term describing conditions that cause movement problems. The most common type is spastic cerebral palsy where the muscles are stiff and rigid in one or more limbs. The underlying problem is damage to, or faulty development of, part of the brain. This usually occurs sometime before birth.\n[8] 1 spastic cerebral palsy \u00e2\u0080\u0094 causes stiffness and movement difficulties. 2 athetoid cerebral palsy \u00e2\u0080\u0094 leads to involuntary and uncontrolled movements. ataxic cerebral palsy \u00e2\u0080\u0094 causes a problem with balance and depth perception.\n[9] Diazepam is a benzodiazepine, a type of muscle relaxant used for cerebral palsy treatment. Diazepam is also known by the name Valium. Diazepam works by focusing on GABA receptors in the brain, helping to release the neurotransmitter chemical called GABA.he muscle relaxants used for treating cerebral palsy work by stopping the muscles from contracting. These medications cease or lesson the severity of several major symptoms occurring in cerebral palsy patients. The three primary drugs used in treating symptoms associated with cerebral palsy are muscle relaxants.\n[10] A: Spastic Quadriplegia is the most serious type of cerebral palsy as all four limbs and the trunk are affected.

Different parts of the body can be affected: Spastic hemiplegia/hemiparesis (Fig.\n[17] Cerebral palsy is one of the most common congenital (existing at or before birth) disorders of childhood. About 500,000 children in the United States have the condition. The three types of CP are: spastic cerebral palsy \u00e2\u0080\u0094 causes stiffness and movement difficulties.\n[18] Almost half the children affected by cerebral palsy develop hypertonia (excessive muscle tension) or spasticity (excessive muscle tension with increased tendon reflexes). This is usually caused by damage to the white matter of the brain.Other affected children can have mixed cerebral palsy, experiencing multiple symptoms with a spastic component. Cerebral palsy can result in irreversible damage and dysfunction of the nervous system.any cases of CP have unknown causes. The disorder occurs when there is abnormal development or damage to areas in the brain that control motor function. It occurs in approximately three out of every 1,000 live births. There are several types of injuries that can impair the nervous system, including: 1 Head injuries.\n[19] It is the one-sided version of spastic diplegia.

Quadriplegia is a form of cerebral palsy that is characterized by the lack of the ability to move or feel both arms, both legs, and other parts of the body affected. Quadriplegia in cerebral palsy is caused by an injury to the spinal cord, which sends messages to body parts important for movement and sensation. Spastic quadriplegia is the most severe from of cerebral palsy in which all four limbs and the trunk are affected. Children with spastic quadriplegia usually have several compounded disabilities including mental retardation, problems with muscles that control the mouth and tongue, and difficulty in speaking.\n[10] There are four types of brain damage that cause cerebral palsy.

Instead of being stored in hardware, the software token symmetric key is secured on the user\u00e2\u0080\u0099s PC, laptop, smartphone or USB device.\n[2] RSA SecurID software tokens use a highly secure provisioning protocol, the Cryptographic Token Key Initialization Protocol (CT-KIP), to support two-factor authentication. RSA SecurID software tokens integrate with more than 400 applications and devices. Integrations are available free of charge and are jointly tested by RSA and partners.\n[3] The RC4 Encryption Algorithm, developed by Ronald Rivest of RSA, is a shared key stream cipher algorithm requiring a secure exchange of a shared key. The symmetric key algorithm is used identically for encryption and decryption such that the data stream is simply XORed with the generated key sequence.he RC4 encryption algorithm is used by standards such as IEEE 802.11 within WEP (Wireless Encryption Protocol) using 40 and 128-bit keys. Published procedures exist for cracking the security measures as implemented in WEP.\n[4] 1 With a RSA key you can nominally use the RSA and DHE_RSA cipher suite. 2 But if the server certificate has a Key Usage extension which does not include the keyEncipherment flag, then you are nominally limited to DHE_RSA. 3 With a DSA key you can use only a DHE_DSS cipher suite. With a DSA key you can use only a DHE_DSS cipher suite. 2 With a Diffie-Hellman key, you can use only one of DH_RSA or DH_DSS, depending on the issuing certificate authority key type.\n[5] What is RSA? RSA is a public-key cryptosystem for both encryption and authentication; it was invented in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman [RSA78]. It works as follows: take two large primes, p and q, and find their product n = pq ; n is called the modulus.\n[6] If you have important files and want them back you have to decrypt with this tool. I can provide you this program together with the secret key. All i need is the character ids that found on your infected files..ll of your files were protected by a strong encryption with RSA-2048 using CryptoWall.

Use of asymmetric systems enhances the security of communication. Examples of asymmetric systems include RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), and ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography).\n[9] You used Kleopatra, the certificate management component of GPG4Win, to generate both a public and private key as both a sender and a receiver. You used the sender's keys to encrypt a file, sent it to the receiver, and decrypted it using the receiver's copy of the keys. Lab Assessment Questions & Answers 1. Which key do you provide anyone you want to encrypt messages with private or public keys or both? Public key is always provided as part of the handshake in order for encryption to take place. 2. What does Kleopatra allow you to do once it is installed? Once installed Kleopatra allows you to encrypt email messages, files and text with a private key. 3. What key type was used to create the certificate on Kleopatra? What other types of encryption key types are possible? Kleopatra uses both RSA (Rivest, Shamir, and Adelman encryption algorithm) and DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm) for encryption.\n[10] The public and the private key-generation algorithm is the most complex part of RSA cryptography. Two large prime numbers, p and q, are generated using the Rabin-Miller primality test algorithm. A modulus n is calculated by multiplying p and q.any protocols like SSH, OpenPGP, S/MIME, and SSL / TLS rely on RSA for encryption and digital signature functions. It is also used in software programs -- browsers are an obvious example, which need to establish a secure connection over an insecure network like the Internet or validate a digital signature.\n[11] An integer a divides a an integer b if there is an integer n with the property that b = na. You are right, the RSA signature size is dependent on the key size, the RSA signature size is equal to the length of the modulus in bytes.

The two types of PKC algorithms are RSA, which is an acronym related to this algorithm's inventors: Rivest, Shamir and Adelman and Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA).\n[16] The public and the private key-generation algorithm is the most complex part of RSA cryptography. Two large prime numbers, p and q, are generated using the Rabin-Miller primality test algorithm. A modulus n is calculated by multiplying p and q.any protocols like SSH, OpenPGP, S/MIME, and SSL / TLS rely on RSA for encryption and digital signature functions. It is also used in software programs -- browsers are an obvious example, which need to establish a secure connection over an insecure network like the Internet or validate a digital signature.\n[17] A Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a specialized chip on an endpoint device that stores RSA encryption keys specific to the host system for hardware authentication. Each TPM chip contains an RSA key pair called the Endorsement Key (EK). The pair is maintained inside the chip and cannot be accessed by software.\n[18] Part of the Hardware glossary: A Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a specialized chip on an endpoint device that stores RSA encryption keys specific to the host system for hardware authentication. Each TPM chip contains an RSA key pair called the Endorsement Key (EK). The pair is maintained inside the chip and cannot be accessed by software.\n[19] RSA Data Security Digital Signature Process. In the RSA digital signature process, the private key is used to encrypt only the message digest. The encrypted message digest becomes the digital signature and is attached to the original data. Figure 14.7 illustrates the basic RSA Data Security digital signature process.\n[20] Secure Shell (SSH) may generate an additional RSA key pair if you generate a key pair on a router having no RSA keys.

However, in humid climates specialised ventilation systems can remove excess moisture from the air.\n[17] Is a ventilator and life support the same thing? A Ventilator: A ventilator is a machine which mechanically assists patients in the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in and out of the body. It is similar to life support, \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 but has a different job rather then to keep organs alive. There are many reasons people are placed on a ventilator, and most often, doctors try to keep the use of a ventilator to the shortest number of days possible because it is often difficult to wean a patient from a ventilator.\n[18] From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Modes of mechanical ventilation are one of the most important aspects of the usage of mechanical ventilation. The mode refers to the method of inspiratory support.\n[19] Normal inspiration generates negative intrapleural pressure, which creates a pressure gradient between the atmosphere and the alveoli, resulting in air inflow. In mechanical ventilation, the pressure gradient results from increased (positive) pressure of the air source.

There seems to be no consensus on the number of hours per day that constitutes \u00e2\u0080\u009clife-support ventilation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Some countries use 12 hours, some 14 hours, some more.\n[9] Mechanical ventilation is a life support treatment. A mechanical. ventilator is a machine that helps people breathe when they are not. able to breathe enough on their own. The mechanical ventilator is. also called a ventilator, respirator, or breathing machine. Most. patients who need support from a ventilator because of a severe. illness are cared for in a hospital\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intensive care unit (ICU).\n[10] Mechanical ventilation may be defined as the use of a mechanical device to provide. ventilator support for patients. There are 2 types of mechanical ventilation: positive and. negative pressure ventilation. Positive pressure ventilation delivers a positive pressure to. inflate the lungs. Expiration is passive.\n[11] Knowledge and understanding of mechanical ventilation are central to ensuring patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 safe passage from the acute stage to weaning. The author discusses the science related to mechanical ventilation in patients with ARDS.Mechanical ventilation is one of the most commonly used technologies in critical care.Despite the prevalence of ventilators, care planning is heavily influenced by anecdote and clinical preference.nowledge and understanding of mechanical ventilation are central to ensuring patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 safe passage from the acute stage to weaning. The author discusses the science related to mechanical ventilation in patients with ARDS.\n[12] Mechanical ventilation is also called forced or induced ventilation and is done by fans and other mechanical means. This means of ventilation is very effective in controlling the humidity and air quality inside an air conditioned space.t is the movement of air from one space to other as well as supply of fresh air into the air conditioned space. Mechanical ventilation assists in controlling the humidity, contaminants, air borne particles, and general air quality.\n[13] Mechanical ventilation. For the use in architecture and climate control, see Ventilation (architecture). Mechanical ventilation is the medical term for artificial ventilation where mechanical means is used to assist or replace spontaneous breathing.\n[14] Glossopharyngeal breathing as positive pressure ventilation. Glossopharyngeal breathing is a form of positive pressure ventilation produced by the patient's voluntary muscles where boluses of air are forced into the lungs. Paralyzed patients dependent on a mechanical ventilator may be able to use GPB continuously, other than during sleep, to substitute the mechanical ventilation.\n[15] This article reviews the common modes of mechanical. ventilation, new technologies, and speci\u00ef\u00ac\u0081c ventilator strategies that have. been shown to be bene\u00ef\u00ac\u0081cial. Indications for mechanical ventilation, ventila-. tor associated pneumonia (VAP) and liberation from mechanical ventilation. are beyond the scope of this article. Perhaps one of the most confusing aspects of mechanical ventilation is. the plethora of terms and acronyms that are used. However, this subject.\n[16] Mechanical Ventilation Breathe Easy with Fresh Air in the Home Without mechanical ventilation to provide fresh air, moisture, odors, and other pollutants can build up inside a home. Improved Comfort. Mechanical ventilation systems allow a constant flow of outside air into the home and can also provide filtration, dehumidification, and conditioning of the incoming outside air.\n[17] Ventilators are medical devices that provide mechanical ventilation to assist with or replace patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 spontaneous breathing. Mechanical ventilation is often categorized based on the interface used, such as a tracheostomy tube for invasive ventilation, or a mask for non-invasive ventilation.\n[18] What Is Mechanical Ventilation? Mechanical ventilation, in the healthcare setting or home, helps patients breathe by assisting the inhalation of oxygen into the lungs and the exhalation of carbon dioxide.Depending on the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s condition, mechanical ventilation can help support or completely control breathing.oncerns how much inspiratory or \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrigger\u00e2\u0080\u009d effort is required from the ventilator to recognize that the patient is trying to inhale; this can refer to a ventilator setting, but can also be used to describe the ventilator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s responsiveness to the patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s breathing effort. Flow of breaths.\n[19] The intentional introduction of subaerial air can be categorized as either mechanical ventilation, or natural ventilation. Mechanical ventilation uses fans to drive the flow of subaerial air into a building.\n[20] We were unable to determine the amount of the overpayment for 1 of the 363 claims. For example, for one beneficiary, the documentation (e.g., time log for the mechanical. ventilation) showed that the beneficiary had received 73 hours of mechanical. ventilation.\nSearch Query: medicare's definition of mechanical ventilation.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

These episodes can occur often and at inappropriate times, for example while a person is talking, eating or driving. Although sleep episodes can happen at any time, they may be more frequent during periods of inactivity or monotonous, repetitive activity.\n[12] There are sequences which are convergent without being monotonic. For example, the sequences (-1 , 1/2 , -1/3 , 1/4 , ... ) and (1/2 , 1/22 , 1/3 , 1/32 , ... ) both converge to 0.

First, let's establish some definitions: f is said to be increasing on an interval I if for all x in I, whenever. f is said to be decreasing on an interval I if for all x in I, whenever. A function is monotonic on an interval I if it is only increasing or only decreasing on I. The derivative can help us determine whether a function is increasing or decreasing on an interval. This knowledge will later allow us to sketch rough graphs of functions. Let f be continuous on [a, b] and differentiable on (a, b) . If for all x on (a, b) , then f is increasing on [a, b] . If for all x on (a, b) , then f is decreasing on [a, b] . This should make intuitive sense. In the graph below, wherever the slope of the tangent is positive, the function seems to be increasing.\n[15] If the order \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 {\\displaystyle \\leq } in the definition of monotonicity is replaced by the strict order < {\\displaystyle <} , then one obtains a stronger requirement.

It is also important to recognize the assumption of a monotonic relationship is less restrictive than a linear relationship (an assumption that has to be met by the Pearson product-moment correlation).\n[18] Rank correlation is a measure of the relationship between the rankings of two variables or two rankings of the same variable: Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is a measure of how well the relationship between two variables can be described by a monotonic function.\n[19] On the negative numbers, numbers with greater absolute value have greater squares, so squaring is a monotonically decreasing function on (\u00e2\u0088\u0092\u00e2\u0088\u009e,0] . Hence, zero is its global minimum. The only cases where the square x2 of a number is less than x occur when, that is, when x belongs to an open interval (0,1) .\n[20] Spearman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rank correlation coefficient is a non parametric variable that gives a relation between two variables .

The adjective MONOTONE has 2 senses: 1. of a sequence or function; consistently increasing and never decreasing or consistently decreasing and never increasing in value. 2. sounded or spoken in a tone unvarying in pitch. Familiarity information: MONOTONE used as an adjective is rare.\n[5] The term monotonic may also be used to describe set functions which map subsets of the domain to non-decreasing values of the codomain. In particular, if is a set function from a collection of sets to an ordered set , then is said to be monotone if whenever as elements of , .\n[6] Two facts about these functions are: 1 if is a monotonic function defined on an interval, then is differentiable almost everywhere on, i.e. the set of numbers in such that is not differentiable in has Lebesgue measure zero. 2 if is a monotonic function defined on an interval, then is Riemann integrable.\n[7] The MONOTONIC function is often presented as a means of adding sequence numbers to table rows. Several papers present it as a solution to this programming problem. If the MONOTONIC function is used in an SQL procedure that aggregates data then the function may return non-sequential or missing results.\n[8] Two facts about these functions are: 1 if is a monotonic function defined on an interval, then is differentiable almost everywhere on, i.e. the set of numbers in such that is not differentiable in has Lebesgue measure zero.2 In addition, this result cannot be improved to countable: see Cantor function.f the order in the definition of monotonicity is replaced by the strict order, then one obtains a stronger requirement.

This article is about a voting system criterion. For the mathematical notion of an order preserving mapping, see monotonic function. The monotonicity criterion is a voting system criterion used to evaluate both single and multiple winner ranked voting systems.\n[10] In calculus, a function defined on a subset of the real numbers with real values is called monotonic if and only if it is either entirely increasing or decreasing. It is called monotonically increasing (also increasing or nondecreasing), if for all and such that one has, so preserves the order (see Figure 1).\n[11] A function f (x) is concave over a convex set if and only if the function \u00e2\u0088\u0092 f (x) is a convex function over the set.

Monotonic functions are the functions which maintained the order of functions value. As we all know that the variation in independent value also make the variation in functions value. A suitable example for this is monotonic functions or linear polynomials. The monotonic functions maintains the straight line in linear programming graph. This is also called the monotonic nature over the domain and real numbers. A monotonic function increases and decreases over the interval.\n[2] To solidify our understanding of what a monotonic function is, let's consider what a non-monotonic function is. A non-monotonic function is a function that is increasing and decreasing on different intervals of its domain. For example, consider our initial example f(x) equals x 2.\n[3] Montonic Function. When a function is increasing on its entire domain or decreasing on its entire domain, we say that the function is strictly monotonic, and we call it a monotonic function. For example, consider the function g(x) equals x 3: Notice the graph of g is increasing everywhere. Therefore, this is a monotonic function.\n[4] An important application of monotonic functions is in probability theory. If is a random variable, its cumulative distribution function is a monotonically increasing function. A function is unimodal if it is monotonically increasing up to some point (the mode) and then monotonically decreasing. When is a strictly monotonic function, then is injective on its domain, and if is the range of, then there is an inverse function on for.\n[5] In calculus, a function defined on a subset of the real numbers with real values is called monotonic if and only if it is either entirely increasing or decreasing. It is called monotonically increasing (also increasing or nondecreasing), if for all and such that one has, so preserves the order (see Figure 1).Likewise, a function is called monotonically decreasing (also decreasing or nonincreasing) if, whenever, then, so it reverses the order (see Figure 2).If the order in the definition of monotonicity is replaced by the strict order, then one obtains a stronger requirement.A function with this property is called strictly increasing.

Suicide, however, is preventable.\n[3] 1 Untreated depression is the number one risk for suicide among youth. 2 Suicide is the third leading cause of death in 15 to 24 year olds and the fourth leading cause of death in 10 to 14 year olds. 3 Young males age 15 to 24 are at highest risk for suicide, with a ratio of males to females at 7:1.\n[4] But, as a matter of public health, gun suicides are a huge problem in the United States. Suicide is the second-most common cause of death for Americans between 15 and 34, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Across all ages, it is the 10th-most common cause of death, and caused 1.6 percent of all deaths in 2012. Not all of those suicides are by gun, but a majority are.\n[5] Close to 800 000 people die due to suicide every year. For every suicide there are many more people who attempt suicide every year. A prior suicide attempt is the single most important risk factor for suicide in the general population. Suicide is the second leading cause of death among 15\u00e2\u0080\u009329-year-olds. 78% of global suicides occur in low- and middle-income countries.\n[6] More people die from suicide than from homicide. (Suicide ranks as the 11th leading cause of death; Homicide ranks 13th.) 73% of all suicide deaths are white males. 80% of all firearm suicide deaths are white males. Among the highest rates (when categorized by gender and race) are suicide deaths for white men over 85.\n[7] Suicide Facts. 1 Suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death of young persons aged 15-24 (5) 2 In 2014, 1,668 youth aged 13-18 committed suicide (5) 3 Every day approximately 105 Americans die by suicide 4 (5) Every 12.3 minutes there is a death by suicide in the United States 5 (5) Every 40 seconds there is a death by suicide worldwide (4)\n[8] Untreated depression is the number one risk for suicide among youth.

(American Association of Suicidology, 1996)\n[9] Suicide rates in the military were traditionally lower than among civilians in the same age range, but in 2004 the suicide rate in the U.S. Army began to climb, surpassing the civilian rate in 2008. Substance use is involved in many of these suicides. The 2010 report of the Army Suicide Prevention Task Force found that 29 percent of active duty Army suicides from fiscal year (FY) 2005 to FY 2009 involved alcohol or drug use; and in 2009, prescription drugs were involved in almost one third of them.\n[10] In 2013, there were 41,149 deaths by suicide in the United States.

Close to 800,000 people die due to suicide every year and there are many more who attempt suicide. Hence, many millions of people are affected or experience suicide bereavement every year. Suicide occurs throughout the lifespan and is the second leading cause of death among 15-29 year olds globally.

Goldfish fry typically take several days before they become free-swimming.\n[8] yes because once i got a betta fish and i put in a tank with a gold fish the first day the betta killed the goldfish so i boult a nother goldfish it did not kill the goldfish because i put them in sepret tanks so that's what you guys should do it because i did it try it people your goldfish will not dy.t depends. If you get a goldfish that is the same size or larger than your betta fish, I would not recommend putting it in with your betta. I have a 10 gallon fish tank with 3 fish in it. My 1 inch Shubunkin Goldfish, my betta fish and about a 2-3 inch goldfish.\n[9] Goldfish ponds need to provide clean, well oxygenated water for its inhabitants to grow up happy and healthy. A goldfish can grow up to 12 inches(30cm) plus. The minimum size pond is 8 feet X 6 feet and 3 feet deep(2.5m X 2m X 1m).The larger the pond the better for your goldfish. Being tempted to economise, some people end up building 2 or 3 ponds to get to the desired size.tep #3: If your pond is 8 feet X 6 feet X 4 feed deep, the liner would have to be 17 feet long and 15 feet wide. Double of the width and length + add 1 foot as excess on the side.\n[10] In general, bamboo will get as big as it can depending on how much space it has to grow, kind of like a goldfish in a goldfish bowl. If you want the bamboo to reach its full height, you need to be prepared to donate the space, an area at least 30 feet in circumference.aller running types, like Phyllostachys, usually grow 3-5 feet in height per year. Older, more established plants, usually at least 3 years in the ground, will grow faster than newly planted ones. Placement and care will influence how fast and tall a bamboo will grow.\n[11] They vary in their fin configuration, coloration and in their body size, which is directly influenced by their environment. When they are kept as pets in small fish tanks and aquariums, goldfish tend to stay about 1-2 inches long and never grow larger than 6 inches (15 centimeters), according to the DEC. However, in the wild, goldfish often reach 12 to 14 inches (30 to 35 cm) in length.\n[12] The common goldfish is typically sold for less than $0.25 as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfeeder\u00e2\u0080\u009d goldfish and sold when it is very small. However, though it may start out less than 1 inch long a typical comet can grow up to 1 foot in length and live as long as 20 years if healthy. And that fact alone should make it clear to you that a bowl is not a suitable home for your goldfish.\n[13] When goldfish are in a tiny bowl, they still grow, but much more slowly. It's best to provide at least one gallon of water per full grown fish. This gives goldfish room to swim and explore their home. Plan the aquarium space according to how big the fish can become, not how big he is at the time of purchase.\n[14] Get a large enough tank. The minimum tank size for one goldfish is 10-15 US gallons (56.7 liters)(Remember, they grow to about 10-12 inches (25.5-30.5 centimeters), and sometimes over!) and you will need to add 10 U.S. gallons (37.8 liters) onto that for each additional goldfish.\n[15] 1. Get a large enough tank. The minimal tank size for one goldfish is 10-15 US gallons (56.7 liters)(Remember, they grow to about 10-12 inches (25.5-30.5 centimeters), and sometimes over!) and you will need to add 10 U.S. gallons (37.8 liters) onto that for each additional goldfish.\n[16] Tank Requirements and Care. 1 1.

They're best housed in large ponds with a TON of filtration and weekly water changes. With the right size pond, filter and other equipment, caring for koi and goldfish can be lots of fun.\n[18] The tail fin of course will be long, flowy and resemble a butterfly, both in shape and color variation. The can reach a size up to 5 inches although with great care and proper size tank, can grow and flourish up to 8 inches and will live 10-15 years. Contents. 1 Butterfly Tail Goldfish Care. Care of the Butterfly Tail Fish is similar to that of other fancy goldfish. They are of mid-level hardiness, can stand slightly colder temperatures and do well for the intermediate fish keeper. They require at least a 20 gallon tank.\n[19] First Two Weeks. The hatched goldfish fry should be left alone for two days until their mouths develop and then fed fry food ever four hours for the first two weeks. Fancy goldfish breeds can be fed two or three times a day. Goldfish fry that are fed freshly hatched brine shrimp nauplii tend to grow fast and become more full-bodied.\n[20] A Goldfish will grow quicker if you increase its metabolism slightly. This can be done by keeping the water at summer temperatures of around 65F to 70F. Goldfish kept at this higher temp will also need added space (2 gals per inch of fish), air bubbles and a really good filtration system.\nSearch Query: do goldfish grow.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Fancy goldfish normally grow to 8 inches (20cm). The normal life expectancy of a single tail goldfish is about 20 years.\n[6] Common goldfish, comet goldfish, and other single tail goldfish need ponds or huge tanks as they can grow up to a foot or more in length.

These sizes are usually only attained by pond grown fish.\n[8] Of course the betta will fight back, male OR female, and will probably kill the gold-fish. When asking this question it is important to use common sense: a goldfish can grow over 12 inches long, bettas typically don't grow over 3 inches (even less for the females).t depends. If you get a goldfish that is the same size or larger than your betta fish, I would not recommend putting it in with your betta. I have a 10 gallon fish tank with 3 fish in it. My 1 inch Shubunkin Goldfish, my betta fish and about a 2-3 inch goldfish.\n[9] Common goldfish, comet goldfish, and other single tail goldfish need ponds or huge tanks as they can grow up to a foot or more in length.

A goldfish needs an aquarium of at least 30 gallons (with proper filtrati \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 on and aeration) to thrive. Only a betta can live in a fish bowl. Goldfish generally don't get as big as they say but they do get large.\n[15] In such an environment, goldfish usually don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t last any more than a couple of years. Sadly, many goldfish never live long enough to even grow the 8 inches, 10 inches, or even 20 inches long their body was destined to be. Water changes can be very stressful in a small goldfish tank. Goldfish prefer water that maintains a constant temperature.\n[16] Goldfish Only Grow to the Size of Their Enclosure. There is an element of truth to this, but it is not as innocent as it sounds and is related more to water quality than tank size. When properly cared for, goldfish will not stop growing.\n[17] How big your goldfish will grow is determined by the animal's genetics, not by the size of his environment. If your goldfish doesn't have enough space to grow to his full size, he will likely die before you notice that the environment is not large enough.\n[18] Goldfish Only Grow to the Size of Their Enclosure.

The FDA states that beef is safe when it is held at 130\u00c2\u00b0F for over 112 minutes, or 140\u00c2\u00b0F for over 12 minutes. This is very easy to do with sous vide and the main reason we recommend cooking most beef cuts medium-rare since beef is most tender at that temperature.\n[2] Before we get into some of the more common untruths surrounding sous vide, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clear something up: sous vide does not mean boiling food in a bag. Common boil-in-a-bag foods, like packaged rice and ready-made Indian dishes, involve bringing water to a boil and then placing the vacuum-packed food in the water to heat it.\n[3] Sous-vide is a method of cooking in which food is vacuum-sealed in a plastic pouch or a glass jar and then placed in a water bath or steam environment for longer than normal cooking times at an accurately regulated temperature. The temperature is much lower than normally used for cooking, typically around 55 to 60 \u00c2\u00b0C for meat, higher for vegetables. The intent is to cook the item evenly, ensuring that the inside is properly cooked without overcooking the outside, and to retain moisture.\n[4] Pork jowl--or cheek--is deeply rooted in the South, where it is often salted and cured for the winter.

The primary purpose of the plastic bag is to allow the efficient transfer of heat from the water to the food, and provide a barrier between the water and the food.\n[6] More tender chicken may sound like a good thing, but it's not the right kind of softness. Instead of tasting tender, overcooked sous-vide chicken just tastes...mushy. To test the limit of how long you can cook chicken this way, I put identical chicken breasts in 145\u00c2\u00b0F water for one, two, four, eight, 12, and 24 hours.ust like any overcooked chicken, once you get to around the 155\u00c2\u00b0F mark, sous-vide chicken starts to take on an unpleasant chalky, tacky texture (though, again, far less than with conventional cooking methods).\n[7] This is why food cooked sous vide is safe, even though it is cooked at a comparatively low temperature. For example, surface bacteria will be destroyed it you cook at. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 60\u00c2\u00b0C for a minimum of 45 minutes \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 65\u00c2\u00b0C for a minimum of 10 minutes \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 70\u00c2\u00b0C for a minimum of 2 minutes.\n[8] How does Joule work?

Presynaptic motor axons stop 30 nanometers from the sarcolemma, the cell membrane of a muscle cell.

Here the end branch forms a small button-like knob, referred to as the synaptic knob. This knob is adjacent to a tiny cleft or synapse. When a nerve impulse reaches this knob, a drug called a neurotransmitter is released from vesicles into the synapse.

Making the world better, one answer at a time. When a nerve impulse reaches the synaptic knob at the end of an axon, synaptic vesicles release a neurotransmitter that diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to specific receptors on the postsyanptic membrane. Above From:Hole's essentials of Human Anatomy & Physiology (tenth edition).\n[11] Axon terminals refer to the axon endings that are somewhat enlarged and often club-or button-shaped. Axon terminals are that part of a nerve cell that make synaptic connections with another nerve cell or with an effector cell (e.g. muscle cell or gland cell).\n[12] The synaptic knob contains vesicles filled with neurotransmitters. Therefore, Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter that stimulates skeletal muscle to contract. It is rele \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 ased into the synaptic clefts between motor neuron axons and motor end plates.\n[13] The synapse is located at the end of each axonal end branch. Here the end branch forms a small button-like knob, referred to as the synaptic knob. This knob is adjacent to a tiny cleft or synapse. When a nerve impulse reaches this knob, a drug called a neurotransmitter is released from vesicles into the synapse. The neurotransmitter diffuses across the gap and binds to receptors on the membrane of the adjacent neuron or muscle cell.\n[14] \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Each skeletal muscle cell is individually stimulated by a motor neuron. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 The neuromuscular junction is the place where the terminal portion of a motor neuron axon meets a muscle cell membrane, separated by a synaptic cleft. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 An action potential arriving at the axon terminal brings about the release of acetylcholine, which leads to depolarization of the motor end plate.\n[15] Each neuromuscular junction consists of the axon terminal of a motor neuron and the motor end plate of a muscle fibre. : 1 The long processes of neurones are called axons. : 2 The part of the sarcolemma of the muscle cell that is in closest proximity to the synaptic end bulb is called the motor end plate .ach neuromuscular junction consists of the axon terminal of a motor neuron and the motor end plate of a muscle fibre. : 1 The long processes of neurones are called axons. 2 As the axon of a motor neurone enters the structure of skeletal muscle it forms many branches called axon terminals .\n[16] The neuromuscular junction differs from chemical synapses between neurons. Presynaptic motor axons stop 30 nanometers from the sarcolemma, the cell membrane of a muscle cell. This 30-nanometer space forms the synaptic cleft through which signalling molecules are released.he neuromuscular junction is the site of the signal exchange. The steps of this process in vertebrates occur as follows:(`) The action potential reaches the axon terminal. (2) Voltage-dependent calcium gates open, allowing calcium to enter the axon terminal.\n[17] Neurotransmitters are stored in a synapse in synaptic vesicles, clustered beneath the membrane in the axon terminal located at the presynaptic side of the synapse. Neurotransmitters are released into and diffused across the synaptic cleft, where they bind to specific receptors in the membrane on the postsynaptic side of the synapse.\n[18] The terminals release transmitter substances into a gap called the synaptic cleft between the terminals and the dendrites of the next neuron. The information is received by the dendrite receptors of the postsynaptic cell that are connected to it.ctivity at an axon terminal: Neuron A is transmitting a signal at the axon terminal to neuron B (receiving). Features: 1. Mitochondrion.\n[19] At the site where the action potential is generated, usually the axon hillock, an electrical current depolarizes the neighboring region of the axon membrane. Action potentials travel in only one direction - toward the synaptic terminals.\n[20] Axons are covered by a membrane known as axolemma; the cytoplasm of axon is called axoplasm.The branched end of an axon is formed by telodendra; the swollen end of a telodendron is known as the axon terminal; which joins the dendron or cell body of another neurone forming a synaptic connection.\nSearch Query: axon terminals or synaptic knob definition.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

That is why Biology is sometimes known as Life Science.\n[11] Definition of exon. : a polynucleotide sequence in a nucleic acid that codes information for protein synthesis and that is copied and spliced together with other such sequences to form messenger RNA \u00e2\u0080\u0094 compare intron.\n[12] Genes contain exons which are regions coding for proteins and which are interrupted by the unused sequences called introns. Exons have been found to include both sequences coding for amino acids and untranslated sequences. The introns are removed and the exons are joined together to form the final functional mRNA.\n[13] In most eukaryotic genes, coding regions (exons) are interrupted by noncoding regions (introns). During transcription, the entire gene is copied into a pre-mRNA, which includes exons and introns.\n[14] To distinguish the two types of DNA, scientists call the coding sequences of genes exons and the pieces in between introns (for intervening sequences). If RNA polymerase were to transcribe DNA from the start of an intron-containing gene to the end, the RNA would be complementary to the introns as well as the exons.\n[15] Before the RNA leaves the nucleus, the introns are removed and the exons are joined together, producing an mRNA molecule with a continuous coding sequence. This process is cal \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 led RNA splicing.efore the RNA leaves the nucleus, the introns are removed and the exons are joined together, producing an mRNA molecule with a continuous coding sequence. This process is cal \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 led RNA splicing.\n[16] The reason is that both introns and exons will be defined in UCSC relative to transcripts and not the overall gene. If you grab the introns and exons for a single transcript you should not see these types of overlaps. But if you take all of the exons for all of the transcripts of a gene you will often see them. If you truly want your exon and intron BEDs to occupy mutually exclusive space in the genome, you will need to do some extra work. For example you could:\n[17] Yes. A protein produced by multiple genes are cased by fusion genes. Usually a protein is translated from a mRNA which is transcribed from a DNA. After transcription, RNA is \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 rearranged by so-called RNA splicing in which some of short sequences are selected(Exon) or deleted(Intron).During the splicing two different genes can join together and it is called trans-splicing.sually a protein is translated from a mRNA which is transcribed from a DNA.

While whole exome sequencing looks at the exon regions of the genome, whole exome sequencing looks at both the exons and introns covering the entire genome.Only about 15% of disease-causing mutations can be found in the introns.hat is the difference between whole genome AND whole exome sequencing? While whole exome sequencing looks at the exon regions of the genome, whole exome sequencing looks at both the exons and introns covering the entire genome.\n[19] Introns and exons are parts of genes. exons code for proteins, whereas introns do not. Exons are parts of DNA that are converted into mature messenger RNA . The process by which DNA is used as a template to create mRNA is called transcription. This mRNA then undergoes a further process called translation where the mRNA is used to synthesize proteins, via another type of molecule called transfer RNA.\n[20] Alternative splicing by exon skipping is also believed to play a role in exon shuffling (Keren et al., 2010). Alternative splicing allows the exons of a pre-mRNA transcript to be spliced into a number of different isoforms to produce multiple proteins from the same transcript.\nSearch Query: exons definition biology.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

The results of exon (exons in the coding region) and intron (introns between the coding exons) distributions were tabulated for further analysis.\n[7] Exons and introns are related to genes. An exon is termed as a nucleic acid sequence which is represented in the RNA molecule. Introns, on the other hand, are termed as nucleotide sequences seen within the genes which are removed through RNA splicing for generating a mature RNA molecule.\n[8] By definition, exons and introns are sequences in a protein-coding gene region of a double-stranded DNA molecule (dsDNA) that are expressed as proteins, or intervening sequences not so expressed. The exon and intron sequences are typicallly visualized as the Sense Strand of the dsDNA, written 5'-3', left to right.\n[9] These sequences, which help position the splicing apparatus, are found in the exons of genes and bind proteins that help recruit splicing machinery to the correct site. Most splicing occurs between exons on a single RNA transcript, but occasionally occurs, in which exons on different pre-mRNAs are ligated together.\n[10] For the album by LCD Soundsystem, see Introns (album) . Representation of intron and exons within a simple gene containing a single intron. An intron is any nucleotide sequence within a gene that is removed by RNA splicing during maturation of the final RNA product.The term intron refers to both the DNA sequence within a gene and the corresponding sequence in RNA transcripts.Sequences that are joined together in the final mature RNA after RNA splicing are exons.or the album by LCD Soundsystem, see Introns (album) .

The exons are the portions that eventually exit the nucleus in the form of mRNA and are used in translation. The introns are removed from the mRNA shortly after transcription. There are a number of hypotheses about the function of introns.\n[14] Most splicing occurs between exons on a single RNA transcript, but occasionally trans-splicing occurs, in which exons on different pre-mRNAs are ligated together. The splicing process occurs in cellular machines called spliceosomes, in which the snRNPs are found along with additional proteins.igure 1: Pre-mRNA splicing. Splicing of a pre-mRNA molecule occurs in several steps that are catalyzed by small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). After the U1 snRNP binds to the 5\u00e2\u0080\u00b2 splice site, the 5\u00e2\u0080\u00b2 end of the intron base pairs with the downstream branch sequence, forming a lariat.\n[15] Introns and exons are parts of genes. exons code for proteins, whereas introns do not. Exons are parts of DNA that are converted into mature messenger RNA . The process by which DNA is used as a template to create mRNA is called transcription.\n[16] Premessenger RNA has a base sequence identical to the DNA coding strand. Genes consist of sequences encoding mRNA (exons) that are interrupted by non-coding sequences of variable length, called introns. Introns are removed and exons joined together before translation begins in a process called mRNA splicing.\n[17] 1. Exons are coding areas whereas introns are non-coding areas. 2. An exon is termed as a nucleic acid sequence which is represented in the RNA molecule. Introns, on the other hand, are termed as nucleotide sequences seen within the genes which are removed through RNA splicing for generating a mature RNA molecule. 3.\n[18] Introns, Exons and Splicing hn RNA Introns are a common eukaryotic event. Several features of interrupted genes are: The sequence order is the same as in the mRNA The structure of an interrupted gene is identical in all tissues.ntrons, Exons and Splicing hn RNA. 1 The sequence order is the same as in the mRNA. 2 The structure of an interrupted gene is identical in all tissues. 3 Introns of nuclear genes have termination codons in all three reading frames.\n[19] Such stretches of DNA, which get transcribed into RNA but not translated into protein, are called introns. Those stretches of DNA that do code for amino acids in the protein are called exons. Examples: 1 The gene for one type of collagen found in chickens is split into 52 separate exons. Step-by-step removal of introns present in the pre-mRNA and splicing of the remaining exons. 2 This step takes place as the pre-mRNA continues to emerge from Pol II. 3 Synthesis of the poly(A) tail. 4 This is a stretch of adenine (A) nucleotides.\n[20] The intervening sequences that are removed are called introns. The process by which introns are removed is referred to as splicing. The sequences remaining after the splicing are called exons. All of the different major types of RNA in a eukaryotic cell can have introns.Although most higher eukaryotic genes have introns, some do not.

Introns, on the other hand, are termed as nucleotide sequences seen within the genes which are removed through RNA splicing for generating a mature RNA molecule.. Exons can be termed as DNA bases which are translated into mRNA. Introns are also DNA bases that are found in between exons. 6. Introns are very much common in the genome of higher vertebrates such as human beings and mice but unlikely to be seen in the genome of certain varieties of eukaryotic micro-organisms.\n[8] Exons. Exons are the nucleotide sequences of genes that are expressed, and those are found at either sides of an intron.

ST depression in general means subendocardial ischemia, meaning mild ischemia. However, it can also be due to changes in repolarization due to left ventricular hypertrophy depending on which EKG leads the ST depression in found in. So it is plausible that you have some left ventricular hypertrophy as a result of exercise and that is resulting in ST depression.\n[3] The treatment for left ventricular hypertrophy depends on the cause of the condition. Doctors will aim to eliminate the cause of the heart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enlargement in order to normalize the heart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts and prevent incapacitation of the heart muscles.\n[4] Over time, this can cause the heart muscle to thicken. As the heart pumps against elevated pressure in the blood vessels, the left ventricle becomes enlarged and the amount of blood pumped by the heart each minute (cardiac output) goes down, a condition called left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Without treatment, this can lead to heart failure.\n[5] Left ventricular hypertrophy is a thickening of the wall of the heart's main pumping chamber. This thickening may result in elevation of pressure within the heart and sometimes poor pumping action. The most common cause is high blood pressure.\n[6] Doctors give trusted, helpful answers on causes, diagnosis, symptoms, treatment, and more: Dr. Dhingra on can high blood pressure cause heart murmur: Hypertension causes left ventricular hypertrophy and strain and heart failure.

Elevations are also observed in pulmonary hypertension (indicating right ventricular dysfunction), acute lung injury, hypervolemic states, chronic renal failure and cirrhosis.\n[8] As enlargement progresses, though, the heart's pumping ability declines. Dilated cardiomyopathy is the main type of cardiomegaly. In dilated cardiomyopathy, the walls of both the left and right side of the heart (ventricles) become thin and stretched.

In the lungs, blood is mixed with oxygen and then pumped back to the left ventricle to be eventually distributed to the brain and to other parts of the body. There are several possible causes of hypertrophy in the right ventricular.\n[7] In the other types of cardiomegaly, the heart's large muscular left ventricle becomes abnormally thick. Hypertrophy is usually what causes left ventricular enlargement. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is typically an inherited condition. There are many techniques and tests used to diagnose an enlarged heart.\n[8] Several underlying conditions can contribute to or influence the enlargement of the heart muscle in the left ventricle. Hypertension is the most common cause, setting the stage for left ventricular hypertrophy once a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blood pressure exceeds the normal level of 140/90 mm Hg. Aside from hypertension, the condition known as aortic valve stenosis is also a common cause of the hypertrophic changes in the heart.\n[9] Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a condition in which the heart becomes enlarged and cannot pump blood efficiently. The decreased heart function can affect the lungs, liver, and other body systems. DCM is one of the cardiomyopathies, a group of diseases that affect primarily the heart muscle. Different cardiomyopathies have different causes and affect the heart in different ways. In DCM a portion of the myocardium is dilated, often without any obvious cause. Left or right ventricular systolic pump function of the heart is impaired, leading to progressive heart enlargement via ventricular hypertrophy and ventricular dilation, a process called ventricular remodeling. Dilated cardiomyopathy is the most common form of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy.\n[10] Right atrial and ventricular dilation, right ventricular hypertrophy, and dilation of the pulmonary artery (reflecting the effects of a chronically increased volume load on the right side of the heart due to Left-to-Right shunting)\n[11] Hypertensive heart disease is the No. 1 cause of death associated with high blood pressure.

Learn more about symptoms, diagnosing and treatment options from the experts at Cleveland Clinic.\n[6] Best Answer: By teenage and adult ages, the walls of the left ventricle have thickened to three to six times greater than that of the right ventricle. Rowers, cyclists, and cross-country skiers tend to have the largest hearts, with an average left ventricular wall thickness of 1.3 centimeters. Normal thickness of the left ventricular myocardium is from 0.6 to 1.1 cm (as measured at the very end of diastole. If the myocardium is more than 1.1 cm thick, the diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) can be made.\n[7] hypertrophic subaortic stenosis (idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis) a cardiomyopathy of unknown cause, in which the left ventricle is hypertrophied and the cavity is small; it is marked by obstruction to left ventricular outflow.\n[8] High blood pressure forces your heart to work harder than necessary in order to pump blood to the rest of your body. This causes the left ventricle to thicken or stiffen (left ventricular hypertrophy). These changes limit the ventricle's ability to pump blood to your body.\n[9] What is left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)? The right and left sides of your heart do different jobs. The right side takes in blood that has travelled round the body and pumps it to the lungs. From here, the blood enters the left side of the heart from where it is pumped all round your body. Because the left side of the heart has to work harder to get blood round your body, it is usually this side that becomes enlarged when your blood pressure is too high. This is sometimes called left ventricular hypertrophy or LVH for short. In other words, it is another name for an enlarged heart. People with high blood pressure and an enlarged left side of the heart have four times the risk of a heart attack than someone with the same blood pressure but a normal-sized heart.\n[10] An increase or enlargement in the size of the right ventricle of the heart is called right ventricular hypertrophy. Edema in the ankles, legs, and feet may be a manifestation of right ventricular hypertrophy. Severe enlargement of the right venticule can cause shortness of breath and chest pain. Along with discovering an enlarged heart, a chest x-ray can expose other conditions that may have lead to the enlargement.\n[11] Left ventricular hypertrophy can develop in response to some factor \u00e2\u0080\u0094 such as high blood pressure or a heart condition \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that causes the left ventricle to work harder.

Right ventricular hypertrophy: Enlargement of the right ventricle of the heart. This increase in ventricular mass is often attributed to pulmonary hypertension and is a contributor to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Source: Diseases Database.\n[2] Hypertrophy is a heart ailment that could occur in either ventricle of the heart. Consequently, right ventricular hypertrophy is the enlargement of heart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right ventricle. And more often than not, this condition is attributed to pulmonary hypertension. Right ventricular hypertrophy, or simply RVH, is considered to be one of the rare diseases of the heart.\n[3] To determine the frequency of right ventricular hypertrophy and its relation to increased left ventricular wall thickness in patients with left ventricular pressure overload, right ventricular wall thickness was measured using M-mode echocardiography with two-dimensional echocardiographic guidance in 65 patients with left ventricular pressure overload; 49 patients had essential hypertension and 16 had aortic valve stenosis.\n[4] In this condition, the walls of the left and/or right ventricles of the heart become thin and stretched. The result is an enlarged heart. In the other types of cardiomegaly, the heart's large muscular left ventricle becomes abnormally thick. Hypertrophy is usually what causes left ventricular enlargement.\n[5] Left ventricular hypertrophy is thought to be the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in the adult population. This is most commonly the result of longstanding high blood pressure which has caused secondary damage to the wall of the main pumping chamber of the heart, the left ventricle.\n[6] Heart-Healthy Living.

Right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) is a form of ventricular hypertrophy affecting the right ventricle. Blood travels through the right ventricle to the lungs via the pulmonary arteries. If conditions occur which decrease pulmonary circulation, meaning blood does not flow well from the heart to the lungs, extra stress can be placed on the right ventricle. This can lead to right ventricular hypertrophy.\n[7] Left Ventricular Hypertrophy. Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH) causes a similar pattern of repolarization abnormalities as LBBB, with ST elevation in the leads with deep S-waves (usually V1-3) and ST depression/T-wave inversion in the leads with tall R waves (I, aVL, V5-6).\n[8] Sound waves produce live-action images of your heart. Echocardiogram can reveal thickened muscle tissue in the left ventricle, blood flow through the heart with each beat, and heart abnormalities related to left ventricular hypertrophy, such as aortic valve stenosis. MRI. Images of your heart can be used to diagnose left ventricular hypertrophy.\n[9] The ventricles are the chambers in the heart responsible for pumping blood either to the lungs (right ventricle) or to the rest of the body (left ventricle). Ventricular hypertrophy may be divided into two categories: concentric (maladaptive) hypertrophy and eccentric (adaptive) hypertrophy.\n[10] catch. Candesartan Assessment in the Treatment of Cardiac Hypertrophy. A trial comparing the effects of candesartan to enalapril on the left ventricular mass index (LVMI) in patients with essential hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy.\n[11] Left ventricular hypertrophy is a thickening of the wall of the heart's main pumping chamber. This thickening may result in elevation of pressure within the heart and sometimes poor pumping action. The most common cause is high blood pressure.\n[12] What is left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)? The right and left sides of your heart do different jobs. The right side takes in blood that has travelled round the body and pumps it to the lungs. From here, the blood enters the left side of the heart from where it is pumped all round your body. Because the left side of the heart has to work harder to get blood round your body, it is usually this side that becomes enlarged when your blood pressure is too high. This is sometimes called left ventricular hypertrophy or LVH for short. In other words, it is another name for an enlarged heart. People with high blood pressure and an enlarged left side of the heart have four times the risk of a heart attack than someone with the same blood pressure but a normal-sized heart.\n[13] Several underlying conditions can contribute to or influence the enlargement of the heart muscle in the left ventricle. Hypertension is the most common cause, setting the stage for left ventricular hypertrophy once a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blood pressure exceeds the normal level of 140/90 mm Hg. Aside from hypertension, the condition known as aortic valve stenosis is also a common cause of the hypertrophic changes in the heart.\n[14] High blood pressure and heart disease. Hypertensive heart disease is the number one cause of death associated with high blood pressure. It is actually a group of disorders that include heart failure, ischaemic heart disease and left ventricular hypertrophy (excessive thickening of the heart muscle).\n[15] Hypertensive heart disease is the No. 1 cause of death associated with high blood pressure. It refers to a group of disorders that includes heart failure, ischemic heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, and left ventricular hypertrophy (excessive thickening of the heart muscle).\n[16] Left ventricular hypertrophy is thought to be the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in the adult population. This is most commonly the result of longstanding high blood pressure which has caused secondary damage to the wall of the main pumping chamber of the heart, the left ventricle.\n[17] Over time, this can cause the heart muscle to thicken. As the heart pumps against elevated pressure in the blood vessels, the left ventricle becomes enlarged and the amount of blood pumped by the heart each minute (cardiac output) goes down, a condition called left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Without treatment, this can lead to heart failure.\n[18] Left ventricular hypertrophy can develop in response to some factor \u00e2\u0080\u0094 such as high blood pressure or a heart condition \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that causes the left ventricle to work harder. As the workload increases, the muscle tissue in the chamber wall thickens, and sometimes the size of the chamber itself also increases.\n[19] In this condition, the walls of both the left and right side of the heart (ventricles) become thin and stretched. The result is an enlarged heart. In the other types of cardiomegaly, the heart's large muscular left ventricle becomes abnormally thick. Hypertrophy is usually what causes left ventricular enlargement.\n[20] In this condition, the walls of the left and/or right ventricles of the heart become thin and stretched.

Left ventricular hypertrophy was absent in one case only (case 2).\n[8] Left ventricular hypertrophy is more common in people who have uncontrolled high blood pressure. But no matter what your blood pressure is, developing left ventricular hypertrophy puts you at higher risk for a heart attack and stroke. Treating high blood pressure can help ease your symptoms and may reverse left ventricular hypertrophy.\n[9] The last common cause of right ventricular hypertrophy is the ventricular septal defect. This is a disease affecting the ventricular septum. The ventricular septum, on the other hand, is the wall that divides the right and left ventricles of the heart.\n[10] Patient Information. Left Ventricular Hypertrophy on ECG. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) means that the muscle of the left pumping chamber of the heart (left ventricle) is thickened. The left ventricle's job is to pump blood to the body, and conditions that increase the work the left ventricle has to do can lead to thickening of the muscle.\n[11] Left ventricular hypertrophy is a thickening of the wall of the heart's main pumping chamber.

In hypertrophy the heart muscle becomes thicker. This can have different causes. Left ventricular hypertrophy results from an increase in left ventricular workload, e.g., during hypertension or aortic valve stenosis. Right ventricular hypertrophy results from an increase in right ventricular workload, e.g., emphysema or pulmonary embolization. These causes are fundamentally different from hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HCM), which is a congenital misalignment of cardiomyocytes, resulting in hypertrophy.\n[4] Ventricular hypertrophy.

It happens when young abnormal white blood cells called blasts (leukemia cells), begin to fill up the bone marrow, preventing normal blood production. Doctors diagnose AML when 20 out of every 100 white blood cells in the bone marrow is a blast cell. AML is the most common acute leukemia affecting adults, with about 20,000 new cases diagnosed each year. When people have AML, blasts make copies of themselves quickly. This slows the production of red blood cells and platelets, causing tiredness from anemia and a risk of bleeding from a low platelet count.\n[4] VYXEOS (daunorubicin and cytarabine) liposome for injection 44 mg/100 mg is indicated for the treatment of adults with newly-diagnosed therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC).\n[5] Adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes abnormal myeloblasts (a type of white blood cell), red blood cells, or platelets.

FINRA Rule 3310 sets forth minimum standards for broker-dealers' AML compliance programs.\n[13] The BSA is sometimes referred to as an anti-money laundering law (AML) or jointly as BSA/AML. Several anti-money laundering acts, including provisions in title III of the USA PATRIOT Act, have been enacted up to the present to amend the BSA.\n[14] As an acute leukemia, AML progresses rapidly and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated. AML has several subtypes; treatment and prognosis vary among subtypes. AML is cured in 35\u00e2\u0080\u009340% of people under 60 years old and 5\u00e2\u0080\u009315% over 60 years old.\n[15] Heredity or Genetic Factors. Familial AML is a rare type of inherited leukemia which is transmitted by a non-sex chromosome in a dominant fashion. Certain genetic conditions can increase the risk for AML. It is very likely that identical twins who develop AML in the first year of life will both develop the disease.\n[16] Approximately 40\u00e2\u0080\u009345% of patients with de novo AML have normal cytogenetics. Progress in the molecular characterization of AML has largely focused on this group of patients, and the findings show that the majority of CN-AML patients now have a detectable recurrent genetic mutation (Table 1).\n[17] AML patients with these genetic disorders have a better prognosis. Six percent to 8% of patients with AML have structural alterations of 11q23, leading to the MLL rearrangement. The MLL gene rearrangement, also known as mixed lineage leukemia, may lead to AML composed of both myeloid and lymphoid cells.\n[18] Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) can occur in children and adults. According to National Cancer Institute (NCI), about 21,000 new cases of AML are diagnosed annually in the United States. This is the most common form of leukemia.\n[19] Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is a fast-growing cancer of the blood and bone marrow. It is also sometimes called acute myeloid leukemia.

It happens when young abnormal white blood cells called blasts (leukemia cells), begin to fill up the bone marrow, preventing normal blood production. Doctors diagnose AML when 20 out of every 100 white blood cells in the bone marrow is a blast cell. AML is the most common acute leukemia affecting adults, with about 20,000 new cases diagnosed each year. When people have AML, blasts make copies of themselves quickly. This slows the production of red blood cells and platelets, causing tiredness from anemia and a risk of bleeding from a low platelet count.\n[16] VYXEOS (daunorubicin and cytarabine) liposome for injection 44 mg/100 mg is indicated for the treatment of adults with newly-diagnosed therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC).\n[17] Adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes abnormal myeloblasts (a type of white blood cell), red blood cells, or platelets.

Pine trees however, produce a pitch that is quite flammable. Evergreens are the ones that end to be more flammable. Sap is the fluid transported in xylem cells (tracheids or vessel elements) or phloem sieve tube elements of a plant.\n[4] Mixture of large vessels and tracheids. The vascular cambium is the darker layer of cells indicated by the arrow. This meristematic. layer of cells divides inwardly to form new xylem, and outwardly to produce new phloem.\n[5] The most distinctive xylem cells are the long tracheary elements that transport water. Tracheids and vessel elements are distinguished by their shape; vessel elements are shorter, and are connected together into long tubes that are called vessels.Xylem also contains two other cell types: parenchyma and fibers.Xylem can be found: 1 in vascular bundles, present in non-woody plants and non-woody parts of woody plants. 2 in secondary xylem, laid down by a meristem called the vascular cambium in woody plants.t also allows plants to draw water from the root through the xylem to the leaf. Water is constantly lost through transpiration from the leaf. When one water molecule is lost another is pulled along by the processes of cohesion and tension.\n[6] The difference is found in the structure of the wood. Softwood contains only two types of cells, longitudinal wood fibres (or tracheids) and transverse ray cells. Hardwo \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 ods have an additional feature: pores. These pores carry water, whereas in softwoods, water is transported via the tracheids.\n[7] The most distinctive xylem cells are the long tracheary elements that transport water.

The cells within xylem and phloem link up with one another end-to-end to form long columns of cells that carry nutrients around the plant and water up from the roots. Xylem contains specialized cells called vessels and tracheids.\n[9] Best Answer: Xylem and phloem are the two components of the vascular system in higher plants. Xylem is composed of two different types of cells-tracheids or vessel elements. These cells are dead when they are functioning and that function is to transport water through the plant.(Remember that water movement occurs by Transpiration-Cohesion-Tension).hloem is a living tissue, composed of sieve tube cells, and its primary function is to transport nutrients (in sap) throughout the plant. As opposed to xylem which only transports water up the plant, phloem transports nutrients up or down, depending on where the nutrients are greatest.\n[10] Xylem is a tubular structure which is responsible for water transport from the roots towards all of the parts of the plant. Phloem is also a tubular structure but is responsible for the transportation of food and other nutrients needed by plant. Xylem imports water and minerals while Phloem transports water and food. It is the principal water conducting tissue of vascular plants. 2 Xylem consists of tracheids, vessels, xylem parenchyma and xylem fibres. 3 Also ray parenchyma Also the xylem of softwoods (Gymnospermae) do NOT contain vessels. 4 It is a living complex permanent tissue. 5 Inner phloem is alive.\n[11] There are two different types of water conducting tissues in vascular plants, both of which are constituted as xylem, they are tracheids, and vessel elements.\n[12] Water molecules move from the soil into living cells of the root, and eventually into the transport cells of the xylem, known as tracheids and vessels.\n[13] Ascent of sap. The ascent of sap in the xylem tissue of plants is the upward movement of water and minerals from the root to the crown. Xylem is a complex tissue consisting of living and non-living cells. The conducting cells in xylem are typically non-living and include, in various groups of plants, vessels members and tracheids.\n[14] The vascular tissues include xylem, which conducts water and minerals from the roots upward and throughout the plant, and phloem, which transports dissolved foods in all direc \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 tions within the plant. The main conducting vessels of xylem are the tracheids and the vessels.\n[15] The vascular tissue system is composed of two different types of tissues: xylem and phloem. Although both xylem and phloem form a continuous tissue system throughout the plant body, the two tissues have different functions.ylem: The Water-Conducting Vascular Tissue. Xylem is a complex tissue composed of several different cell types. This tissue includes parenchyma cells, fibers, and two cell types specializing in water and mineral transport: tracheids and vessel members.\n[16] Vascular Tissue. Vascular Tissue. The vascular tissues include xylem, which conducts water and minerals from the roots upward and throughout the plant, and phloem, which transports dissolved nutrients in all directions within the plant. The main conducting vessels of xylem are the tracheids and the vessels.\n[17] Like other organisms, plant cells are grouped together into various tissues. These tissues can be simple, consisting of a single cell type, or complex, consisting of more than one cell type. Above and beyond tissues, plants also have a higher level of structure called plant tissue systems.ylem and phloem throughout the plant make up the vascular tissue system. They allow water and other nutrients to be transported throughout the plant.

They allow water and other nutrients to be transported throughout the plant. Xylem is consists of two types of cells known as tracheids and vessel elements.bove and beyond tissues, plants also have a higher level of structure called plant tissue systems. There are three types of tissue systems: dermal tissue, vascular tissue, and ground tissue systems.\n[19] The bark of a tree is a mixture of old, nonfunctional phloem and the young functional phloem (periderm). Xylem: There are two types of conducting cells in xylem, tracheids and vessel elements. Both have thick lignified secondary walls and are dead at maturity.round tissue has a wide variety of functions, even though it is composed of fairly simple tissue types. Parenchyma Tissue: The most abundant, diverse, and versatile cells in a plant are found in the parenchyma tissue.\n[20] Guard cells usually have chloroplasts. Cells in xylem and phloem tissue also usually lack chloroplasts. Xylem and phloem provide structural support and internal transport of water, minerals and organic compounds in plant organs.ieve tube elements are living cells without plastids or nuclei (they are run by their companion cells, which house the nuclei and necessary organelles). Water conducting xylem cells, like tracheids and vessels, are dead at maturity and therefore don't have plastids.

Xylem carries water and dissolved ions from the roots to stems and leaves. Phloem carries dissolved sugars from the leaves to all other parts of the plant. Xylem has 2 kinds of conducting cells --- tracheids & vessel elements.\n[8] In most plants, pitted tracheids function as the primary transport cells.

The largest parenchyma cells occur in the pith region, often, as in corn (Zea) stems, being larger than the vascular bundles. In many prepared slides they stain green.\n[14] Xylem also contains two other cell types: parenchyma and fibers. Xylem can be found: 1 in vascular bundles, present in non-woody plants and non-woody parts of woody plants. 2 in secondary xylem, laid down by a meristem called the vascular cambium in woody plants.he most distinctive xylem cells are the long tracheary elements that transport water. Tracheids and vessel elements are distinguished by their shape; vessel elements are shorter, and are connected together into long tubes that are called vessels.\n[15] As similar cells work together to perform a specific function, they form tissues. A tissue system consists of one or more tissues organized into a functional unit connecting the organs of a plant. Each plant organ (roots, stems and leaves) has dermal, vascular and ground tissues.Plant tissues classified as simple tissues are composed of only one cell type and complex tissues are composed of two or more cell types.s a complex tissue, it is composed of four cell types: vessel elements, tracheids, parenchyma cells and fibers. Vessel elements, non-living, barrel-like cells, and tracheids, non-living, tapered cells, are the actual water-conducting cells of xylem tissue.\n[16] Parenchyma is an example of a simple tissue (composed only of parenchyma cells); xylem is an example of a complex tissue (composed of tracheids, vessel members, parenchyma cells, and sometimes fibers).

You might think that large trees would have wide vessels and tracheids, so that water filters fast through the tree, but actually its the opposite. Trees have narrow vessels and tracheids so that water filters slowly up the tree. This indeed is less efficient at carrying water, but wider vessels are more likely to cavitate. In a woody plant, the trunk is almost entirely composed of vessels and tracheids. Tracheids differ from vessels in being much narrower\n[5] Tracheid of oak shows pits along the walls. It is longer than a vessel element and has no perforation plates. Tracheids are elongated cells in the xylem of vascular plants that serve in the transport of water and mineral salts.Tracheids are one of two types of tracheary elements, vessel elements being the other. Tracheids, unlike vessel elements, do not have perforation plates.racheids provide most of the structural support in softwoods, where they are the major cell type. Because tracheids have a much higher surface to volume ratio compared to vessel elements, they serve to hold water against gravity (by adhesion) when transpiration is not occurring.\n[6] Xylem is made up of xylem vessels, tracheids ,xylem parenchyma and xylem fibers. Xylem vessels are tubelike structures joined end to end. Tracheids are elongated narrow cells. they are dead cells.Water and minerals move upwards through vessels and tracheids.

It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground.\n[12] Generally, they do, but look closer. Feel the needles. Spruces have stiff, prickly needles, while Douglas-firs and true firs have soft, flexible needles. Each spruce needle springs from a tiny, woody peg; in fact, this peg is one of the best ways to identify a spruce.\n[13] Members of the Picea Genus. Spruce trees and shrubs are classified in the genus Picea, which includes 35 species. It is considered to be part of the Pinaceae family, which also includes pine trees, fir trees, cedars, hemlocks, larches and a few other species.n fact, you should be able to identify a spruce tree just by looking at its needles. Anoher notable characteristic for identification is that unlike the fascicles of pine trees, each pulvinus only holds one spruce needle. The pulvini are arranged in a whorl around the branch.\n[14] The names Colorado spruce, blue spruce and Colorado blue spruce tree all refer to the same magnificent tree\u00e2\u0080\u0094Pica pungens. Large specimens are imposing in the landscape because of their strong, architectural shape in the form of a pyramid and stiff, horizontal branches that form a dense canopy.\n[15] This is a Balsam Fir, and the stiff and compact form is typical of most firs (Genus Abies). The middle tree is a Red Spruce, with the more \u00e2\u0080\u009crelaxed\u00e2\u0080\u009d and open form typical of most spruces (Genus Picea).\n[16] Sometimes a spruce can be mistaken for a fir, but you can the difference by looking closely at the needles. If the needle is flat, then it is a fir because spruce needles have four sides. Fir tree cones are much softer than pine cones. Pines and firs both are often used for landscaping purposes and shade.\n[17] Evergreen Trees. An excellent time to prune spruce and fir is late winter when they are still dormant. Spruce and fir possess side or lateral buds. The pruning cut should be just above a side bud or branch.\n[18] Biodiversity in the Boreal Forest: Trees.

When mature, the cones on a fir tree stand straight up (point towards the sky) while the mature cones on a spruce grow down towards the ground from the bottom side of the branch. The way that I remember which grows up and which grows down is that I remember the s in spruce means that the cones spray the ground.\n[6] The cones of a spruce tree are also a good way to identify the tree. Cones grow from tree branches and contain the seeds of a tree. Spruces, pines and firs all contain cones, as do other conifers like cedars and hemlock trees. Spruce cones have smooth, thin scales, and are quite flexible and easy to bend. Pine cones have scales that are thick, rough and woody, which makes the cones inflexible.\n[7] a: any of a genus (Picea) of evergreen trees of the pine family with a conical head of dense foliage, flat or 4-sided needles, pendulous cones, and soft light wood b: any of several coniferous trees (as Douglas fir) of similar habit. 2. : the wood of a spruce.

Pine, fir and spruce are common choices for wood fences because of their affordability and durability. Spruce is commonly used to create prefabricated, stockade-style or picket fences. Pine and fir fall under the category of pressure-treated woods.\n[9] Firs are often distinguished from their spruce cousins through the characteristics of their needles. Those of spruce trees are rather firm and rectangular when cut in cross section, while fir-tree needles are softer, flatter, and two-sided. The cones of fir trees are erect and have scales that fall off in autumn.\n[10] Trees are basically classified into two different categories: coniferous and deciduous trees. Coniferous trees are essentially cone-bearing trees. Trees that fall into this category include pine trees, redwood trees, spruce trees, cedar trees, Douglas fir trees and many other types of trees.The other type of tree is deciduous trees which are typically leaf-bearing trees, which fall off on a seasonal basis.oniferous trees are essentially cone-bearing trees.

White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground.\n[12] When fully mature, Colorado blue spruce trees can reach a width of 15 feet in diameter. With its top-tapering pyramid shape, the Colorado blue spruce grows about a 1/2 inch a year in diameter. As a very large tree, Colorado blue spruce requires significant spacing for it to thrive.\n[13] The names Colorado spruce, blue spruce and Colorado blue spruce tree all refer to the same magnificent tree\u00e2\u0080\u0094Pica pungens. Large specimens are imposing in the landscape because of their strong, architectural shape in the form of a pyramid and stiff, horizontal branches that form a dense canopy.\n[14] Differences Between Spruce & Fir Trees. Spruce and fir trees are biologically close cousins that belong to the family of evergreens known as conifers, or cone-bearing trees.

As a whole, spruce trees sport the traditional full Christmas tree shape, thanks to their upturned branches.\n[2] Baby Blue Eyes Colorado Spruce. Product Description. Baby Blue Eyes Spruce is a conical-shaped, fully branched selection of Colorado Spruce with a uniform growth habit and intense blue needles. On the average it will grow upward about 8 inches per year compared to some Colorado Spruce that can grow as much as 12 to 18 inches upward per year. *Nickname.\n[3] Evergreen Trees.

It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground. This habit along with the spreading branches give it a nice appearance for use as an ornamental. Trees often reach 80-140 feet in height and 1.5 to 3 feet in diameter. The oldest white spruce may reach 300 years of age.\n[5] These twig attachments will be in the form of wooden pegs for spruce and in the form of direct cups for fir. Conifers with leaf stalks called petioles will be bald cypress, hemlock, and Douglas fir trees. Move to the sections below to identify your spruce, fir or move on for more options.\n[6] What types of trees and plants can we find in the coniferous forest? Columbines, Balsam Fir Trees, Poison Ivy, Ferns Black Spruce Trees, Larch Trees, Fireweed, Mushrooms, Blue Spruce Trees, Giant Sequoia Trees, Mosses, Aspen Trees and Poison Oak. The conifer cones are used by these trees to spread their seeds around the tree, and this way the coniferous forests are growing slowly year after year.\n[7] Pinaceae -- Pine family. Gilbert H. Fechner. Blue spruce (Picea pungens) is also called Colorado blue spruce, Colorado spruce, silver spruce, and pino real. It is a slow-growing, long-lived tree of medium size that, because of its symmetry and color, is planted extensively as an ornamental.n its northern range (northern Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana), blue spruce is found only in scattered locations under established stands of narrowleaf cottonwood and among scattered ponderosa pine, with Engelmann spruce and white spruce (Picea glauca) associated with the species in the extreme north (64,84).\n[8] Common Name: Blue Spruce, Colorado Spruce. Picea abies Common Name: Norway Spruce . About the Spruce Tree . Spruce trees are coniferous (needle-leafed) evergreens. There are about 35 species in the genus Picea, native to the northern hemisphere. The name spruce is from the Latin pix, meaning pitch. These trees often live to a very old age. The oldest spruce on record is a Picea engelmannii that reached 852 years and is still thriving.\n[9] In urban areas, spruce trees are often used in landscaping, however, black spruce is rarely found as a planted species. Most urban spruce are either the native white spruce or the introduced species: Colorado blue spruce (Picea pungens), from western North America, or the Norway spruce (Picea abies), from Europe.runk of a black spruce. To tell a black spruce from a white spruce, examine the small branchlets, the cones and the habitat. Black spruce has tiny reddish hairs on the outermost branchlets and short needles (to 1.5 cm); white spruce has no hairs and has longer needles (to 2.5 cm).\n[10] Spruce trees are native to the western United States and Canada. The Colorado blue spruce, also called the silver spruce, was first discovered on Pikes Peak in 1862. Blue spruce can live 800 years. White spruce has a life expectancy of 200 or more years, with some 300-year-old specimens documented in Manitoba, Canada.\n[11] The spire-like FORM is not as acute as balsam fir. It is difficult to tell spruces apart. White spruce has longer needles that black spruce, but this doesn't help much unless you have two samples in-hand to compare. The best way to distinguish between these two similar species is to look at your feet. If you're standing in a wetland, it's probably black spruce. If you're on an upland site, it's probably white spruce. Two alien spruces are common in the U.P., Norway spruce and Colorado blue spruce. Mostly a family of the northern hemisphere, the Pinaceae have 9 genera and about 210 species.\n[12] Description: 1 White spruce is a medium-sized conifer found in northeastern United States and throughout Canada. It is the state tree of South Dakota. White spruce has a cone-shaped crown, and when grown in the open develops a conical crown which extends nearly to the ground.\n[13] Examine the cones. The cones of a spruce tree are also a good way to identify the tree. Cones grow from tree branches and contain the seeds of a tree. Spruces, pines and firs all contain cones, as do other conifers like cedars and hemlock trees. Spruce cones have smooth, thin scales, and are quite flexible and easy to bend.\n[14] The way that I remember which grows up and which grows down is that I remember the s in spruce means that the cones spray the ground. One of the best and easiest ways to tell the difference between a true spruce and fir tree is to look at the tree's cones. When mature, the cones on a fir tree stand straight up (point towards the sky) while the mature cones on a spruce grow down towards the ground from the bottom side of the branch. The way that I remember which grows up and which grows down is that I remember the s in spruce means that the cones spray the ground.\n[15] \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Dominant plant life in a coniferous forest consist of Douglas fir, Sitka spruce, western hemlock & redwood trees. \u00e2\u0080\u0093 They are usually found along the Pacific coast of northwestern United Sates & Canada, from NorCal to Alaska. Needleleaf coniferous trees such as spruce & fir; some broadleaf deciduous trees; & small, berry-bearing shrubs all participate in the dominant plant life of a boreal forest.\n[16] Evergreen species in the taiga (spruce, fir, and pine) have a number of adaptations specifically for survival in harsh taiga winters, although larch, the most cold-tolerant of all trees, is deciduous.oniferous trees are the dominant plants of the taiga biome. A very few species in four main genera are found: the evergreen spruce, fir and pine, and the deciduous larch. In North America, one or two species of fir and one or two species of spruce are dominant.\n[17] Coniferous trees are the dominant plants of the taiga biome.

Spruces have stiff, prickly needles, while Douglas-firs and true firs have soft, flexible needles. Each spruce needle springs from a tiny, woody peg; in fact, this peg is one of the best ways to identify a spruce. Spruce cones hang down from the branches like those of Douglas-fir while true fir cones stand up, but spruce cones do not have Douglas-fir's pitchfork bracts. The scales of most spruce cones are papery thin--yet another difference. And spruce bark is scaly--Douglas-fir and the true firs have smooth or ridged bark. There are approximately 40 different species of spruce in the world, but only 3 are native to the Pacific Northwest--and only 2 of those are common. Location is probably the best clue to their identity. : grows only along the Pacific coast, from northern California through southeastern Alaska, and only near sea level.\n[2] The leaves of conifers are of course their needles. On true pine trees, the needles are arranged and attached to the branches in clusters of two (red pine group), three (yellow pine group), or five (white pine group) needles per cluster. Spruce and fir trees have their needles attached individually to the branches. To tell spruce and fir trees apart, it helps to know that spruce needles are sharply pointed, square and easy to roll between your fingers. Fir needles, on the other hand, are softer, flat and cannot be rolled between your fingers. Spruce needles are attached to small, stalk-like woody projections. When needles are shed, these projections remain. As a result, the branches of spruce trees feel rough.\n[3] Least Concern (IUCN 3.1) The blue spruce, green spruce, white spruce, Colorado spruce, or Colorado blue spruce, with the scientific name Picea pungens, is a species of spruce tree.

The Blue Spruce is the state tree of Colorado and Utah, plus the U.S. National Christmas Tree is also a Blue Spruce. Description . Spruce trees are large, with some species maturing up to 200 feet tall. They have a strongly conical shape, especially when they are young.\n[8] Spruce Tree Scientific Name, Picea. Spruce trees are cone bearing trees and can therefore be classified as coniferous. Other coniferous trees include pine trees, Douglas Fir trees, redwood trees and cedar trees.

To tell spruce and fir trees apart, it helps to know that spruce needles are sharply pointed, square and easy to roll between your fingers. Fir needles, on the other hand, are softer, flat and cannot be rolled between your fingers. Spruce needles are attached to small, stalk-like woody projections. When needles are shed, these projections remain. As a result, the branches of spruce trees feel rough.\n[15] The leaves of conifers are of course their needles. On true pine trees, the needles are arranged and attached to the branches in clusters of two (red pine group), three (yellow pine group), or five (white pine group) needles per cluster. Spruce and fir trees have their needles attached individually to the branches. To tell spruce and fir trees apart, it helps to know that spruce needles are sharply pointed, square and easy to roll between your fingers. Fir needles, on the other hand, are softer, flat and cannot be rolled between your fingers. Spruce needles are attached to small, stalk-like woody projections. When needles are shed, these projections remain. As a result, the branches of spruce trees feel rough.\n[16] Like fir trees, spruces have single needles connected to the stems. However, spruce tree needles are sharp and square-shaped. On a real tree, spruce needles easily break apart if you bend them. As a whole, spruce trees sport the traditional full Christmas tree shape, thanks to their upturned branches.\n[17] Michigan State University Extension Service. 1 The principal hosts of Cytospora canker, which is caused by Cytospora kunzei, are the Colorado blue spruce and its varieties. The disease also occurs on Norway spruce, Koster's blue spruce, white spruce, Douglas fir and other spruces planted as ornamentals.\n[18] Spruce Spider Mite. Browning of needles on the interior of a tree in summer can be a symptom of spruce spider mites. The insects are very small and so a magnifying glass or microscope will be needed to see the mites. Douglas-fir tussock moth. This is an important defoliator of spruce, Douglas-fir, true fir and other conifers.\n[19] Generally, they do, but look closer. Feel the needles. Spruces have stiff, prickly needles, while Douglas-firs and true firs have soft, flexible needles. Each spruce needle springs from a tiny, woody peg; in fact, this peg is one of the best ways to identify a spruce. Spruce cones hang down from the branches like those of Douglas-fir while true fir cones stand up, but spruce cones do not have Douglas-fir's pitchfork bracts. The scales of most spruce cones are papery thin--yet another difference. And spruce bark is scaly--Douglas-fir and the true firs have smooth or ridged bark. There are approximately 40 different species of spruce in the world, but only 3 are native to the Pacific Northwest--and only 2 of those are common. Location is probably the best clue to their identity. : grows only along the Pacific coast, from northern California through southeastern Alaska, and only near sea level.\n[20] Blue spruce trees do poorly in shade, preferring full sun.

The west coast is the active margin, and is the location of earthquakes, volcanoes, and mountains. The Eastern Seaboard is a passive margin, as is the Gulf Coast. These are the low-relief areas of our continent, and are the locations of such exciting places as New Jersey, the Barrier Islands, the swamps of Florida, and the Mississippi delta.\n[6] Active Margins. occur where oceanic lithosphere is being subducted beneath the edge of the continent. the result is a relatively narrow margin that consists of highly deformed sediment that was scraped from the decending lithospheric slab and plastered against the margin of the overriding continent.ame thing as oceanic ridge. Long well developed divergent plate boundary, sea floor is elevated forming a broad line swell called the ocean ridge. knowledge of the ridge comes from soundings of the ocean floor and floor samples from deep sea drilling, visual inspections from deep submersibles.\n[7] This is a common question that many ask when requesting a raise or a promotion. The value for each employee can be calculated for each employee by determining what is known as marginal value. Marginal is a fancy word that is often used in economics to mean additional. You will notice that marginal is often attached to another word - such as marginal cost, marginal value, or marginal utility.\n[8] Because the subduction zone (which is also the plate boundary) is generally an arc-shape, geologists named those volcanoes volcanic arcs. A volcanic arc built on continental crust is called a continental arc; when built on oceanic crust the volcanoes form an island arc.he continental arc is formed at an active continental margin where two tectonic plates meet and a subduction zone develops.\n[9] Operating Margin.

Explain you answer.\n[12] Where the plates meet, their relative motion determines the type of boundary: convergent, divergent, or transform. Earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation occur along these plate boundaries.The lateral relative movement of the plates typically ranges from zero to 100 mm annually. Convergent boundaries (Destructive) (or active margins) occur where two plates slide toward each other to form either a subduction zone (one plate moving underneath the other) or a continental collision.\n[13] A marginal change is a proportionally very small addition or subtraction to the total quantity of some variable. Marginal analysis is the analysis of the relationships between such changes in related economic variables. Important ideas developed in such analysis include marginal cost, marginal revenue, marginal product, marginal rate of substitution, marginal propensity to save, and so on. In microeconomic theory, marginal concepts are employed primarily to explicate various forms of optimizing behavior.\n[14] Profile illustrating the shelf, slope and rise. The continental margin is the zone of the ocean floor that separates the thin oceanic crust from thick continental crust.Together, the continental shelf, continental slope, and continental rise are called continental margin. Continental margins constitute about 28% of the oceanic area.he transition from continental to oceanic crust commonly occurs within the outer part of the margin, called continental rise. Oceanwards beyond the edge of the rise lies the abyssal plain.\n[15] They are usually, but not always, located near the margins of the huge lithospheric plates that makeup the Earth's surface. The shapes of volcanic landforms are a reflection of the composition of the lavas that are extruded by the volcano. Lava composition also affects the type of activity exhibited by the volcano.Before we return to the types of volcanoes we should revisit the nature of the magma and how lavas reach the surface.hey are usually, but not always, located near the margins of the huge lithospheric plates that makeup the Earth's surface.

Lava composition also affects the type of activity exhibited by the volcano.\n[16] Contribution Margin Ratio. The contribution margin ratio takes the concept of the contribution margin per unit produced and calculates it as a percentage of the sales price per unit. This shows what percentage of sales is made up of the contribution margin. Managerial accountants also use the contribution margin ratio to calculate break-even points in the break-even analysis.\n[17] Some convergent margins have zones of active seafloor spreading behind the island arc, known as back-arc basins. When one plate is composed of oceanic lithosphere and the other is composed of continental lithosphere, the denser oceanic plate is subducted, often forming an orogenic belt and associated mountain range.\n[18] What is 'Incremental Cost'. Incremental cost, also referred to as marginal cost, is the encompassing change a company experiences within its balance sheet or income statement due to the production and sale of one additional unit of production. It is calculated by analyzing the additional charges incurred based on the change in a certain activity.\n[19] Benefits of opening a margin account with us. 1 Take advantage of competitive interest rates on margin account loans. 2 Use margin-eligible securities in your RBC Direct Investing account as collateral for the loan. 3 Pay only $9.95 flat per trade with no minimum balance or trading activity or $6.95 flat per trade with 150+ trades per quarter.\n[20] is an actual plate boundary, where oceanic crust and continental crust crash into each other.

As you probably know the theory of plate tectonics posits the outer layer of the Earth consist of plates which move relative to each other driven by convection in the Mantle.\n[2] Passive Continental Margins-A passive continental margin occurs in the interior of plate, far away from any plate boundary. Present examples of passive continental margins are the Atlantic coast of North and South America, Europe, and Africa.\n[3] For illustration only.

Continental margins are relevant because many people live near coasts. Plate margins are relevant becuase that's where plate interact.\n[8] Whilst most volcanic activity happens at plate margins, there are cases of volcanoes erupting in the middle of plates. The Hawaiian Islands are formed by volcanic activity, despite the nearest plate margin being 3,200 km away. Some geologists have suggested that a 'hot spot' in the mantle, which remains stationary as the Pacific Plate moves over it, explains the existence of the island chain. The hot spot may represent the top of a mantle plume which originated deep down at the outer core - lower mantle boundary.\n[9] TradeStation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s margin rates are in line with the industry average.

Also called marginal utility. accounting\n[10] But in order to sell it, you may have to discount it, promote it or mark it down for clearance at the end of the season. Gross margin is the profit you actually earn when you sell it after any discounting or markdowns; it is frequently called maintained margin. This spread will be specific to your business, depending upon your level of promotional and clearance activity. Margin erosion will naturally occur unless you actively manage your markup percentages. Several factors can cause overall margins to erode, including: competitive price pressures forcing below-standard markups; vendor price increases pushing retail prices up against natural price points; and unanticipated shifts in sales mix toward lower-priced and lower-margin merchandise.\n[11] Active Margins. occur where oceanic lithosphere is being subducted beneath the edge of the continent. the result is a relatively narrow margin that consists of highly deformed sediment that was scraped from the decending lithospheric slab and plastered against the margin of the overriding continent.\n[12] Best Answer: An active margin is a tectonic plate boundary, a passive margin is a compositional transition within a tectonic plate. As you probably know the theory of plate tectonics posits the outer layer of the Earth consist of plates which move relative to each other driven by convection in the Mantle.\n[13] Convergent boundaries (Destructive) (or active margins) occur where two plates slide toward each other to form either a subduction zone (one plate moving underneath the other) or a continental collision.\n[14] 1 Convergent boundaries (Destructive) (or active margins) occur where two plates slide toward each other to form either a subduction zone (one plate moving underneath the other) or a continental collision.\n[15] DISTRIBUTION OF ACTIVE VOLCANOES.

This forms an active continental margin between the subduction zone and the edge of the continent. The leading edge of the continental plate is usually studded with steep andesitic mountain ranges.\n[18] 1 An oceanic trench forms offshore, and a chain of volcanic mountains forms just inland of the coast. 2 This type of boundary between oceanic crust and continental crust is called an active continental margin since it is a plate boundary. 3 At other convergent boundaries, oceanic plate meets other oceanic plate.\n[19] Some convergent margins have zones of active seafloor spreading behind the island arc, known as back-arc basins. When one plate is composed of oceanic lithosphere and the other is composed of continental lithosphere, the denser oceanic plate is subducted, often forming an orogenic belt and associated mountain range.\n[20] Because the subduction zone (which is also the plate boundary) is generally an arc-shape, geologists named those volcanoes volcanic arcs. A volcanic arc built on continental crust is called a continental arc; when built on oceanic crust the volcanoes form an island arc.he continental arc is formed at an active continental margin where two tectonic plates meet and a subduction zone develops.\nSearch Query: what is a active margin.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Volcanic activity and the Earth's tectonic plates Stratovolcanoes tend to form at subduction zones, or convergent plate margins, where an oceanic plate slides beneath a continental plate and contributes to the rise of magma to the surface. At rift zones, or divergent margins, shield volcanoes tend to form as two oceanic plates pull slowly apart and magma effuses upward through the gap.\n[7] Marginal Cost.

Best Answer: The great majority of seismicity on the planet occurs at plate boundaries. Where plate pull apart slide by each other or collide, there is tectonic activity manifested as earthquakes. Volcanism is associated with two of the plate boundary types: divergent and convergent margins. Where two plates containing continental crust at their margins collide, there is little or no volcanism (such as at the Himalaya).\n[9] Activity at the Margins of a Batholith.

Active plate margins are often the site of earthquakes and volcanoes. Oceanic crust created by seafloor spreading in the East Pacific Rise, for instance, may become part of the Ring of Fire, the horseshoe-shaped pattern of volcanoes and earthquake zones around the Pacific ocean basin.\n[7] The overall rate may be extremely slow (one to ten centimeters per year), but the long term effect is a continual re-shaping of the surface of our planet. An active continental margin is found on the leading edge of the continent where it is crashing into an oceanic plate. An excellent example is the west coast of South America. Active margins are commonly the sites of tectonic activity: earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain building, and the formation of new igneous rock.\n[8] the overall rate may be extremely slow one to ten centimeters per year but the long term effect is a continual re shaping of the surface of our planet an active continental margin is found on the leading edge of the continent where it is crashing into an oceanic platean excellent example is the west coast of south america active margins are commonly the sites of tectonic activity earthquakes volcanoes mountain building and the formation of new igneous rockhis is an easy one the earth s crust is broken into sections called plates there are two 2 basic types oceanic plates which are composed of basalt and continental plates which are mostly granite\n[9] In marginal analysis, continually increase the control variable to the point at which the marginal cost is either equal to or greater than the marginal benefit. The reason for this is simple. You can continue to experience some level of benefit, despite the increase in cost.n marginal analysis, the cost of an activity is measured against incremental changes in volume to determine how the overall change in cost will affect the bottom line of a business. Marginal analysis can show the cost of additional production by a business all the way up to the break-even point.\n[10] Compare the continental margins of the Atlantic ocean and the Pacific ocean.

This type of margin experiences little, if any, volcanic or earthquake activity. The build-up of sediment is the primary activity affecting a passive margin.\n[2] Profile illustrating the shelf, slope and rise. The continental margin is the zone of the ocean floor that separates the thin oceanic crust from thick continental crust.Together, the continental shelf, continental slope, and continental rise are called continental margin. Continental margins constitute about 28% of the oceanic area.arthquakes and volcanic eruptions are common on the west coast of North America, but there are no active volcanoes on the east coast and large magnitude earthquakes are rare. Geologists refer to the west coast as (tectonically) active continental margin and the east coast a passive continental margin.\n[3] Passive margin. A passive margin is the transition between oceanic and continental lithosphere that is not an active plate margin. A passive margin forms by sedimentation above an ancient rift, now marked by transitional lithosphere. Continental rifting creates new ocean basins.\n[4] Making the world better, one answer at a time. Passive continental margins are not areas of convergence. There is little volcanic and earthquake activity on passive margins. Active margins are areas of convergence where one plate is descending beneath another. They are associated with volcanic and earthquake activity.\n[5] the continental margin is the submerged outer edge of a continent it is generally divided into two sections the continental shelf and the continental slope the continental shelf is the region that extends seaward from the shoreline to a sharp drop off that marks the beginning of the continental slope continental margin that has a broad continental shelf a gentle continental slope and a pronounced continental rise is known as a passive continental margin this type of margin experiences little if any volcanic or earthquake activity the build up of sediment is the primary activity affecting a passive margin\n[6] In general, the continental shelves bordering active margins are narrower than those along passive margins.

A continental margin that has a very narrow, or even nonexistent, continental shelf and a narrow and steep continental slope is known as an active continental margin. Instead of ending in a continental rise, the continental slope of this type of margin often plunges into a deep-ocean trench, which may be filled with sediment.\n[9] Companies use marginal analysis as a decision-making tool to help them maximize their profits.

Elizabeth H \u00c2\u00b7 6 years ago. Thumbs up.\n[19] A continental margin that has a broad continental shelf, a gentle continental slope, and a pronounced continental rise is known as a passive continental margin. This type of margin experiences little, if any, volcanic or earthquake activity. The build-up of sediment is the primary activity affecting a passive margin.he continental shelf is the region that extends seaward from the shoreline to a sharp drop-off that marks the beginning of the continental slope. That drop-off is known as the continental shelf break. Continental shelves vary in width from 3 to 930 miles (5 to 1,500 kilometers).\n[20] An active continental margin refers to the submerged edge of a continent overriding an oceanic lithosphere at a convergent plate boundary by opposition with a passive continental margin which is the remaining scar at the edge of a continent following continental break-up.\nSearch Query: what is a active margin.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Marginal analysis is an examination of the additional benefits of an activity compared to the additional costs incurred by that same activity. Companies use marginal analysis as a decision-making tool to help them maximize their potential profits.\n[6] Both passive and active continental margins are located near coastlines. The main difference is that active margins are the main sites where tectonic activity takes place (lik \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 e earthquakes). This is because the continental shelf of active continental margins collide with an oceanic plate, creating subduction.\n[7] 1 A Continental Margin is a boundary between continental crust and oceanic crust. 2 Active continental margins occur along plate boundaries, while passive continental margins occur at the boundary that marks a continent and the oceanic crust. 3 Mountain building takes place along active continental margins only.\n[8] Financial analysis.

Geologists refer to the west coast as (tectonically) active continental margin and the east coast a passive continental margin.\n[19] Passive margin. A passive margin is the transition between oceanic and continental lithosphere that is not an active plate margin. A passive margin forms by sedimentation above an ancient rift, now marked by transitional lithosphere. Continental rifting creates new ocean basins.\n[20] Making the world better, one answer at a time. Passive continental margins are not areas of convergence. There is little volcanic and earthquake activity on passive margins. Active margins are areas of convergence where one plate is descending beneath another.

Contour farming replicates the effects of terrace farming, but on a smaller scale.\n[6] When the desired point is on a contour line, its elevation is that of the contour. For a point between contours, most military needs are satisfied by estimating the elevation to an accuracy of one half of the contour interval. All points less than one fourth of the distance between the lines are considered to be at an elevation of one half of the contour interval above the lower line (fig.\n[7] When contour lines are close together, the slope of the hill is (gentle /steep).

Dental insurance typically does not cover dental contouring, which is considered purely cosmetic. However, tooth contouring might sometimes be covered if the reshaping is required after an accident or injury. Related articles: Dental Bonding, Teeth Whitening, Dental Veneers, Braces: What should be included: 1 The improvements provided by tooth shaping can be subtle. 2 Dental contouring is relatively pain-free, and is often done in one visit to the dentist. 3 Dental contouring is not a substitute for braces or other procedures that make major changes in the position or appearance of teeth.\n[10] Contour Quick Test When the contour lines of a hill are far apart at first, then come close together, the hill is _____.

This fault line is between the blue/green contour lines and the purple/red/yellow contour lines. The thin red circular contour line in the middle of the map indicates the top of the oil reservoir. Because gas floats above oil, the thin red contour line marks the gas/oil contact zone.\n[12] Contour Lines: Contour lines are used to determine elevations and are lines on a map that are produced from connecting points of equal elevation (elevation refers to height in feet, or meters, above sea level).lace the paper with the labeled contour lines at the bottom of the profile paper and project each contour to the horizontal line of the same elevation. f. Connect the points. Stream Gradient: Stream gradient can also be determined from a topographic map.\n[13] Topographic maps are also commonly called contour maps or topo maps.. In the United States, where the primary national series is organized by a strict 7.5\u00c2\u00b0 grid, they are often called topo quads (or quadrangles).Topographic maps conventionally show topography, or land contours, by means of contour lines.Contour lines are curves that connect contiguous points of the same altitude (isohypse).

Index contours are usually shown as every fifth contour with their assigned values, to facilitate reading elevations.\n[16] The elevation or differences in elevation on the surface is usually shown as contours. A contour line is a line that connects points of equal elevation. There is usually a contour interval set, say 1-foot for conventional survey.An aerial topographic survey may have a contour interval of 2-foot to 5-foot typically.or example, a 1-foot contour topographic survey might require shots at a 20-30 foot interval and also shots along all breaklines. A breakline is a point at which the contour changes abruptly, like the back of a curb, or the center line of a roadway.\n[17] Instead of layering my contour overtop of my powder where it can look really dramatic, I apply my primer, foundation and concealer, then my contour, then the powder overtop. Alle on the left is wearing contour atop her powder. Alle on the right is wearing the same amount of contour with her powder on top. This softens the color and prevents it from looking too dark, which is sometimes what you want. This is also a really good way to turn the volume down on matte bronzer--which may be relevant to your summer interests.\n[18] Using the Contour Line poster, point out the characteristics of a contour line drawing (outlines the object, no sketchy lines, shows detail, no shading, and can use thick and thin lines). Contrast contour lines with gesture lines. Read the poster:\n[19] Contour Lines. Contour lines are the most common method of showing relief and elevation on a standard topographic map. A contour line represents an imaginary line on the ground, above or below sea level. All points on the contour line are at the same elevation.\n[20] Contour lines normally connect areas with equal data values, so may generally be called isolines or isopleths-lines of the same value. Normally, the primary set of contour lines is displayed as a solid line, while the secondary contour is displayed as a &shed line. For example, a standard 850-hPa, 24-hour prognosis chart has height contours in solid lines, temperature contours in dashed lines, and wind speed and direction as plotted data.\nSearch Query: what can contour plowing reduce.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

The contour interval is found along the bottom edge, center of the map. 2 When calculating the elevation of a point you should always determine the contour interval first. 3 Click here to see the contour interval of a USGS Topographic Map.\n[2] Contour lines follow certain rules. Contour lines on topographic maps can help you visualize landforms. Think of the following statements as rules for reading such maps: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Lines never cross. Contour lines never cross, because each linerepresents an exact elevation.he more gradual the slope, thefarther apart the contour lines on the map.The steeper the slope, the closer togetherthe contour lines.The of an area is the difference between its high and lowpoints.

An aerial topo survey is done from aerial photos taken from an airplane or helicopter at a certain distance above the ground.\n[4] Jake Sutton/Flickr. Definition: A contour is the line which defines a form or edge-an outline. Contour drawing is the place where most beginners start, following the visible edges of a shape. The contour describes the outermost edges of a form, as well as dramatic changes of plane within the form. ' Blind contour drawing ' is when contour drawing is done without looking at the paper.\n[5] The definition of contour is the outline of something, such as of a social or geographic boundary. Behaviors that are within the bounds of what is socially acceptable are examples of behaviors that fit within the contours of society. The outline of the mountains seen in the distance is an example of the contour of the mountains.\n[6] You can get the LevelList property to see the contour line values: Suppose you want to view the contour value 4.375 instead of the value of 4 that the contour function used. To do this, you need to set both the LevelList and TextList properties: See the example Contour Plot of a Function for additional information.\n[7] Choosing a Light-contour vs a Standard-contour barrel depends on what type of barrel the forearm was made to take. If the 870 is a older model it probably will take the standard-contour better. The fit of the forearm to the barrel will be better. If its a newer gun then it was probably made for the light-contour. As far as strength of the barrels they are the same.\n[8] (2) Point b is one-half the distance between contour lines. The contour line immediately below point b is at an elevation of 160 meters. The contour interval is 20 meters; thus one-half the contour interval is 10 meters. In this case, add 10 meters to the last contour line of 160 meters.\n[9] Dictionary entry overview: What does plow mean? \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 PLOW (noun) The noun PLOW has 1 sense: 1. a farm tool having one or more heavy blades to break the soil and cut a furrow prior to sowing Familiarity information: PLOW used as a noun is very rare. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 PLOW (verb) The verb PLOW has 3 senses: 1. to break and turn over earth especially with a plow\n[10] What is an index contour? Quick Answer. An index contour is one of the ways that vertical dimension, or vertical scale, is demonstrated on a topographical map. The index contour represents the vertical scale on a map region by a thick solid line with the various elevations printed on it.\n[11] 2. Use terrace farming.

Contour lines are the most common method of showing relief and elevation on a standard topographic map. A contour line represents an imaginary line on the ground, above or below sea level. All points on the contour line are at the same elevation.\n[18] The elevation or differences in elevation on the surface is usually shown as contours. A contour line is a line that connects points of equal elevation. There is usually a contour interval set, say 1-foot for conventional survey.An aerial topographic survey may have a contour interval of 2-foot to 5-foot typically.or example, a 1-foot contour topographic survey might require shots at a 20-30 foot interval and also shots along all breaklines. A breakline is a point at which the contour changes abruptly, like the back of a curb, or the center line of a roadway.\n[19] A contour line accentuated by a heavier line weight to distinguish it from intermediate contour lines. Index contours are usually shown as every fifth contour with their assigned values, to facilitate reading elevations.\n[20] Ideally, this will be a topographic map, which is the kind with the squiggly lines on it. Called contour lines, they can tell you whether you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be hiking uphill, downhill, or over flat land. Learning how to read contour lines is an important skill to learn if you want to become a better day hiker or backpacker.For example, when planning a hike, you can trace the path you plan to take and see whether it has hills or cliffs which might be dangerous and too difficult for the people you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re hiking with climb.hen reading a topographic map,there are a couple of things you should remember about the contour lines. (Watch the video \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite good.). 1 Every point of the same contour line has the same elevation. 2 One side of a contour line is uphill and one is downhill.\nSearch Query: what can contour plowing reduce.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

(noun) Behaviors that are within the bounds of what is socially acceptable are examples of behaviors that fit within the contours o...\n[5] A contour line is a line drawn on a topographic map to indicate ground elevation or depression. A contour interval is the vertical distance or difference in elevation between contour lines. Index contours are bold or thicker lines that appear at every fifth contour line.\n[6] These lines are evenly spaced apart. We call this spacing the contour interval. For example, if your map uses a 10-foot contour interval, you will see contour lines for every 10 feet (3 meters) of elevation -- lines at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and so on. Different maps use different intervals, depending on the topography.o make topographic maps easier to read, every fifth contour line is an index contour.

More generally, a contour line for a function of two variables is a curve connecting points where the function has the same particular value.The gradient of the function is always perpendicular to the contour lines. contour line (also isoline, isopleth, or isarithm) of a function of two variables is a curve along which the function has a constant value.\n[9] You can see that the contour lines form concentric 'circles' (complete loops of contour lines within another loop and so on). This is what defines the structure as a 'complete hill' rather than a slope or part of another feature.You may be able to see that the height of the hill varies from around 230m to 386m.

The contour interval is found along the bottom edge, center of the map. 2 When calculating the elevation of a point you should always determine the contour interval first. 3 Click here to see the contour interval of a USGS Topographic Map.\n[14] Contour lines follow certain rules. Contour lines on topographic maps can help you visualize landforms. Think of the following statements as rules for reading such maps: \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Lines never cross. Contour lines never cross, because each linerepresents an exact elevation.he more gradual the slope, thefarther apart the contour lines on the map.The steeper the slope, the closer togetherthe contour lines.The of an area is the difference between its high and lowpoints.

What is Teeth Contouring? Teeth contouring is the process of gently polishing away a minimal portion of your tooth enamel to adjust the shape or texture of your teeth. Teeth contouring is an affordable cosmetic dentistry treatment where small changes can make a big difference. Teeth contouring is gentle, safe and minimally invasive.\n[5] Look in the margin of your map to find out its contour interval.

Botox\u00c2\u00ae injection can improve an individual's appearance in many ways, like reducing wrinkles and creases in the skin, but what many people do not know is that it can also be used for facial contouring.\n[2] The basic principle behind preventing any erosion is find a way to lessen the impact of the cause, such as rain and wind. For prevention of rain-driven erosion, it is important to anchor the dirt down, such as with grass, or prevent water from collecting and picking up dirt as it flows down slope. A common way to prevent this is contour ploughing. What is... Making slopes into steps so that rain cannot run down a hill carrying soil off. When building terraces, it is important to stabilize the slope. -The easiest way to do this is to plant grass. If there is enough rock around it may be possible to construct a wall out of them. Contour Ploughing- Similar to terracing, except that it follows the contours of a hill more closely than terracing, possibly even encircling a hill top The contours are not wide like terraces.\n[3] Video: Contour Line in Art: Definition, Drawing & Examples. This lesson will provide you with the fine art definition of a contour line. At the end of the lesson, you will know what a contour line looks like and how an artist might effectively use them. In the world of art, a contour line is a line which defines a form or an edge. It is, essentially, the outline or silhouette of a given object or figure.\n[4] contour(Z,n) draws a contour plot of matrix Z with n contour levels where n is a scalar. The contour levels are chosen automatically. contour(Z,v) draws a contour plot of matrix Z with contour lines at the data values specified in the monotonically increasing vector v. To display a single contour line at a particular value, define v as a two-element vector with both elements equal to the desired contour level. For example, to draw contour lines at level k, use contour(Z,[k k]).\n[5] To make topographic maps easier to read, every fifth contour line is an index contour.

They are the lines that reflect the movement of your eye in and around what you see. While contour lines describe edges, cross-contours describe form and volume. These lines can follow planes of form, moving around and across objects as well as through them. Think of a topographical map--the lines move across the terrain. Cross-contour lines do the same thing.\n[7] The elevation or differences in elevation on the surface is usually shown as contours. A contour line is a line that connects points of equal elevation.

Farmers can reduce soil erosion by contour plowing. The correct option among all the options that are given in the question is the second option or option B. The other choices given in the question are incorrect and can be neglected. I hope that this is the answer that has actually come to your desired help.\n[3] A: Contour plowing conserves soil by following the lay of the land and creating ridges that form a water break to prevent soil erosion. Furrows that do not follow the lay of the land cause rapid runoff during rainfall by forming a convenient channel for the water to flow downhill.\n[4] Tilling the field at right angles to the natural slope after drawing up the elevation contour lines is called contour ploughing in soil, prevents and reduces soil erosion. Terrace Farming In terracing, wide steps are cut around the slopes of hills to prevent soil erosion. Contour ploughing follows the \u00e2\u0080\u009cnatural shape\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the slope without altering it. Terrace farming alters the shape of the slope to produce flat areas that provide a catchment for water.\n[5] Which factors contributed to the dust bowl? Drought, dust storms, and intensive farming Later, scientists discovered that plowing along the contours of the land would have relieved some of the loss of topsoil.\n[6] \u00c2\u00b7 just now. 1 The distinction between plowing and furrowing must be that furrowing by some convention excludes furrowing on the contour. But in areas with drifting dry soil, furrowing across the direction of the wind can bring that wind erosion under control long enough for a crop to emerge and keep the soil there.\n[7] Tilling the field at right angles to the natural slope after drawing up the elevation contour lines is called contour ploughing in soil, prevents and reduces soil erosion. Terrace Farming In terracing, wide steps are cut around the slopes of hills to prevent soil erosion.\n[8] Tillage and planting practices that reduce erosion include contour cultivation and strip-cropping. Contour cultivation is cultivation that follows the contours of a field, producing furrows that run perpendicular or at angles to the slope-line of a field.heet erosion is caused by raindrops. Sheet erosion is defined as the uniform removal of soil in thin layers from sloping land. This, of course, is nearly impossible; in reality the loose soil merely runs off with the rain.\n[9] Contour plowing is also promoted in countries with similar rainfall patterns to the United States such as western Canada and Australia. The practice is effective only on slopes with between 2% and 10% gradient and when rainfall does not exceed a certain amount within a certain period.\n[10] In the property world, a contour is an outline of a mass of land. A contour or detailed survey is done by a surveyor and required before you can start on the design of your buildings. Contour lines will be marked on the survey.Below are some tips* that can help explain the marking you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see:t is important to understand the contours of land. I find that many of our clients do not understand what a contour survey is and why it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s necessary, so here goes.\n[11] The basic principle behind preventing any erosion is find a way to lessen the impact of the cause, such as rain and wind. For prevention of rain-driven erosion, it is important to anchor the dirt down, such as with grass, or prevent water from collecting and picking up dirt as it flows down slope. A common way to prevent this is contour ploughing. What is... Making slopes into steps so that rain cannot run down a hill carrying soil off. When building terraces, it is important to stabilize the slope. -The easiest way to do this is to plant grass. If there is enough rock around it may be possible to construct a wall out of them. Contour Ploughing- Similar to terracing, except that it follows the contours of a hill more closely than terracing, possibly even encircling a hill top The contours are not wide like terraces.\n[12] Plowing and planting across the changing slope of land, rather than in straight lines, to help retain water and reduce soil erosion. Method for reducing soil erosion; plant stalks are left in the field after harvesting and the next year's crop is planted within the stalks without plowing.\n[13] 2. Use terrace farming. This type of farming uses the topography of the land to slow water flow through a series of terraces. This manipulation of the water flow prevents it from gathering speed and washing soil away from farmlands. 3. Practice contour farming. Contour farming replicates the effects of terrace farming, but on a smaller scale.\n[14] Using farming methods such as no-till (seeds are planted without plowing the soil), crop rotation (legumes are alternated with high-nitrogen demand crops), and planting or conserving tree cover near croplands we can reduce the effect of wind and rain erosion of cropland.sing farming methods such as no-till (seeds are planted without plowing the soil), crop rotation (legumes are alternated with high-nitrogen demand crops), and planting or conserving tree cover near croplands we can reduce the effect of wind and rain erosion of cropland.\n[15] 1 made so as to conform to the shape or outline of something: contour sheets for a bed. 2 characterized by the making of furrows along the natural contour lines so as to avoid erosion, as on a hillside: contour farming.\n[16] Botox\u00c2\u00ae Jaw line Contouring / Face Slimming. Botox\u00c2\u00ae injection can improve an individual's appearance in many ways, like reducing wrinkles and creases in the skin, but what many people do not know is that it can also be used for facial contouring.\n[17] The elevation or differences in elevation on the surface is usually shown as contours. A contour line is a line that connects points of equal elevation. There is usually a contour interval set, say 1-foot for conventional survey. An aerial topo survey may have a contour interval of 2-foot to 5-foot typically.Again, these contours are a way to represent the relative elevations of the surface of the land. contour line is a line that connects points of equal elevation.

Because it's impractical to mark the elevation of every contour line on the map, the index contour lines are the only ones labeled.The index contours are a darker or wider brown line in comparison to the regular contour lines.hese lines are evenly spaced apart. We call this spacing the contour interval. For example, if your map uses a 10-foot contour interval, you will see contour lines for every 10 feet (3 meters) of elevation -- lines at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and so on. Different maps use different intervals, depending on the topography.\nSearch Query: what can contour plowing reduce.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.

Furrows that run up and down a slope form a channel that can quickly carry away seeds and topsoil. Contour plowing forms ridges, slows the water flow and helps save precious topsoil. LeRoy Hoffman rented farmland for his entire farming career and remembers when the government urged farmers to change their plowing methods.\n[2] Both contour plowing and terrace farming are suitable for cultivating lands on sloping hills. Both are used to reduce soil erosion from tilled fields on slopes. In terrace farming, physical barriers (trenches, stone bunds, live hedges, or natural strips) are created along the contours to retain rain water and make it infiltrate into the soil and to minimize soil erosion.\n[3] In contour ploughing, the ruts made by the plow run perpendicular rather than parallel to slopes, generally resulting in furrows that curve around the land and are level. This method is also known for preventing tillage erosion. Tillage erosion is the soil movement and erosion by tilling a given plot of land. A similar practice is contour bunding where stones are placed around the contours of slopes.\n[4] Safeopedia explains Contour Plowing. Contour farming is done in hilly and sloped areas. Farmers who practice contour farming start by cutting levels into the hill or contoured area. This creates a series of steps on the hill on which crops are grown.\n[5] \u00e2\u0080\u0098Educators need the equivalent of the tractor, contour plowing, and hybridization.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Crop rotation, contour plowing, and the careful use of fertilizers and pest controls increased productivity, but the same techniques made it easier for bigger farms to become even more productive.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n[6] One of the earliest methods of conservation tillage came to be known as contour plowing, or plowing on the contour. Tilling the soil along the gentle slopes of a piece of cropland, instead of up and down the gradient, prevents fertile topsoil from being carried downhill by flowing rainwater.\n[7] Develop practices sustainable management of soils with the use of green roofs, paths, contour plowing and incorporation of natural barriers and minimum tillage. This may include a good system of farmer extension services, better nutrient management, contour plowing, improved seed varieties or simple irrigation.\n[8] 1. They plant shelter belts of trees to break the force of the wind 2. In dry areas, instead of plowing under the natural vegetation to plant crops, farmers graze animals on the vegetation 3. On gentle slopes, plowing along the natural contours of the land or planting crops in strips helps reduce water erosion 4.\n[9] Best Answer: 5) Which is the best way to prevent soil erosion on a farm? a) Plow fields along contour lines. 6) Freshwater is usually considered a renewable resource.

Contour plowing or contour farming or Contour bunding is the farming practice of plowing and/or planting across a slope following its elevation contour lines. These contour lines create a water break which reduces the formation of rills and gullies during times of heavy water run-off; which is a major cause of soil erosion.\n[2] Contour plowing is the act of farming on a hill or a contoured area. The plow follows the contours of the land horizontally helping to reduce runoff of water. This practice helps to prevent soil erosion in hilly and contoured areas by capturing the water runoff using water breaks to keep water contained. Contour plowing is also known as contour farming, and is a sustainable form of agriculture.\n[3] In contour plowing, the land is plowed across the slopes and along the contour lines. This will also reduce soil erosion and make rainwater infiltrate into the soil more than on land plowed along the slope. Terraces are more effective than contour plowing alone in minimizing soil erosion and facilitating infiltration f rainfall into the soil.\n[4] Contour bunding, Catalonia, 2007.

Legionella is a type of bacteria that can cause a serious form of pneumonia called Legionnaires disease. Legionella testing detects the presence of the bacteria to help diagnose the cause of a person's pneumonia.\n[2] Although several other species of the genus Legionella were subsequently identified, L pneumophila is the most frequent cause of human legionellosis and a relatively common cause of community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonia in adults.\n[3] Legionnaires' disease is a type of pneumonia. It is caused by bacteria called Legionella pneumophila. The bacteria got its name in 1976, when a group of people attending an American Legion convention became infected.ymptoms can range from mild to severe. Pontiac fever symptoms include fever and muscle aches.

Legionnaires' disease is a severe, often lethal, form of pneumonia. It's caused by the bacterium Legionella pneumophila found in both potable and nonpotable water systems.Each year, an estimated 10,000 to 18,000 people are infected with the Legionella bacteria in the United States.It is not uncommon for patients with Legionnaires' disease to be admitted to the intensive care unit. study of outbreak survivors showed persistence of fatigue (75%), neurologic symptoms (66%) and neuromuscular symptoms (63%) in months after an outbreak. See Share Your Story for a first-hand account of the severity of this disease.\n[7] Atypical organisms such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila are implicated in up to 40 percent of cases of community-acquired pneumonia. Antibiotic treatment is empiric and includes coverage for both typical and atypical organisms.\n[8] Legionellosis is an infection that is caused by the bacterium Legionella pneumophila. Legionnaires' disease is the more severe form of the infection, which may involve pneumonia. The onset of this form of the disease is usually two to 10 days after infection but can occur up to 16 days later.\n[9] Legionellosis is an infection that is caused by the bacterium Legionella pneumophila. The disease has two distinct forms: 1 Legionnaires' disease is the more severe form of the infection, which may involve pneumonia. 2 Pontiac fever is a milder illness that develops from hours to two days after initial infection and resolves spontaneously.\n[10] Medical Definition of Legionnaire disease Our Legionnaires' Disease Main Article provides a comprehensive look at the who, what, when and how of Legionnaires' Disease Legionnaire disease: A disease due to the bacteria Legionella pneumophila found in plumbing, shower heads and water-storage tanks.

Legionella bacteria are widely present at low levels in the environment: in lakes, streams, and ponds.\n[14] Legionnaire disease is an infection of the lungs and airways. It is caused by Legionella bacteria. The bacteria that cause Legionnaire disease have been found in water delivery systems. They can survive in the warm, moist air conditioning systems of large buildings, including hospitals. Most cases are caused by the bacteria Legionella pneumophila. The rest of the cases are caused by other Legionella species.\n[15] Origins of Legionnaires' Disease.

Bacteria called Legionella cause this infection. The bacteria were discovered after an outbreak at a Philadelphia convention of the American Legion in 1976. Those who were affected developed a form of pneumonia that eventually became known as Legionnaires\u00e2\u0080\u0099 disease. Legionella bacteria usually thrive in warm water.\n[18] Pneumonia due to mycoplasma and chlamydophila bacteria is usually mild. 1 Pneumonia due to Legionella pneumophila gets worse during the first 4 to 6 days, and then improves over 4 to 5 days.

LD also refers to a more benign, self-limited, acute febrile illness known as Pontiac fever, which has been linked serologically to L pneumophila, although it presents without pneumonia.\n[4] Bacterial pneumonia and less severe airway (respiratory tract) infections can be caused by one of several bacteria. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common, followed by Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. Rarely, bacterial pneumonia can be caused by Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae.\n[5] The most common cause of bacterial pneumonia is Streptococcus pneumoniae. Bacterial pneumonia can also be caused by Chlamydophila pneumonia or Legionella pneumophila. Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia is sometimes seen in those who have weak immune systems due to illnesses like AIDS or cancer.\n[6] It may be readily visualized with a silver stain. Legionella is common in many environments, including soil and aquatic systems, with at least 50 species and 70 serogroups identified.

Legionella testing detects the presence of the bacteria to help diagnose the cause of a person's pneumonia. legionella infection affects the lower respiratory tract, often requires hospitalization, and has a significant mortality rate. In addition to pneumonia, Legionella bacteria can also cause Pontiac fever, a milder and self-limiting illness with flu-like symptoms.\n[14] Legionnaires' disease is a type of pneumonia. It is caused by bacteria called Legionella pneumophila. The bacteria got its name in 1976, when a group of people attending an American Legion convention became infected.\n[15] Legionnaires' disease is a type of pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria.

Most histories concentrate on the experience of those nations supporting France in WW1. Little is said of the ordeal of those in France and Belgium whose armies struggled against a Germany that had already overrun large swathes of their countries. The French had good cause to distrust the new Germany, having lost the provinces of Alsace and Lorrain to Prussia on the Franco Prussian war of 1870/71. France in 1914 had a population of just under 40 million and an army with a mobilised strength of 1.1m. By the end of the war France had mobilised 8.6m men and lost 1.39m dead and 4.25m wounded, almost 100% more dead and 150% more wounded than comparative figures for Great Britain, with a population of 45m.\n[9] Around 17 million soldiers and civilians were killed during WW1.

By contrast, around 4% of the population of England and Wales, and considerably more than that in Scotland and Ireland, are thought to have been killed in the Civil War.\n[10] From its allies the Soviet Union got material support that was far more important to its effort than Russia got in WW1 [although it is correct to note that perhaps 75-85% of the total German war effort in 1941-3 was devoted to the east as opposed to no more than half in WW1].\n[11] The U.S entered WW1 for several reasons.

France in 1914 had a population of just under 40 million and an army with a mobilised strength of 1.1m. By the end of the war France had mobilised 8.6m men and lost 1.39m dead and 4.25m wounded, almost 100% more dead and 150% more wounded than comparative figures for Great Britain, with a population of 45m.\n[18] Information about the First World War.

On December 25, 1991, the Soviet hammer and sickle flag lowered for the last time over the Kremlin, thereafter replaced by the Russian tricolor. Earlier in the day, Mikhail Gorbachev resigned his post as president of the Soviet Union, leaving Boris Yeltsin as president of the newly independent Russian state.\n[10] \u00e2\u0080\u00a6Belarus, and Russia formed the Commonwealth of Independent States, which was then joined by eight other former republics of the defunct Soviet Union.\n[11] In a final step signifying the dismemberment of the Soviet Union, 11 of the 12 Soviet republics declare that they are forming the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).

On December 8, 1991, the Soviet Union ceased to exist. Boris Yeltsin, president of the Russian Republic, formed the Commonwealth of Independent States (C.I.S.). After 45 years, the Cold War was over.\n[14] In August 1991 Soviet hardliners staged a coup against President Gorbachev and President Yeltsin emerged as a national hero as he rallied the people from the top of a tank to keep the peace.

Visceral fat, on the other hand, lies out of reach, deep within the abdominal cavity, where it pads the spaces between our abdominal organs. Visceral fat has been linked to metabolic disturbances and increased risk for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.\n[2] Increased visceral adiposity is a pivotal component of the metabolic syndrome. Differential gene expression patterns of fat-derived peptides (FDPs) in visceral fat and subcutaneous fat have been characterized in the fasting state.Here we examined whether delivery of nutrients differentially affects the expression of FDPs in visceral fat versus subcutaneous fat (in the fed state).ifferential gene expression patterns of fat-derived peptides (FDPs) in visceral fat and subcutaneous fat have been characterized in the fasting state.

The parietal pleura folds back on itself at the root of the lung to become the visceral pleura. In health the two pleurae are in contact. When the lung collapses, however, or when air or liquid collects between the two membranes, the pleural cavity or sac becomes apparent (see pleurisy).\n[6] The visceral pleura which coats the outer surface of the lung is derived from the splanchnic mesoderm. The parietal pleura lining the thoracic cavity is derived from somatic mesoderm. The pleural cavity is a potential space between the two areas of pleural membrane, which normally are adhesed to each other.ach lung is placed within a separate layer of membrane, thus there are two pleural sacs. The space between the two sacs is known as the mediastinum, and is almost in the midline of the thorax. The pleura covering the surface of the lung is known as pulmonary pleura or visceral pleura.\n[7] Visceral fat is also different in that it remains the same shape and won't fall to your sides or sink into your stomach when you are lying down. High visceral fat is dangerous and is correlated with cholesterol, diabetes, Alzheimer's and other conditions.his is because visceral fat is the fat that is located inside the abdominal cavity packed between organs rather than underneath the skin (subcutaneous fat) and this fat will release acids that are metabolized by the liver and which can cause insulin resistance in the liver.\n[8] The ribs surround the lungs in the thorasica cavity.

'Along with killing you, visceral fat, it seems, can make you feel low.'. Visceral fat is the internal fatty tissue that wraps itself around the heart, liver, kidneys and pancreas, and streaks through muscles.Scientists don't know exactly what causes people to lay down visceral fat, although it has been linked to a high-fat diet.But they do know it behaves differently from the largely benign fat that lies just below the skin (the sort you can pinch between your fingers). Visceral fat is dangerously toxic.As Dr David Haslam, clinical director of the National Obesity Forum, explains: 'Visceral fat may seem to be an inert lump of lard, but it's actually highly active and constantly pumping poisons into the bloodstream.'.cientists don't know exactly what causes people to lay down visceral fat, although it has been linked to a high-fat diet.

Between the parietal and visceral pleura is the pleural cavity, which creates a hollow space for the lungs to expand into during inhalation.\n[9] Fat in the lower body, as in thighs and buttocks, is subcutaneous and is not consistently spaced tissue, whereas fat in the abdomen is mostly visceral and semi-fluid. Visceral fat is composed of several adipose depots, including mesenteric, epididymal white adipose tissue (EWAT), and perirenal depots.isceral fat or abdominal fat (also known as organ fat or intra-abdominal fat) is located inside the abdominal cavity, packed between the organs (stomach, liver, intestines, kidneys, etc.). Visceral fat is different from subcutaneous fat underneath the skin, and intramuscular fat interspersed in skeletal muscles.\n[10] Much of the fat in the stomach area lies directly under the skin.

The parietal pleura folds back on itself at the root of the lung to become the visceral pleura. In health the two pleurae are in contact. When the lung collapses, however, or when air or liquid collects between the two membranes, the pleural cavity or sac becomes apparent (see pleurisy).\n[15] The visceral pleura which coats the outer surface of the lung is derived from the splanchnic mesoderm. The parietal pleura lining the thoracic cavity is derived from somatic mesoderm. The pleural cavity is a potential space between the two areas of pleural membrane, which normally are adhesed to each other.ach lung is placed within a separate layer of membrane, thus there are two pleural sacs.

The parietal pleura lining the thoracic cavity is derived from somatic mesoderm.\n[9] Notes. pleura. serous membrane lining the pleural cavity. there are two types of pleura: visceral pleura covers the lungs, parietal pleura lines the inner surfaces of the walls of pleural cavity; parietal pleura is sensitive to pain but visceral pleura is not sensitive to pain.\n[10] The two lungs and their pleural sacs are situated in the thoracic cavity (figs. 22-1 and 22-2). The pleura is a thin, glistening, slippery serous membrane, inflammation of which is called pleurisy. The pleura lines the thoracic wall and diaphragm, where it is known as the parietal pleura. It is reflected onto the lung, where it is called the visceral pleura. The visceral pleura covers the lung and dips into its fissures. The facing surfaces of the parietal and visceral pleurae slide smoothly against each other during respiration.\n[11] Definition of visceral. 1 1 : felt in or as if in the internal organs of the body : deep a visceral conviction. 2 2 : not intellectual : instinctive, unreasoning visceral drives. 3 3 : dealing with crude or elemental emotions : earthy a visceral novel. 4 : of, relating to, or located on or among the viscera : splanchnic visceral organs.\n[12] Definition of visceral. 1 1 : felt in or as if in the internal organs of the body : deep a visceral conviction. 2 2 : not intellectual : instinctive, unreasoning visceral drives. 3 3 : dealing with crude or elemental emotions : earthy a visceral novel. 4 4 : of, relating to, or located on or among the viscera : splanchnic visceral organs.\n[13] The visceral pleura envelops the lung, and the parietal pleura lines the inner chest wall.

The pleural cavity is a potential space between the parietal and visceral pleura. It contains a small volume of serous fluid, which has two major functions. It lubricates the surfaces of the pleurae, allowing them to slide over each other.\n[19] Much of the fat in the stomach area lies directly under the skin.

Visceral fat surrounds your vital organs, the fat is located in the abdominal cavity (stomach area). According to researchers from Duke University Medical Center, exercise can significantly reduce the amount of visceral fat you carry around. The more exercise you do, the more of this type of dangerous fat you will lose.

Parietal pericardium. Visceral pericardium.\n[6] Visceral fat or abdominal fat (also known as organ fat or intra-abdominal fat) is located inside the abdominal cavity, packed between the organs (stomach, liver, intestines, kidneys, etc.). Visceral fat is different from subcutaneous fat underneath the skin, and intramuscular fat interspersed in skeletal muscles.at in the lower body, as in thighs and buttocks, is subcutaneous and is not consistently spaced tissue, whereas fat in the abdomen is mostly visceral and semi-fluid. Visceral fat is composed of several adipose depots, including mesenteric, epididymal white adipose tissue (EWAT), and perirenal depots.\n[7] The lungs are surrounded by two membranes, the pleurae.

The parietal pleura is everything else. The same is true of the pericardium: if it directly touches the heart, it is visceral, but if it only contacts other tissue (including visceral pleura), it is parietal.\n[10] A serous membrane (also referred to as a serosa) is one of the thin membranes that cover the walls and organs in the thoracic and abdominopelvic cavities.

In a health setting, the word visceral means in or near your vital organs (your viscera). These are the organs deep in your gut, like your stomach and your intestines. Visceral muscles are found in the walls of your visceral organs. Visceral fat surrounds those organs. Since your vital organs are located in your midsection, visceral fat accumulates in the area around your belly. But not all belly fat is visceral fat. There is another kind of fat called subcutaneous fat. Subcutaneous fat is located underneath the skin.\n[14] Visceral fat is linked to diabetes and heart disease much more than BMI (body mass index.) Researchers believe that visceral fat may just be a side effect of an unhealthy lifestyle.What is important to know is that most people with a lot of belly fat also have a lot of visceral fat.If you want to get rid of visceral fat and lower your risk for heart disease and diabetes, start with cutting down on your calories and getting more exercise.his is called subcutaneous fat and is not necessarily hazardous to your health.

The visceral or pulmonary pleura covers the outside of the lungs, and the parietal or costal pleura lines the inside of the chest wall, and it extends over the top of diaphragm.\n[8] Notes. pleura. serous membrane lining the pleural cavity. there are two types of pleura: visceral pleura covers the lungs, parietal pleura lines the inner surfaces of the walls of pleural cavity; parietal pleura is sensitive to pain but visceral pleura is not sensitive to pain.otes. pleura. serous membrane lining the pleural cavity. there are two types of pleura: visceral pleura covers the lungs, parietal pleura lines the inner surfaces of the walls of pleural cavity; parietal pleura is sensitive to pain but visceral pleura is not sensitive to pain.\n[9] Notes. pleura. serous membrane lining the pleural cavity. there are two types of pleura: visceral pleura covers the lungs, parietal pleura lines the inner surfaces of the walls of pleural cavity; parietal pleura is sensitive to pain but visceral pleura is not sensitive to pain.pleura, cervical parietal.here are two types of pleura: visceral pleura covers the lungs, parietal pleura lines the inner surfaces of the walls of pleural cavity; parietal pleura is sensitive to pain but visceral pleura is not sensitive to pain. pleura, cervical parietal.\n[10] In summary, each pleural cavity is defined by a space surrounding each lung and lined by a pleural membrane.

Visceral fat is different from subcutaneous fat underneath the skin, and intramuscular fat interspersed in skeletal muscles.at in the lower body, as in thighs and buttocks, is subcutaneous and is not consistently spaced tissue, whereas fat in the abdomen is mostly visceral and semi-fluid. Visceral fat is composed of several adipose depots, including mesenteric, epididymal white adipose tissue (EWAT), and perirenal depots.\n[15] Type 2 diabetes can be caused by storing high amounts of visceral fat. Visceral fat is body fat that is stored within the abdominal cavity and is therefore stored around a number of important internal organs such as the liver, pancreas and intestines.ype 2 diabetes can be caused by storing high amounts of visceral fat. Visceral fat is body fat that is stored within the abdominal cavity and is therefore stored around a number of important internal organs such as the liver, pancreas and intestines.\n[16] Dangerous visceral fat builds up if you don't exercise, can go down if you do. If you lead a sedentary life you risk building up large amounts of visceral fat in your body. WHAT IS VISCERAL FAT? Visceral fat surrounds your vital organs, the fat is located in the abdominal cavity (stomach area). According to researchers from Duke University Medical Center, exercise can significantly reduce the amount of visceral fat you carry around. The more exercise you do, the more of this type of dangerous fat you will lose. Researchers in this study said that extra exercise can reverse the amount you have, while some moderate exercise can stop your visceral fat mounting up.\n[17] The reason is that there are two different kinds of fat in your belly and visceral fat is only one of them. In a health setting, the word visceral means in or near your vital organs (your viscera). These are the organs deep in your gut, like your stomach and your intestines. Visceral muscles are found in the walls of your visceral organs. Visceral fat surrounds those organs. Since your vital organs are located in your midsection, visceral fat accumulates in the area around your belly. But not all belly fat is visceral fat. There is another kind of fat called subcutaneous fat. Subcutaneous fat is located underneath the skin.\n[18] The pleura is a membrane which lines the thoracic cavity (parietal pleura) and covers the lungs (visceral pleura).The parietal pleura folds back on itself at the root of the lung to become the visceral pleura. In health the two pleurae are in contact.he pleura is a membrane which lines the thoracic cavity (parietal pleura) and covers the lungs (visceral pleura).\n[19] there are two types of pleura: visceral pleura covers the lungs, parietal pleura lines the inner surfaces of the walls of pleural cavity; parietal pleura is sensitive to pain but visceral pleura is not sensitive to pain.pleura, cervical parietal.here are two types of pleura: visceral pleura covers the lungs, parietal pleura lines the inner surfaces of the walls of pleural cavity; parietal pleura is sensitive to pain but visceral pleura is not sensitive to pain. pleura, cervical parietal.\n[20] there are two types of pleura: visceral pleura covers the lungs, parietal pleura lines the inner surfaces of the walls of pleural cavity; parietal pleura is sensitive to pain but visceral pleura is not sensitive to pain.pleura, cervical parietal.here are two types of pleura: visceral pleura covers the lungs, parietal pleura lines the inner surfaces of the walls of pleural cavity; parietal pleura is sensitive to pain but visceral pleura is not sensitive to pain.\nSearch Query: define visceral?.\nRank the 20 passages above based on their relevance to the search query.
